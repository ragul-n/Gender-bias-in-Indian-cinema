1
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,710
Ma.

2
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,240
It's usually the
first word we speak.

3
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,070
A word that's
impossible to define...

4
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,630
Because no other
words can do it justice.

5
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,820
Mothers are considered
greater than God.

6
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,470
They're synonymous with sacrifice.

7
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,600
But my mother isn't like that.

8
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,150
Today, I'm doing what perhaps
no daughter has done before.

9
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm filing a criminal
case against my mother.

10
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,770
There she is.

11
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Ms. Anupama Banerji...

12
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,740
Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

13
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,920
This is Mr Graham, the mediator.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

15
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
You okay?

16
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,600
So, Ms. Banerji, you have
accused Ms. Shakuntala Devi

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,920
of illegally trying to destroy
your financial standing.

18
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,480
She is your mother, and a
world-famous mathematician.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,250
Are world-famous
mathematicians above the law?

20
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,370
This could lead to
a jail sentence for her.

21
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,350
Are you absolutely
certain you want to do this?

22
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
Yes.

23
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,190
Yes, I am.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,730
My mother tore me away
from every person I ever loved.

25
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,410
But not anymore.

26
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,320
Even if it means going to war...

27
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,950
Against the 'great' Shakuntala Devi.

28
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,680
16777216...

29
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,100
So the first set is 216...

30
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,350
Then 716.

31
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,830
2 x 2 = 4

32
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,370
4 x 2 = 8

33
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,430
256?

34
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,090
- What did you say?
- Your cube root.

35
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
This?

36
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,830
This is an eight digit number.

37
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,700
And you're five years old!

38
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
Shakuntala!

39
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,170
How did you do it?

40
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,470
It just comes to me naturally!

41
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
Liar!

42
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,700
I'm not a liar!

43
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,650
Then explain how you did it!

44
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,440
I can't explain it.
I can only show you.

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,186
Can you only do cube roots,
or is there more up your sleeve?

46
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,060
Give me sweets and I'll tell you!

47
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,170
Forget sweets. I'll give you money.

48
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,940
You can buy anything with it.

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,940
Anything?

50
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,110
Yes!

51
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,630
Solve this.

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,180
Uncle! Aunty!

53
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,300
Look what Shakuntala did!

54
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,580
Oh Lord. What did she do now?

55
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,830
I was studying.

56
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,620
I was calculating the
cube root of an 8 digit number...

57
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,820
And she gave the answer in a flash!

58
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,580
It must have been a fluke...

59
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,890
No, really! See for yourself.

60
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,630
Solve this.

61
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,020
I won't do it for free! Pay up.

62
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,520
Okay, take this.

63
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,030
And for the other one?

64
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,880
She's more mercenary
than the British empire!

65
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,540
Here. Solve it now.

66
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,000
512, which is also the cube of 8.

67
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,300
Now can I go buy my sweets?

68
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,510
Uncle, she's no ordinary girl.

69
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,090
She's a genius!

70
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,600
Genie what?

71
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,970
Ge-ni-us.

72
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,690
A brilliant mind
that's one in a million.

73
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,920
Shakuntala, you're late for school!

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,180
Shakuntala, you're late for school!

75
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,190
Shaku, you're late for school!

76
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,150
There she comes.

77
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,600
This tiny girl - she's
your mathematical genius?

78
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,180
So who's going to give
me math problems to solve?

79
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,120
Teachers can ask too.

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,620
Just a request.

81
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,190
Ask difficult questions...

82
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,480
Or she'll get bored.

83
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,870
So, Math genius...

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,650
I hope this question won't bore you?

85
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,610
What are you doing?

86
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,470
They come in my way.

87
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,650
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

88
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Come on.

89
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Shakuntala!

90
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,670
Father, I want to go to school too.

91
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,430
We are going, right?

92
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,600
3 pm, Naivediyam Public School.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,630
Father, not for Maths shows.

94
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,510
To study like other kids.

95
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,630
What can a school teach you?

96
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,720
You'll end up teaching them.

97
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,570
Come, let's go.

98
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,540
Shakuntala, you need to practice.
Get inside.

99
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,450
I want to play with Sharda.

100
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,890
You're booked for
ten shows next week.

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,380
Why must you make your father angry?

102
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,780
Unlike you, I'm not scared of him!

103
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,700
Is that how you talk
about your father?

104
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,370
He isn't my father. I'm his father!

105
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
What are you saying?

106
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,660
What do fathers in other homes do?

107
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,920
They work, earn money
and run the household.

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,720
So who's the father
in this house then?

109
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,910
Shakuntala!

110
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,550
Yes, I'll get her.

111
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,150
Come along.

112
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,660
I won't.

113
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,770
Come on!

114
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,096
What goes around comes around.

115
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,480
Wait till your daughter
gives you a hard time!

116
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,960
Shaku, you aren't
afraid of anyone, right?

117
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,000
Mark my words.
You'll be a big man someday.

118
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,270
Why would I be a man?

119
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,610
Because there's no such
thing as a 'big woman'!

120
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,510
In that case,
I'll definitely be a big woman.

121
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,860
And you'll always be by my side!

122
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,410
"God-Promise"?

123
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,450
God-Promise!

124
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,640
Sharda!

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,500
Sharda!

126
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,250
Sharda, wake up!

127
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,690
Why didn't you take
Sharda to the hospital?

128
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,850
It would have cost a lot of money.

129
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,910
I do shows day and night.
Where did all the money go?

130
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,090
If we try to save the dying, we'll
have nothing left for the living.

131
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,220
Mother, I'm talking to you!

132
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,420
Have you lost your voice?

133
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,650
Why can't you speak
up in front of Father?

134
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,410
Shakuntala!

135
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,790
I'll never forgive
our mother, Sharda.

136
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,160
I promise you - one day,
I'll be a very big woman.

137
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,890
And I won't be like our mother ever.

138
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,970
God-promise.

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,090
Miss Shakuntala!

140
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,620
Here's your money for today's
performance. In advance.

141
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
Thanks.

142
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,220
You can leave now.

143
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,680
No, I'll stay.

144
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,020
No, carry on.

145
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,210
Take a rickshaw.
And buy vegetables on the way.

146
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't be too late.

147
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Hello.

148
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,200
Myself Shakuntala.

149
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,090
Who is having first question for me?

150
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,610
Arun, ask her a question!

151
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,810
No, you guys go ahead.

152
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,710
You cleared your CA exam
in three months, man! Shoot!

153
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,940
- No man...
- Come on!

154
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,520
Myself Arun.

155
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,980
Hello Arun. So what's your question?

156
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,060
I've been offered a
job at a British Company.

157
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,330
Congrats!

158
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,656
The joining date is in April.

159
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
I see.

160
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,540
But I can't decide whether
I should accept the job or not.

161
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
Why?

162
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,050
Well, their salary
structure is a bit strange.

163
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,830
On the first day,
they'll pay me one paisa.

164
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,220
On the second day, two paisas.

165
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,816
On the third day, four paisas.

166
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,610
And on the fourth day, eight paisas.

167
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,900
Basically, the pay
will be doubled every day.

168
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,390
What do you think...

169
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,430
Should I take up the job?

170
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
I don't know if you
listened carefully...

171
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,760
But Arun said he's
required to join in April...

172
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,810
And April has 30 days.

173
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,030
Wow, ma'am! You really are a genius.

174
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,780
You know that April has 30 days!

175
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,180
A round of applause for the lady!

176
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,120
Arun, since you're
joining a British Company

177
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,740
should I give you the
answer in Pounds or Rupees?

178
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,820
Rupees will do, I guess.

179
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,710
Okay.

180
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,720
So your salary would be...

181
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,540
I am correct?

182
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,540
Arun, is she right?

183
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,000
She is!

184
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,920
So Arun, which company is this?

185
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,690
Can ladies apply too?

186
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,080
They looked like
they had seen a ghost.

187
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,550
Is it so weird to see
a woman solve math problems?

188
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,840
Well, women here usually only
solve household problems. Right?

189
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,170
That requires Maths too!

190
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,500
No one can win against you, my love!

191
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,010
Did you tell your mother about us?

192
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,940
My love, we're going to
Alam's estate to hunt pheasants.

193
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,530
I'll talk to her
as soon as we're back.

194
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,090
I've been hearing
this for a year now.

195
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,440
"I'll tell her after my
sister's engagement..."

196
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,450
"After my grandmother's
death anniversary..."

197
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,760
"As soon as my father's
back from Madras..."

198
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,330
It's getting late. Let me
drop you home. Okay?

199
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,580
I'll be right back
with the car keys...

200
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
My love.

201
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,860
Ms. Sukanya Gowthami
weds Mr. Dheeraj Murthy

202
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,220
Congratulations.

203
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,610
My love, marriage in India
is like a deal fixed by our parents.

204
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,316
My love, nothing's
going to change between us!

205
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,690
Firstly, stop this 'my
love' nonsense of yours!

206
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,500
Shakuntala...

207
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,420
My father went ahead and fixed
me a match from within our caste.

208
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,170
They're a family
of money and repute.

209
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,900
I make money too, Dheeraj.

210
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,100
Exactly! You're very independent.

211
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,930
I come from an ordinary family,
Shakuntala...

212
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,480
And you aren't ordinary in any way.

213
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,270
Yeah Dheeraj, I'm not ordinary.

214
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,190
You know what an ordinary
girl would do in my place?

215
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
My love!

216
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,400
Lady! Care for some flowers?

217
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Come...

218
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,830
This is Shakuntala Devi,
from Bangalore.

219
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Hello.

220
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Please sit.

221
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,920
Would you like some pilaf?

222
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,410
Just tea, please.

223
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,490
Okay.

224
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,730
Crumbling outside, bustling inside.

225
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,380
Welcome to Tarabai's guesthouse!

226
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
Thank you.

227
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,360
Ms. Shakuntala, don't mind...

228
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
But we've never seen
any single ladies here before.

229
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why?

230
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,170
What about me?

231
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,350
She's come here to build her future,
just like you.

232
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,690
Right?

233
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,320
Actually... I've come here
to escape from my past.

234
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,880
What's so dark about your past?

235
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,500
I shot a man.

236
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,840
Why aren't you in jail, then?

237
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,160
He didn't die.

238
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,820
Only one ear got blown off.

239
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,130
It bled quite a bit though.

240
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
What happened?

241
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,440
Please eat!

242
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Come on, guys!

243
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,050
Shakuntala's obviously joking.

244
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
She's joking!

245
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,310
I was going to start sleeping
with a stick at night!

246
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,780
Tarabai, I scared your houseguests
right on arrival, didn't I!

247
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,320
A girl who follows her heart

248
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,050
and laughs with abandon...

249
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,200
What could be more scary to men?

250
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,580
I swear.

251
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,810
I've never understood this disparity
between men and women!

252
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,410
That's why you're so special!

253
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,890
You managed to escape the
Dheeraj incident and get here.

254
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,000
But how will you
pay next month's rent?

255
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,510
I have my Maths!

256
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,390
A Math show, did you say, love?

257
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Yes!

258
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,200
People are giving
me difficult sums...

259
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,770
And I am giving them
answers quickly-quickly!

260
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,806
Why do you think people
will part with their good money...

261
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,570
To see something stupid like that?

262
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,610
I can't possibly allow my girls

263
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,980
who come from all over the world...

264
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,210
To be exposed to this mumbo-jumbo!

265
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,810
An Indian woman
in a sari and pigtails

266
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,250
doing mathematical
sums on stage is a joke!

267
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,930
Sir. Joke also - Indian
man in loincloth with a stick.

268
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,620
But he won!

269
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,290
There you are.

270
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
All yours.

271
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,060
That's astonishing.
How did you do that?

272
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,330
I'm correct?

273
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,100
Indeed you are!

274
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,630
Thank you.

275
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,490
Is audience having
any more question for me?

276
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,570
Great stuff with the mathematics...

277
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,230
But we're going to need a translator
for this fresh-off-the-boat English!

278
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,500
Excuse me.

279
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,630
That was...

280
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,490
Did they teach you some special
mental-math technique at University?

281
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,230
I'm never going to any school.

282
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
Then how University?

283
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,730
You didn't go to school?

284
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,970
I'm having no childhood only...

285
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm Javier, by the way.

286
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,140
'Havee', means?

287
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,390
J-A-V-I-E-R. Javier.

288
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,920
What happened to J?

289
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,300
The J is silent.

290
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,550
See! Alphabets, so much confusion.

291
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,560
Numbers, no confusion!

292
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,530
What you see is what you getting.

293
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,930
What you're getting is a cold.

294
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes.

295
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,640
Because, it's 'Hanuary', no?
The J is silent!

296
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,720
Would you care for
a hot English cup of tea?

297
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Sure!

298
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,860
Three spoons of sugar!

299
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,820
Otherwise your English Chai
is not having any taste only.

300
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,490
I'm not English.
I'm from Spain originally.

301
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,250
Oh I see!
All you white guys look the same!

302
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,570
Shakuntala, what is it that
you love about being on stage?

303
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,370
People's faces, when they see
a girl in chotis doing maths.

304
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,790
Choti?

305
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,900
Plaits!

306
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,150
Oh!

307
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,030
So many years people are singing,
dancing, doing drama, circus on stage.

308
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,800
Then why I cannot do Maths on stage?

309
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,700
Shakuntala, then allow me to take
your Math performance to the next level!

310
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,920
Next level?

311
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,070
You mean third floor?

312
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,100
The world needs to see you,
Shakuntala.

313
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,360
But it would require what one
would call a bit of a... makeover?

314
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,770
But I have one condition...

315
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,050
Mr 'Javier With J Silent'.

316
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,400
Means...
my Saree isn't going anywhere.

317
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,030
God-Promise.

318
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,410
What?

319
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,270
Means, if you are
breaking this promise...

320
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,250
I will lose all my talent.

321
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,130
That's pretty dramatic.

322
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,360
We Indians are like that only.

323
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,680
Drama or nothing!

324
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,386
"Betty Botter bought
a bit of butter..."

325
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,596
"But the butter Betty Botter bought was
a bit bitter and made her batter bitter."

326
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,730
"Crazy Camels, Calm Camels,
the Camel Clans Clashed!"

327
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,800
I thought I was the teacher here.

328
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,480
Teaching means learning everyday,
J-Silent.

329
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, you go first.

330
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,516
"Betty Botter bought
a bit of butter..."

331
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,740
"But the butter Betty Botter bought was
a bit bitter and made her batter bitter."

332
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
Now you!

333
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,280
Donning butterfly wings

334
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,250
To the west the easterlies blow

335
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,810
Washing over this Spring

336
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,080
Is an all new glow

337
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,550
Save the heart from the evil eye

338
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,040
With all the joy it's taken in

339
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,620
I dream in English now

340
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,090
Life's made a new beginning

341
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,900
This story's taken a turn

342
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,800
I do what the heart yearns

343
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,430
Never mind the English Queen

344
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,880
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

345
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,830
This story's taken a turn

346
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,430
I do what the heart yearns

347
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,200
Never mind the English Queen

348
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,660
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

349
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,540
Now say, Mrs. Astrid Moore
asks you to multiply

350
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,380
Take the first digit, which is 8
And multiply it by 8+1 which is...

351
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,560
Nine!

352
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,240
Multiply 8 X 9, which is

353
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,310
Take the two 5's from the
units place and multiply them.

354
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,670
5 X 5 is...

355
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,290
Put the two together
and what's your answer?

356
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,600
How are you?

357
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,430
Jolly good. How about you?

358
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,620
I'm a bit poorly.

359
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,910
Oh blimey!
Let me get you a cup of tea!

360
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,300
Ah, that's so awfully kind of you!

361
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,590
Thank you!

362
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
Now onto the next trick.

363
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
May I request His Excellency,
the Spanish Ambassador

364
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,600
to tell us his favourite year?

365
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,310
That would be 1935, Senorita.

366
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,220
And favourite date in a month?

367
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,470
Let's see... the 14th!

368
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,550
Okay.

369
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,210
Now I am going to tell you
on which days of the week

370
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,610
the 14th of each
month occurred in 1935.

371
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,510
Please check!

372
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,120
Beginning with January...

373
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,660
- Am I correct?
- Si Si perfecto, Senora!

374
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,470
Gracias!

375
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,010
This story's taken a turn

376
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,360
I do what the heart yearns

377
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,080
Never mind the English Queen

378
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,710
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

379
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,180
Tarabai! I got five more shows!

380
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,840
I'll pay this month's
rent in advance!

381
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,560
Look who's rolling in riches!

382
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,030
There's a letter for you from home.

383
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,420
Dear Shakuntala...

384
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,550
It's been six months
since you left for London...

385
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,710
And you haven't
sent a penny home yet.

386
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,220
You know your father's temper...

387
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,780
So I'm writing this
letter with Srinivas' help.

388
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,840
Don't you have any responsibility
towards your family?

389
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,160
Sharda's no more,
but we're still here.

390
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,150
They treat me like a bank,
not a daughter!

391
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,490
Didn't even ask once,
'Shaku, how are you?'

392
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,340
That doesn't mean
they don't love you!

393
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,370
They've never asked, Tarabai!

394
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,910
And from now on, I won't ask either.

395
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,570
Wait, Shakuntala!

396
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,460
Mother, you needn't
write to me again.

397
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,280
You will get your money every month.

398
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,020
Dear friends across the airwaves...

399
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,070
Let's see if ShakuntalaDevi
makes India proud next!

400
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,270
Shall compete against the fastest
computer on London's top TV channel!

401
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,690
After the great Aryabhatt
and Ramanujan...

402
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,570
Let's see if Shakuntala
Devi makes India proud next!

403
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,220
Stay calm...

404
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,690
Speak clearly...

405
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Don't get nervous.

406
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,380
J-Silent, be silent.

407
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,830
My numbers never let me down.

408
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,450
Shakuntala...

409
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,220
There is something
I need to tell you.

410
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,610
"Crazy Camels, Calm Camels..."

411
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,210
"The Camel Clans Clashed!"

412
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
That's right!

413
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,530
Not bad Ms. Devi, not bad at all.

414
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,850
Now Ms. Devi, could you
give us the cube root of

415
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,630
923. Am I correct?

416
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,856
Ms. Devi, I think we are ready
to take this to the next level!

417
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,980
You mean third floor?

418
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
I'm sorry?

419
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,320
It would be my absolute pleasure.

420
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,060
Ms. Devi, are you able
to give us the cube root of

421
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Come on, Ms. Devi.

422
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,220
All of India is looking
at you with bated breath.

423
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm afraid this question is wrong.

424
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,970
Are you suggesting the
computer is wrong, Ms. Devi?

425
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,100
The computer has already
given its answer.

426
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,730
The question is not wrong.

427
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,880
I could show you where
the computer went wrong.

428
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,170
Thanks to Lord Ganesha,
my answers are never wrong.

429
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,220
This isn't the Great
Indian Rope Trick, Ms. Devi.

430
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,260
Though you do look like
you're at the end of your rope.

431
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,050
No, the computer has made a mistake.

432
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,580
Actually, three mistakes...

433
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,460
You know, I was quite excited
that a lady mathematician

434
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,970
from the land of snake
charmers and elephants

435
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,020
could somehow beat the computer.

436
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,300
But not everyone can
be Einstein, can they?

437
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,350
All I'm asking you is to check the last
three digits of the number please...

438
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,430
Unfortunately, that's all
we have time for today.

439
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,110
No, can you-

440
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,790
- Goodnight and see you next week!
- Can you please check it once?

441
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,940
He's right, isn't he?

442
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,300
Humans make mistakes,
computers don't. Right?

443
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,320
But I can't be wrong!

444
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,290
Why? Aren't you human?

445
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,150
The entire country
had its eyes on me.

446
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,920
Everyone's laughing at me, Tarabai.

447
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,740
Shakuntala! Shakuntala.

448
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,370
Someone's here to see you,
come down quick!

449
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,440
I don't want to meet anyone.

450
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,010
Just come! And wash your face.
Enough of this crying!

451
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,110
Come on quickly.

452
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,340
Good morning.

453
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,610
Is this any time to
show me your silly grin?

454
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,810
The TV has been flooded
with calls from people

455
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,420
asking them to re-check
the question last night!

456
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,350
I made a few calls myself!

457
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,140
Had gin early in the morning?

458
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,030
The people got experts
to do the calculations manually...

459
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,370
And you were right!

460
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,140
The computer made a rounding error.

461
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,590
That's exactly that I
was trying to tell that idiot...

462
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,270
That the last three digits
of that number were jumbled up!

463
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,350
Darling you're speaking
in Hindi again!

464
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,920
The number they gave me was

465
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,940
And he said the answer is 166917.

466
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,330
But when any number ending in 7 is
multiplied by itself three times...

467
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,070
The answer has to end in 3!

468
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,590
So the cube of 166917
has to end in 3!

469
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,630
So the correct question
would have been

470
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,310
I was correct.
The computer was wrong!

471
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,890
And that's why they named
you the Human Computer!

472
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,510
Huh?

473
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,750
God-promise!

474
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,080
You're all over the papers. Look.

475
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,810
Shakuntala...

476
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,090
My Human Computer.

477
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,660
The world is calling.

478
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,480
Are you ready?

479
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Are you done?

480
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,190
- Done.
- Okay.

481
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,180
So do you want me to
give you the answer

482
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,586
from left to right or right to left?

483
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,796
I'll give it to you from
right to left. Please take it down?

484
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
The answer is...

485
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Am I correct?

486
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,920
Absolutely correct!

487
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,520
Sari-clad calculating prodigy
confounds Maths experts

488
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,220
The Indian Human Computer
wows Europe

489
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,010
Devi in Demand: Makes
Maths Entertaining

490
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,716
Human Computer knows how
to convert her Maths into Money!

491
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,600
Shakuntala Devi: A True
Rags-to-Riches story

492
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,030
Shelly!

493
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,580
Shakuntala!

494
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Tarabai!

495
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,090
Welcome to Shakuntala's palace!

496
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,970
British house, British clothes!

497
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,510
But I still only wear
sarees at my shows, Tarabai!

498
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,220
So how many cities did
you tour last month, Shakuntala?

499
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,740
Thirteen, my dear Gordanbhai!

500
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Goodness!

501
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,620
I haven't seen thirteen
cities in my entire lifetime!

502
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,130
Why, Tarabai!

503
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,930
We're humans, not trees.

504
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,670
We have legs, not roots.

505
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,530
Tell me why?

506
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,330
Why?

507
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,410
So we can roam the world!

508
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
Shakuntala...

509
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,680
J-Silent... Hi!

510
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,800
Can we talk?

511
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,530
What do you mean,
you're going back to Spain?

512
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,110
You always knew this day would come.

513
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,400
I also know I'm
going to die someday.

514
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,640
Doesn't mean I'm okay with it.

515
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,290
You are rich and famous!

516
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,720
You don't need me, Shakuntala.

517
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,060
Why do men always
want women to need them?

518
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,250
Shakuntala, I'm sorry...

519
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,570
Javier With J Silent...

520
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,650
I'm sorry that my love
isn't enough for you.

521
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Go.

522
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,460
Find someone who needs you.

523
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Go!

524
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,550
Look Sharda, I've become
such a big woman.

525
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,970
But you're still the one I talk to
in the middle of the night.

526
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,110
Cheers!

527
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I'll talk to her.

528
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,696
- No.
- Yeah, let me talk to her!

529
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,520
- No!
- Let's end this daily soap opera.

530
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,790
Let's just finish it off and-

531
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,930
No, no Ajay!

532
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,660
- No. Please, no!
- Why not?

533
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,136
You know I don't
want to talk to her!

534
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,560
- Okay fine, but I can-
- Ajay, no.

535
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,450
Why not?

536
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,400
Sorry sir! It took a while
to get the keys from office.

537
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Please come.

538
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,000
They told me in the office that
you're Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

539
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,840
You're so lucky...

540
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,770
Your mother's such a genius!

541
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,370
I was ten years old when
she visited our school...

542
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,400
She changed my life.

543
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,400
I was a duffer in class,
and I became a topper!

544
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,720
Your Maths must be very good too.
Right, ma'am?

545
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,250
I hate Maths.

546
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,620
Okay, there are two bedrooms here.

547
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,136
You can build more rooms upstairs,
if you plan to have kids in the future.

548
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,570
We're never having kids.

549
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Sorry, sir.

550
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,710
We're not buying this
house for ourselves.

551
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,590
Anu's business,
I mean our business...

552
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,860
We buy such houses,
refurbish them...

553
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,960
We decorate and resell them.

554
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,000
I see! So different
from Shakuntala Devi, no?

555
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,256
Yes, I'm nothing
like Shakuntala Devi...

556
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,410
And I'm buying this house,
not Shakuntala Devi.

557
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,150
I hate Maths and I don't want
to ever be a mother.

558
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,536
Will you still sell us this house

559
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,880
or should we call another broker?

560
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,750
Ajay...

561
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,496
Didn't I tell you before marriage...

562
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,590
That you don't want kids.
And I respect that.

563
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,370
But why did you get
mad at that poor guy?

564
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,570
I'm tired, Ajay.

565
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,570
Everyone just sees me
as Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

566
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,070
But I only see you!

567
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,890
I know my dreams aren't big...

568
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,340
But they're your own!

569
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Own it!

570
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,280
Exactly.

571
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Exactly!

572
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,150
I don't want to be a genius.

573
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,000
Don't be one!

574
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,306
I don't want to conquer the world.

575
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:29,890
We won't.

576
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,930
I don't want to be on the covers
of top magazines.

577
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,970
- Or be on TV.
- Then don't!

578
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,790
Aunty, please have this.

579
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,150
Ma, have this. I've made it.

580
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,080
Sure, I believe you.

581
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,640
Such a cutie-pie he is!

582
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,530
Do you know...

583
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,940
Before he was born,
we had a puppy too.

584
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,690
I was always away,
thanks to my posting.

585
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,000
So the puppy gave her
company as well as practice.

586
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,350
Practice for what?

587
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,390
Taking care of babies!

588
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,010
Ajay. I need to get
the lasagna out of the oven.

589
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,090
Can you come help?

590
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Excuse me.

591
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,520
Nice smell!

592
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
What?

593
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,490
That's the oven bell ringing,
not my biological clock!

594
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,930
So don't get too excited!

595
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,300
What are you talking about?

596
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,840
Did you think Dennis will
awaken my maternal instincts?

597
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,490
I'll suddenly turn
into Mother India?

598
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,540
If this was so important to you,
why did you marry me?

599
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,930
It was just a gift!

600
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,876
I wanted to see a smile
on your face, that's it!

601
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,500
Then why did your
mom mention a baby?

602
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,860
Why don't you go ask her?

603
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,740
My mother doesn't
represent me, okay?

604
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,880
And till you keep obsessing
about your mother...

605
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,680
Things will never
work out between us!

606
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,540
Plan to serve lasagna,
or a divorce notice?

607
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,030
How will it work
if we both overreact?

608
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Sorry?

609
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,190
Marriage means always
having to say you're sorry.

610
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,710
I must be the world's
biggest fool in love.

611
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,230
You're the second biggest.

612
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,370
Who's Number One, then?

613
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,660
Sir. Shakuntala Ma'am
sent this for you.

614
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,050
Help, help! I'm dying of boredom.

615
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Shakuntala!

616
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,206
I've been waiting
for you for so long!

617
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,170
Who's this?

618
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,250
Dushyant!

619
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,480
Shakuntala's lover across lifetimes!

620
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,350
Yes, but only in India, okay?

621
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,940
I have different lovers
in different countries.

622
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,150
How many countries?

623
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,780
Well, my goal is 150 lovers
across 150 countries.

624
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,340
I haven't found
anyone in Iceland yet.

625
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,830
Do you know anyone there?

626
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,560
Ms. Devi, we must get going.

627
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,730
Excuse us.

628
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,940
- Good day.
- Good day, Ms. Devi.

629
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,730
150 countries. Good Lord!

630
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,890
Hello, Dushyant!

631
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,440
Paritosh Banerji. IAS. Hi.

632
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,490
So you're a Bureaucratic Superhero?

633
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,640
You have to be a superhero
when you work for the government.

634
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,360
Then prove it and rescue me
From this boring party.

635
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,270
O my darlin'

636
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:22,260
On this dreamy night

637
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,870
With the stars so bright

638
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,370
It's time to shine and dazzle

639
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,240
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

640
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,040
Why yes..

641
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,200
Let's soak in the rain

642
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,830
Whispering sweet nothings

643
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,080
Dance?

644
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,600
Let's shine and dazzle

645
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,200
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

646
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,880
Why yes...

647
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,650
Let's soak in the rain

648
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,950
Tiptoe over to me

649
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,130
Your lover's waiting eagerly

650
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,660
You know what?
I was going to cancel this trip.

651
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,250
Are you afraid of flying?

652
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,180
I hate being out of Calcutta
even for four days.

653
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,470
And I hate being in any city
for more than four days!

654
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,186
- We are doomed.
- Opposites attract!

655
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,300
Let's write upon the skies

656
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,070
This tale of yours and mine

657
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,350
How two hearts meet

658
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,130
And melt in a love so sweet, oh yes!

659
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,130
Why yes...

660
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,430
Tiptoe over to me

661
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,900
I have a confession to make.

662
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,640
My track record is sketchy.
I'm divorced.

663
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,080
Congratulations.

664
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,160
If you weren't divorced,
you wouldn't be here!

665
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,490
Why yes..

666
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,630
Let's soak in the rain

667
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,530
Whispering sweet nothings

668
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,430
Let's shine and dazzle

669
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,440
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

670
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,190
Why yes...

671
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,870
Let's soak in the rain

672
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,780
I'll miss you a lot.

673
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,440
And what if I said
you won't have to miss me?

674
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:45,650
What do you mean?

675
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,030
Let's go. I'll come along with you.

676
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:56,340
Let me see what Calcutta has,
that you are unable to leave.

677
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,810
And what if I don't
let you leave Calcutta?

678
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,780
This is the finest
house in Ballygunge.

679
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,410
This street's called Party Street.

680
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,460
In Calcutta, 'party' can also mean
political party!

681
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,180
You know, the number
of this house is 720.

682
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,590
Which is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6

683
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,570
As well as 8 x 9 x 10.

684
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,070
Poor 7 got left out.

685
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,250
Wow. And whose house is this?

686
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
Mine!

687
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
As in?

688
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,510
I bought it.

689
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,820
- When?
- Last evening.

690
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,670
Have you gone crazy?

691
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,910
I liked it, so I bought it.

692
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,030
Besides...

693
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,500
You'll be happier here than
in your dreary official residence.

694
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,410
Are you proposing to me?

695
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,780
I want a baby with an intelligent
and good-looking man, after all!

696
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,720
Never thought I'd hear
that word from your mouth.

697
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,440
Why, it's such a simple word!

698
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,380
B-A-B-Y, baby.

699
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,890
You can't settle in one place...

700
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,930
You're out to conquer
the world, and...

701
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,920
And a mother can't do that?

702
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,330
You can do anything you want.

703
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,590
So, tell me...

704
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:37,430
When do I bring the
wedding procession?

705
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,110
I asked for a baby.

706
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,240
Not a husband!

707
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:45,730
Shakuntala.

708
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,770
My parents...

709
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,850
Are against our relationship.

710
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,520
I don't care. Do you?

711
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,060
I want to meet your parents.

712
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,520
I want their blessings.

713
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,950
Take a left from ahead.

714
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
You'll cross some cows
and buffaloes on the way.

715
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,566
You'll see my mother
doing all the housework...

716
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,240
And my father will be there too...

717
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,060
Reading the newspaper
sitting on his ancient chair.

718
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,080
Won't you come along?

719
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,770
You wanted their blessings, not me.

720
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,800
Forgive them, Shakuntala.

721
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,480
Maybe love will prevail over duty?

722
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,280
I can't forgive them.

723
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,940
I had no expectations
from my father anyway.

724
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,460
Whoever was of no use
to him, didn't exist.

725
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,060
But my mother...

726
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,920
She just stood there like a statue.

727
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,100
Helpless.

728
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,360
Weak. Mute.

729
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,300
She never spoke up for herself...

730
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,250
She could have at least opened her
mouth to save her daughter from death.

731
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,190
I wanted to do this in
front of your parents, but...

732
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,430
Shakuntala, I love you very much.

733
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,130
Marry me, please?

734
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,800
Isn't the diamond a bit
small for a wedding ring?

735
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,840
It's perfect for me.

736
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,360
That's because you've become
used to settling for less.

737
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,970
After 200 calls, I thought
you called me here to say sorry.

738
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,100
I called you to know why
despite being my daughter...

739
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,820
How can marriage be
your only ambition, Anu!

740
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,640
My only ambition is
to not become like you.

741
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,610
I know how successful
and famous you are.

742
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,390
You never stop reminding me, do you?

743
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,820
At least take a look, Anu...

744
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,470
Compliments from the chef.

745
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,770
Shakuntala Maam, it's an
absolute honour to serve you.

746
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
How sweet.

747
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:41,740
When today's generation recognizes me,
I feel I've done something right.

748
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,800
And if you don't

749
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,780
she takes out her 'Black-Book'
to show you how famous she is.

750
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,580
Ignore her.

751
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Thank you.

752
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,550
- Just see it once, Anu...
- Stop it Ma.

753
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,800
I'm tired of being
on this rollercoaster!

754
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,720
I'm tired of being your daughter.

755
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,350
This is that boy speaking, not you.

756
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,010
You've lost your identity, Anu!

757
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,330
Just divorce him, I say!

758
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,140
Come home with me.

759
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,280
All my properties, shares, money...
it's all for you, isn't it?

760
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,100
I don't need you or your money.

761
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,220
Anu!

762
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,810
Actually Ma, I'm divorcing you.

763
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,930
How can anyone divorce their mother!

764
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,220
Why... Didn't you?

765
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:54,300
You'll understand
when you have a daughter.

766
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,400
Because of you,
I never want to be a mother.

767
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
That's what happens.

768
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:09,390
Sometimes when you're least
expecting it, you're expecting.

769
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,210
That's what we call
the miracle of life.

770
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,800
It's been 8 weeks. Congratulations.

771
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,470
Anu, you're going to be a mom.

772
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,180
Anu!

773
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,990
Anu!

774
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Anu!

775
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,840
Look, I won't lie.

776
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,550
Today's the happiest day of my life.

777
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,780
A child is a responsibility
of a lifetime.

778
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,680
I know.

779
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,860
Everyone handles it. We can too!

780
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,810
Not everyone can handle it, Ajay.

781
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,310
Just for once, forget all
your baggage and your parents.

782
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,930
Listen to your heart.

783
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,140
How do you feel?

784
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,650
I feel... thrilled.

785
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,380
I feel so happy that...

786
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,240
it scares me.

787
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Yes!

788
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,350
Sorry, we're having a baby.

789
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,286
If it's a girl, we'll call
her Amritha. Amrit if it's a boy.

790
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,400
You're making a scene!

791
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,870
We're making a family!

792
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,850
My baby!

793
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,100
Our baby.

794
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,450
I'm the one with
3 inch long stitches.

795
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,940
But sure, 'our baby'.

796
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,810
Okay fine, your baby.

797
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,040
What happened, Shakuntala?

798
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:22,970
Is Anu okay?

799
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,070
Yes.

800
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,030
What's the matter?

801
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,520
Paritosh, I'm not just a mother.

802
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,650
I'm still me.

803
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,270
As in?

804
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:43,960
When I recite rhymes to Anu,
my mind buzzes with numbers.

805
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,130
When she hears the rattle and claps

806
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,420
I miss the applause of my audience.

807
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,970
When I look at the verandah,
it reminds me of my stage.

808
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,970
Why aren't you on stage, then?

809
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,010
What about Anu?

810
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,280
Anu has two parents, Shakuntala.

811
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,530
You mean I can do my shows?

812
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,550
Since when did you start
asking for permission?

813
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,940
Outside India too?

814
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,910
If you lose a part of yourself

815
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,860
we'll lose a part of us, right?

816
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,570
Okay.

817
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:36,970
Okay!

818
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,860
The problem got solved so easily!

819
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,590
And I was expecting fireworks.

820
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,460
We can still have fireworks.

821
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,990
Shakuntala, you're getting late.

822
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,070
Give her to me.

823
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,730
It's time for your flight.

824
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,430
Go now.

825
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,480
When I told my manager that I wanted
to start doing my math shows again

826
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
he was shocked.

827
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,080
He said, 'But ma'am,
you've just had a baby!'

828
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,850
I said, 'Why?'

829
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,230
'Have I turned into
a different person?'

830
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,010
Do women lose their brains
after becoming mothers?

831
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:42,250
So today, shall we see if this new
mother's brain is still working or not?

832
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,250
Can I have the questions please?

833
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,460
Ms. Devi, the questions
from the audience.

834
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,770
The first question...

835
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,350
Thank you.

836
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:05,810
Thank you.

837
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,070
How are you doing it?

838
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,420
How?

839
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,970
Ma Genius: Ready
to conquer the world

840
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,670
That took 50 seconds.

841
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,390
The computer is
still calculating.

842
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,320
There it is. The computer
got it in 62 seconds.

843
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,290
She's right!

844
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,490
Ms. Devi calculated the
23rd root of a 201 digit number

845
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,120
Faster than the fastest computer,
the UNIVAC!

846
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,920
Thank you.

847
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,430
Ms. Devi, how?

848
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,000
How do you do it?

849
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,080
How!

850
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,850
Shakuntala Devi's magic spreads
across the world! What's her secret?

851
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,520
Are you ready?

852
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,950
Okay, the answer is...

853
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:29,990
Am I correct?

854
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,490
That's absolutely correct.

855
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:36,780
Thank you.

856
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,050
This is the largest mental
multiplication ever done

857
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,820
In record time by a human being!

858
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,280
I think Ms. Devi just made it to
the Guinness Book of World Records!

859
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,960
How do you do it Ms. Devi?

860
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,370
The question on everyone's mind:
How does she do it?

861
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,010
What is the cube root of

862
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,510
Correct!

863
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,150
What is the cube root of

864
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,040
So, did you find out how I do it?

865
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,600
Ms. Devi, your rather
unexceptional reaction times

866
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,420
on a battery of elementary
cognitive tasks.

867
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,930
Which were compared with the
mean RTs of adults on the same tests

868
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,010
Contrasts so markedly with your

869
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:38,150
amazing speed of performing
huge arithmetic calculations

870
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,300
as to indicate that
your skill with numbers

871
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,940
must depend largely on the
automatic encoding and retrieval

872
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,150
of a wealth of declarative and procedural
information in long term memory

873
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:51,830
rather than on any
unusual basic capacities.

874
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,300
English please.

875
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:55,990
After all the tests...

876
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:00,380
We cannot really explain
how exactly you do it, Ms. Devi.

877
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,540
How could those English
scientists know...

878
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,750
It's impossible to decipher
the great Shakuntala Devi.

879
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,350
Exactly!

880
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,940
So, what's my daughter up to?

881
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,700
Your daughter just spoke
her first word... Daddy!

882
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:22,910
Daddy...

883
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,920
Remember those musical shoes
you got her from the States?

884
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:30,990
She runs around the house in them,
chanting "Daddy, Daddy!"

885
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,930
Hello?

886
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,460
Hello.

887
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:38,710
Hello.

888
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:39,990
Hello.

889
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Hello?

890
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,210
Hello, I can't hear you.

891
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:44,860
Hello?

892
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:45,940
Hello?

893
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,490
Hello?

894
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,450
I don't understand.

895
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,310
Why can't the three of
us travel the world together?

896
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,830
I belong here, in Calcutta.

897
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,980
I thought we belonged together.

898
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,520
What will I do there?

899
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,560
You'll be busy with your shows!

900
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,630
And I'm not your stepney.

901
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,160
If you were a world
famous mathematician

902
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,200
doing shows worldwide...

903
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,000
Not just you,
the whole world would expect me

904
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,140
to pack my bags and
string along with you.

905
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,970
I've always supported
you and your career!

906
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:32,730
Thanks!

907
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,010
I've taken care of Anu
when you haven't been around!

908
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,690
Wow. You deserve a Nobel prize for
taking care of your own daughter!

909
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,800
Like you get prizes for
abandoning your daughter?

910
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:47,350
This.

911
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,420
This is what you really are!

912
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,080
You're just like all the other men!

913
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,630
What are you doing!

914
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,690
Have you gone crazy?

915
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,360
Paritosh.

916
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,510
Maths is everything to me.

917
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:42,760
But Anu's even more
important than Maths.

918
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,090
I'm sorry.
I said those things in anger.

919
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,920
If you don't want to
come with me...

920
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,810
That's your choice.

921
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,240
But Anu will stay with me now.

922
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:58,670
She'll go wherever I go.

923
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,610
She's a child, Shakuntala...

924
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,410
Not a suitcase to
be dragged city to city.

925
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,220
I can't stay without
my daughter anymore.

926
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,270
I can't stay without her either!

927
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,360
I gave birth to her.

928
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,010
I have three inch
long stitches on me.

929
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,760
I have more right on her.

930
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,760
Just giving birth doesn't
make one a mother, Shakuntala.

931
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:25,710
I'll be the world's best mother!

932
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:35,950
Shakuntala!

933
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,850
Dear Dad.

934
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,950
London is nothing like the
descriptions in storybooks.

935
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,810
There are just two
kinds of weather here.

936
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,360
Rain and winter.

937
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,600
I want to come to Calcutta.

938
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,320
I wait for your letter everyday.

939
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,810
I miss you a lot, Dad.

940
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,110
The world needs to
discover Vedic Maths.

941
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,750
Just like my daughter Anu has.

942
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:16,660
Say Hello, Anu.

943
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,790
This is Edward.

944
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,320
- Hello.
- Hi. Hello.

945
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,590
Go on, Edward. Ask her a question!

946
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,530
Oh. That won't be necessary.

947
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,030
No, I insist.

948
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,510
Ask her!

949
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,930
What's 409 square?

950
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,150
Correct!

951
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,410
How did she do that?

952
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
Tell him, sweetie.

953
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,960
So the first two digits of the
answer will be the first digit.

954
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,920
4 square, which is 16.

955
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,880
And the last two digits of the
answer will be the last digit.

956
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,100
9 square, which is 81.

957
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:56,420
And the middle two digits are two
times of the first and last number.

958
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,860
That's 2x4x9. Which is 72.

959
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,130
So the answer is 167281.

960
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,710
Very good!

961
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,790
I got a three-book deal,
only because of you.

962
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,970
Thank you!

963
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,010
Please post this to Dad.

964
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,420
What's this?

965
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,160
A letter for him.

966
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,950
Don't forget.

967
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,870
Don't forget!

968
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:26,770
Yes ma'am.

969
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,650
Shall we go to the park?

970
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,190
My mind wants to go to the park.

971
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,230
But my instinct says...

972
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,200
Sorry, Anu.

973
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:42,700
Sorry!

974
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,350
Dear Dad.

975
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,710
Apart from being a
world-famous Mathematician...

976
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:50,390
Ma's now become a
world-famous Astrologer too.

977
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:56,400
She says she has both the intellect for
Maths and the instinct for Astrology.

978
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,050
I think Ma's become very rich.

979
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:07,770
Ma says you don't have
the time to call or write to me.

980
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,740
Is that true, Dad?

981
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,660
I'll be back in three months,
you can take an appointment then.

982
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,370
Most definitely!

983
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,690
It's all Lord Ganesha's blessing!

984
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,496
I'll take your leave. Goodbye.

985
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Goodbye!

986
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:28,970
What a day, Anu.

987
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,910
25 appointments!

988
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,950
What questions did Uncle have?

989
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,310
Everyone has only two questions.

990
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,500
Will I get money? Will I get love?

991
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,160
But I have another question.

992
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
What?

993
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,970
Will I get my father?

994
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,200
I have a question too.

995
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,360
What do you think of my poster?

996
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,720
'Erase Poverty' isn't
just an empty slogan for me.

997
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,180
I've erased poverty
from my own life.

998
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,210
Please give me your precious vote...

999
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,220
I'll remove poverty
and unemployment...

1000
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,400
Dear Dad.

1001
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,930
Ma isn't just a mathematician
and astrologer now...

1002
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:11,710
She's become a politician too.

1003
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,950
Everyone says that
she's the only one

1004
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:19,050
Who can defeat Indira
Gandhi in these elections.

1005
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,710
The results will be out today.

1006
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,360
Ma... Back so soon?

1007
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,480
Anu...

1008
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,310
Turn off the TV, please.

1009
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,760
Yes, Ma.

1010
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
Here.

1011
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,370
What's this?

1012
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,590
Are the results out?

1013
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,560
Did you lose?

1014
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,380
Absolutely not.

1015
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:04,020
I never lose, Anu.

1016
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,690
Always remember that.

1017
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,500
Come on, let's pack our bags.

1018
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,150
I've booked 10 maths shows.

1019
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:29,040
10 cities. Bombay, Nagpur,
Poona, Hyderabad, Vijayawada.

1020
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,610
I need five numbers.

1021
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:32,800
Each one of you will
give me one number.

1022
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:33,880
Let's begin!

1023
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,220
Now I'm going to make a
'Magic Square' with these 5 digits.

1024
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,240
Add up any row or column
and you'll get the same answer.

1025
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,440
Want to see how?

1026
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,860
What's the answer?

1027
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,170
What's the answer?

1028
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,070
Dear Dad, I go to so
many schools with Ma.

1029
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:12,210
But I want to go to my own school.

1030
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
In one place.

1031
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,880
I don't want to travel the world.

1032
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,710
Please do something, Dad.

1033
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,790
Anu?

1034
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,770
Please?

1035
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,100
Please?

1036
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,260
Cheers!

1037
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,340
Cheers.

1038
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,120
So?

1039
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:35,870
All the way from Calcutta to Bombay.
How come?

1040
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,370
How's my daughter?

1041
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,780
She's happy.

1042
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,310
I really enjoy reading her letters.

1043
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,620
You didn't give her
any of my letters, did you?

1044
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,060
She wouldn't be able
to handle it, Paritosh.

1045
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,210
Between two continents
and two parents...

1046
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,360
She'd be torn.

1047
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
And confused.

1048
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:04,530
I've heard it many times.

1049
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,930
Shakuntala, please put her
in a proper school now.

1050
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,010
Please.

1051
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:16,340
'Proper' schools kill
creativity in children.

1052
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,910
Besides, Anu travels the world!

1053
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,350
She meets intellectuals
from various countries.

1054
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,010
It's the best kind of education.

1055
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,700
You're doing this for yourself,
not for Anu.

1056
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:29,480
You want Anu to be
with you all the time.

1057
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,880
Yes, I do. Why not?

1058
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,400
She's my daughter.

1059
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:34,890
I have every right on her.

1060
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,680
Anu's your daughter.

1061
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,200
You don't own her.

1062
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,420
Children can claim their parents
for the rest of their lives...

1063
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,720
But parents can't claim
their children forever.

1064
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,580
That's the universal rule of life.

1065
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,700
I don't believe in
such pathetic rules.

1066
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,240
You're behaving exactly
like your father.

1067
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,300
You're stealing Anu's childhood
just like he stole yours.

1068
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,370
How dare you compare me to that man!

1069
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,030
I'm nothing like him.

1070
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:21,210
Shakuntala, put Anu in a proper
school this academic year, or else...

1071
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,760
I'll have to go to
court for her custody.

1072
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,990
Not joint..

1073
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:30,470
But full custody.

1074
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:51,030
You know, for a while I felt
like we still stood a chance, but...

1075
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,320
You don't need me, Shakuntala.

1076
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,240
I don't need you, Paritosh.
I love...

1077
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,820
Loved you.

1078
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,050
I can't be a nomad like you.

1079
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:11,640
And I can't be a tree like you.

1080
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:26,550
From Shimla to the Nilgiri Hills...

1081
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,240
Here are the brochures for
India's best boarding schools.

1082
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,350
Choose.

1083
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,010
- I don't get this.
- What? This is so easy!

1084
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,710
Surprise!

1085
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,970
Hello girls!

1086
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,180
Aren't these skirts a bit too long?

1087
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,410
Get a scissor and snip them!

1088
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,390
Anu, my baby... I missed you!

1089
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,900
Come on, give me a hug!

1090
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,330
Summer holidays start in 4 days.

1091
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:09,140
I know. But I managed
to coax your principal.

1092
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:12,640
We're going to Nairobi tomorrow,
then Cape Town, Toronto, Paris...

1093
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,810
Lucky Anu!

1094
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,490
I spend summer holidays on my sofa,
in KPBB mode.

1095
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,880
What's 'KPBB'?

1096
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:21,900
'Keep Pigging-out
and Become a Buffalo!'

1097
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,830
CAJGBPQ!

1098
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,910
What's that?

1099
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,080
C'mon And Just Get
a Bag Packed Quick!

1100
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,760
Okay, bye girls!

1101
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:34,800
Dear Dad.
It's been ten years since I saw you.

1102
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,890
I want to come to Calcutta
for at least one summer holiday.

1103
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,910
- My sister Sharda...
- I'm tired of this Shakuntala Devi World Tour.

1104
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:47,130
We were so poor that we couldn't
afford to take her to a doctor.

1105
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,570
Since then, I've tried
to fulfill both our dreams.

1106
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,890
That is so inspiring. So inspiring!

1107
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,830
Now let's talk about
this book launch.

1108
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,040
Sure!

1109
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,500
You've taken on quite a
brave and controversial topic...

1110
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,260
Don't be scared to say
the title of the book loudly!

1111
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:13,250
The World of Homosexuals.

1112
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,790
I believe love is love.

1113
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:18,820
Who we choose to love
is our personal matter.

1114
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,190
Given that you aren't
homo... sexual...

1115
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,580
How did you write this book?

1116
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,190
Well I haven't killed
anyone either...

1117
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,370
But I've written a book
called 'Perfect Murder'!

1118
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:41,160
Actually I got interested
in homosexuality because...

1119
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,760
My ex-husband was a homosexual.

1120
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,380
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Are you okay?

1121
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,530
No, you should not be sorry.

1122
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,290
It is his choice and I support him.

1123
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,760
You are incredibly amazing.
So amazing!

1124
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,250
Thank you.

1125
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:05,410
Anu.

1126
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:08,430
Anu!

1127
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,980
Anu, stop!

1128
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,960
What is this behaviour, Anu!

1129
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,490
"My father was a lion-tamer,
he didn't give me food..."

1130
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,200
"He forced me to do shows..."

1131
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,060
"Poor me! Poor me!"

1132
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,090
And now you're after my Dad!

1133
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,010
How can you lie through
your teeth like this?

1134
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,230
Anu, that... Anu!

1135
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,710
Look at the larger picture!

1136
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:33,210
I want to change people's
attitudes towards homosexuality.

1137
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:37,900
Personal stories
affect people the most.

1138
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,350
If you want to sell something, you
need to weave a story around it...

1139
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:45,060
A fake story?
That too about my father?

1140
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,230
Why can't you be normal
like other moms?

1141
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:56,010
Why should I be normal
when I can be amazing?

1142
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,840
Can we go home and talk, please?

1143
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,350
Which home? Ritz or Claridges?

1144
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,300
Everyday it's a new hotel room..

1145
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,390
I don't know how
it feels to have a home.

1146
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,490
Just like I don't know
what it's like to have a mother!

1147
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:26,290
If only you loved me half
as much as you love Maths...

1148
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,470
I want to live with Dad!

1149
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,600
But your father doesn't
want to live with you.

1150
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:55,270
When he finds out about the
rumours you spread about him...

1151
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,870
Then he'll want me to stay with him!

1152
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,890
Dad! You came from Calcutta!

1153
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,150
I'm becoming a grandfather,
after all...

1154
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,230
Oh God!

1155
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,440
Easy, easy!

1156
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,210
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1157
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,280
She called you a homosexual.

1158
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:20,490
So?

1159
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:23,920
Nothing wrong with
being a homosexual, right?

1160
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,850
According to her,
your entire life is a lie.

1161
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,190
You know I don't care
about all these things.

1162
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,370
But I do!

1163
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,880
I hate that people think
you're living a double-life.

1164
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,340
If there's one thing I've
learnt from your mother...

1165
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:42,470
It's that life's too short
to care about what others think.

1166
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:45,530
If you love her so much,
why did you divorce her?

1167
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,750
To love Shakuntala is to let her be.

1168
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,590
She's like a storm.

1169
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,160
And to fight a storm is foolishness.

1170
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,490
So you got all philosophical
and stepped aside.

1171
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,110
I didn't have a choice, Anu.

1172
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,420
Ma didn't hold a gun
to your head, Dad!

1173
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,060
You chose to let me go!

1174
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,290
I don't have it in me
to fight your mother.

1175
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,810
You don't have the
courage to fight Ma...

1176
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,890
But I do!

1177
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,740
Anu!

1178
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,220
Talk to her, man.

1179
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,630
Uncle it's okay,
you know how she is...

1180
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,860
My water broke!

1181
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:17,940
What?

1182
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,760
Anu!

1183
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,000
Call the doctor now!

1184
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,600
Ma!

1185
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,870
House number 689.

1186
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,440
Guess why this number is special?

1187
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:35,020
All numbers are special to you, Ma.

1188
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:41,250
Because 689 remains 689,
even upside down.

1189
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,010
Fascinating.

1190
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,500
Angry young woman!

1191
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:49,520
You know, Hyde Park
is just 5 minutes from here!

1192
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:53,380
Great. People living here
can go there for a walk everyday.

1193
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:58,570
I've bought this house
for both of us, Anu.

1194
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,650
Let's do lazy Sundays.

1195
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,980
Let's do 'KPBB'!

1196
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,050
What about your Math shows?

1197
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,320
I'm taking a break for a while.

1198
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,190
I want to be your full-time mom.

1199
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,860
And you can speak to your Dad too,
if you like.

1200
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,380
No!

1201
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,490
Okay, give me the keys!

1202
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,450
Give me the keys!

1203
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,690
Here, here!

1204
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:37,270
Ma, three floors!

1205
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:38,350
Happy?

1206
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,110
Ma, can I redecorate
this house on my own?

1207
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,480
You're just 16!

1208
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,520
You haven't studied or
trained in interior design.

1209
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,880
How will you do it, Anu?

1210
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,900
Did you ever do a Maths course?

1211
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,590
Correct.

1212
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,170
Please, Ma?

1213
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,610
I've admired other people's homes
since I was a kid.

1214
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,030
I want to build my own home.

1215
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,700
Okay, let's build our home then!

1216
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:11,750
Let me capture you

1217
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,970
Right here in my smile

1218
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:18,770
Lest I lose you again

1219
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,630
O my prized one

1220
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:24,990
Let me hide you

1221
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:29,320
Away from prying eyes

1222
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:36,020
Like a reflection,
I emerged from you

1223
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:39,820
Why can't I be all you need?

1224
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:45,210
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

1225
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:50,850
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

1226
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:56,400
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

1227
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,870
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

1228
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,250
Look, Anu.
There's a pattern in these branches.

1229
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:13,230
So that every leaf
gets its share of sunlight.

1230
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,870
Snowflakes have
similar patterns too.

1231
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,400
Nature's the greatest mathematician.

1232
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,400
Ma... No!

1233
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,130
Sorry, sorry...

1234
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:26,880
No maths.

1235
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:36,230
Sometimes my very own

1236
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,910
Sometimes a stranger unknown

1237
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:43,320
You leave me so perplexed

1238
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:49,880
If only for a moment,
I could banish this world

1239
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:54,740
All my heart wants
Is to feel your caresses

1240
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:57,410
As you untangle my tresses

1241
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:00,320
Until I drift to sleep

1242
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,330
Where else would you want to be?

1243
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:09,990
Don't leave me alone
To stumble and fall

1244
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:15,440
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

1245
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,970
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

1246
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:26,510
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

1247
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,670
Why are you dragging me, Anu?

1248
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,980
- We just bought a house!
- Ma, ma...

1249
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,740
This house was built in 1858.

1250
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,010
I want to buy and
refurbish it completely.

1251
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,830
And then we'll rent it out.

1252
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:48,390
The profits from rent can go
into buying the next property...

1253
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,976
The rent will increase every year
and we'll easily recover the cost.

1254
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,610
And we'll add to our properties too.

1255
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,700
In whose name shall
I make the cheque?

1256
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:00,160
Ma, it's a huge amount.

1257
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,060
400,000 pounds.

1258
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,670
No amount is too much to
see this twinkle in your eyes!

1259
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:16,780
When did my little baby grow so big?

1260
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,140
No...

1261
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:25,690
Sleep, sleep...

1262
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:33,140
Aw, baby...

1263
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:38,390
Hush, hush...

1264
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,030
Anu...

1265
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,930
What happened, sweetheart?

1266
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,150
I can't even put
my daughter to sleep!

1267
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,530
It's your first baby!

1268
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,360
Give yourself some time.

1269
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,500
It's been so long.

1270
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,430
Maybe I just don't
have that instinct.

1271
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,440
I'm a really bad mother.

1272
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,500
Can I tell you a secret?

1273
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,880
Every mother is a 'bad mother'.

1274
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,650
If she loves her kids too much,
she spoils them.

1275
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,970
If she doesn't love them enough,
she still spoils them.

1276
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,290
The perfect mother doesn't exist!

1277
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,380
Something serious...

1278
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,460
My girl!

1279
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,820
Were you two gossiping about me?

1280
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,180
You're not that important.

1281
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,730
I was just telling Anu...

1282
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,930
That however she is,
she's a perfect mother.

1283
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,730
That's right.

1284
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,970
The first time I saw her...

1285
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,870
I knew she'd be the perfect mother.

1286
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,710
When you first met me, you
thought I had the perfect mother.

1287
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:08,790
And that!

1288
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,230
They said, "How do you do it?"

1289
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,910
"Ms. Devi!"

1290
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,920
Hello.

1291
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,300
Hello, ma'am.

1292
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,380
Hello.

1293
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,060
How do you do it?

1294
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,176
So many Hellos.
Not letting me finish the story...

1295
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,170
Good evening, Shakuntala Devi Ma'am!

1296
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:27,650
Big fan.

1297
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:29,740
I'm Ajay Abhaya Kumar.

1298
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:31,110
Nice to meet you.

1299
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:34,350
By the way, did you want
to meet me or my daughter?

1300
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,020
Well I'd have to impress you
first to stand a chance with her!

1301
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,960
We go back a long way.

1302
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:41,390
- Really?
- Yes.

1303
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:46,470
When I was little, my Dad took
me on his scooter every Sunday

1304
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,950
to meet my grandparents.

1305
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,710
And did I know your grandparents?

1306
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:50,920
No, hear me out.

1307
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,516
- That house of yours in Bangalore...
- Yes.

1308
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,620
It used to come en route.

1309
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:57,270
Whenever we crossed it,
Dad would say:

1310
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,590
"Do you know who lives here?"

1311
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:00,140
"The great Shakuntala Devi!"

1312
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:01,750
He would tell me:

1313
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,610
"Shakuntala Devi is from Bangalore."

1314
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:04,870
"And so are you."

1315
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:09,190
"The only difference is, she's always
out of the country thanks to Maths..."

1316
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,750
"And you're always out of class!"

1317
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,660
So? Did your Maths improve?

1318
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,910
No.

1319
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:20,310
I thought, India's already produced
this century's biggest Math Genius...

1320
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,890
Why should I even bother?

1321
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:24,550
Ajay Abhaya Kumar...

1322
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:25,990
I have an instinct.

1323
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:28,190
Your destiny's about to change.

1324
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,830
You're going to hit the jackpot!

1325
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:30,910
Thank you, ma'am.

1326
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:35,410
Since an astrologer like you is
saying it, I accept my fate humbly.

1327
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,110
Maybe I should buy a
lottery ticket on my way back?

1328
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,590
Your glasses are empty.

1329
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,190
Please allow me to refill them.

1330
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:46,510
Good idea!

1331
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,600
Thank you.

1332
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,680
No problem!

1333
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:57,100
Ajay Abhay Kumar...

1334
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,190
I should find out more about him.

1335
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,920
Why? Plan on marrying him?

1336
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,230
Yes. To you!

1337
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,960
My instinct says, this boy will be
my son-in-law some day.

1338
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:09,210
No, no, no!

1339
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:14,210
Ajay comes from
a very normal family.

1340
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:16,690
So I need all of
us to act normal too.

1341
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,890
We promise you, Anu.

1342
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,940
We'll be so normal that
they won't even notice us.

1343
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,840
They'll be amazed
at how normal we are.

1344
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,040
I really love Ajay.

1345
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:32,670
When I'm with him, I feel complete.

1346
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,530
Like I've found my soulmate.

1347
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,780
Please don't mess this up today.

1348
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,310
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1349
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:43,450
And even if it isn't,
just have a baby with Ajay...

1350
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,770
Because he's so intelligent
and good looking!

1351
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:47,780
Shakuntala!

1352
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,030
Ma! Is this your idea of normal?

1353
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,440
Anu is a really normal girl!

1354
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,140
She was very normal at studies.

1355
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:09,880
Her career is super normal too!

1356
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,860
You must try her cakes someday.
They're deliciously normal!

1357
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,130
Correct!

1358
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,890
Saying 'normal' every few seconds isn't
really normal behaviour, you know...

1359
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,120
The weather's so hot, right?

1360
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,100
What's the cricket match score?

1361
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,960
There's no cricket match today.

1362
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,980
Your saree looks so pretty!

1363
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,320
So much corruption
these days, right?

1364
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,900
- Very bad...
- Very bad.

1365
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,930
Why are we discussing all this...

1366
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,820
Isn't that what normal people
talk about?

1367
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:53,020
Thank God you aren't normal.

1368
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,380
Where else would we find
such entertaining in-laws!

1369
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:02,860
Have some sweets.
I made them myself.

1370
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,120
Really?

1371
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,660
I ordered them from
Sri Krishna Sweets.

1372
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,070
I was also just
pretending to be normal!

1373
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:23,350
I can't breathe...

1374
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:25,310
But you look classy!

1375
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:28,030
Come come...

1376
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,330
There are lots of options!

1377
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,370
Aunty, I don't really
wear formals...

1378
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,730
This will look good on you!

1379
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:34,720
Pandy!

1380
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,300
Ma'am.

1381
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,380
Look.

1382
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,730
Now he looks like
Shakuntala Devi's son-in-law!

1383
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:40,810
Correct!

1384
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:42,890
Pandy, here is my credit card.

1385
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,050
We're going to shop a lot.

1386
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,260
Aunty, please don't.
Please return the card.

1387
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,610
No... Why?

1388
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:48,880
Please return the card.

1389
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,850
Pandy!

1390
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:50,930
Sorry, Sir.

1391
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,430
- Ajay!
- Aunty what are you doing!

1392
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:53,160
Please don't...

1393
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,950
It's a gift from me, keep it!

1394
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,490
I've never told you,
but I'm very rich.

1395
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:00,730
I just pretend to be middle-class!

1396
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:03,050
But Aunty, I really am middle-class.

1397
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:06,640
Well, once you move to
London with me after marriage...

1398
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,660
You won't remain
middle-class anymore.

1399
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,730
And I will take your
business to new heights.

1400
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,930
Wait and watch!

1401
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,180
But I'm not shifting to London.

1402
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:19,330
Oh! But long distance
marriage is really difficult.

1403
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:20,500
Take it from me!

1404
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,740
But Anu's moving
to Bangalore, right?

1405
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,870
Anu's life is in London with me.

1406
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,690
But she'll be with
me after marriage.

1407
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,170
I can't live without Anu.

1408
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:33,990
But it's normal, Aunty.

1409
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:36,520
You can't jail your
daughter like this.

1410
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,050
'Normal'?

1411
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:40,660
When a boy's mother expects

1412
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:43,440
her daughter-in-law to
live with her, it's 'normal'.

1413
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,040
But if a girl's mother expects

1414
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,130
her son-in-law to live with her,
she's jailing her?

1415
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:50,640
What logic is that, I say!

1416
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,280
- Aunty I'm sorry, I didn't mean that...
- What did you mean?

1417
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,210
Anu won't live with
you or my parents.

1418
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,300
We've decided to live in
our own house after marriage.

1419
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,190
Anu will never leave
me and go to Bangalore.

1420
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:07,540
Why don't you ask her once...

1421
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:08,970
What she really wants?

1422
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,560
Aunty, she loves me...

1423
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:14,240
And I love her more than anything!

1424
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,380
Anyone.

1425
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:19,350
You love her more than anyone?

1426
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,600
What have you done for her?

1427
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,730
Have you got this?

1428
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:31,410
You're not the world's
only mother to have a C-section!

1429
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,790
He wants to snatch
you away from me, Anu!

1430
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:37,630
Moving with him is my own decision!

1431
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:42,510
But I've planned our
whole life ahead, Anu!

1432
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:44,930
And who gave you the
right to plan my life?

1433
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,830
I have dreams of my own too!

1434
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,650
And what about my dreams?

1435
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:53,700
You made me give up
my shows, astrology...

1436
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,080
I gave up Maths for you!

1437
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:59,110
I lost everything
so I could have you, Anu!

1438
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,370
I'm so sorry!

1439
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:04,300
You deserve the Nobel prize
for looking after your daughter!

1440
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,630
Sorry. Sorry Anu.

1441
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:17,830
Anu...

1442
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,250
So...

1443
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,000
What about your business in London?

1444
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:32,250
I can run it from here.

1445
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,770
If you leave me for that boy...

1446
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:42,240
You can say goodbye
to your business too.

1447
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,320
You already separated me from Dad...

1448
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:55,700
I won't let you
take my love away now!

1449
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,370
And if that means
losing the business

1450
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:01,310
I built with my own hard work...

1451
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:02,390
So be it!

1452
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:09,100
That fellow is feeding you rubbish,
I'm telling you Anu!

1453
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,970
What are you doing?

1454
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:12,160
Anu, just listen to...

1455
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,150
What are you doing?

1456
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,740
Anu. Anu!

1457
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,270
Where are you going?

1458
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:18,350
Anu!

1459
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:19,770
Anu, let's...

1460
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,240
Anu!

1461
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,050
Anu!

1462
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,910
You are right Shakuntala, but...

1463
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,100
Yes, but...

1464
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:42,670
That's true, but...

1465
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,220
Right.

1466
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,560
Come what may...

1467
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,020
I'm going to marry Ajay.

1468
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,930
Now you decide, Dad...

1469
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,050
If you're on my side...

1470
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,260
Or Ma's.

1471
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,120
This is Anu Banerji.

1472
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,160
I'm sorry I can't take your call
right now, please leave your number-

1473
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,670
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1474
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:01,460
Welcome to The Mohan Manhas Show!

1475
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:05,020
Where we crack jokes
with famous folks!

1476
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:09,370
Our special guest today calls
herself the 'Human Computer'.

1477
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:12,270
I call myself Shakuntala.

1478
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,820
People call me the Human Computer.

1479
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,080
So Ms. Devi, we hear you're
doing very few shows of late...

1480
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,900
Planning to retire?

1481
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:23,900
Why would I retire...

1482
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,640
When I can set a stage on fire!

1483
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:32,020
Ooh! Your sense of
humour is surely intact!

1484
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,220
So tell us...

1485
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,480
Have your Maths skills
reduced with age?

1486
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,080
Age is just a number.
And numbers love me!

1487
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,900
And may I ask... How old are you?

1488
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,160
- If you don't mind...
- No, no I don't mind.

1489
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:52,310
I'm a day older than yesterday...

1490
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,200
And a day younger than tomorrow.

1491
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,410
Now you do the Math!

1492
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,780
Well played, well played!

1493
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:01,930
Okay then, let's keep playing.

1494
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:05,350
We also have some
Math problems for you.

1495
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:09,520
I thought this was just a talk show.

1496
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:12,260
Wherever you go,
Maths follows. Right?

1497
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:14,350
Starting easy.

1498
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:16,980
What's the cube of 121.

1499
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:24,560
1761561.

1500
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:35,260
Sorry, I meant 1771561

1501
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,700
which is also the 4th power of 11.

1502
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:42,760
Ms. Devi, if my
calculations are right...

1503
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,410
I think you mean
the sixth power of 11?

1504
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:47,620
You are correct.

1505
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:50,410
You're in the Guinness
Book of World Records...

1506
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,990
So our next question should
be a piece of cake for you...

1507
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:55,470
On your screen!

1508
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,320
Ms. Devi?

1509
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:26,120
I'm sorry... My head hurts.

1510
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:31,960
I haven't slept well
the last few nights...

1511
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,070
Can I get a two minute break please?

1512
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,630
Of course.

1513
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:39,950
Looks like the 'Human computer'
finally crashed today!

1514
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,700
Don't go anywhere.

1515
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:45,140
We'll be right back after a short break
with The Mohan Manhas Show!

1516
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,930
Stop here.
The car can't go any further.

1517
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:29,880
Shakuntala, you need to practice.

1518
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,550
You're booked for
ten shows next week.

1519
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,490
What goes around comes around.

1520
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,910
Wait till your daughter
gives you a hard time!

1521
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,000
You'll be a big man someday.

1522
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,690
Why would I be a man?

1523
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:48,620
Because there's no such
thing as a 'big woman'!

1524
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:52,230
In that case,
I'll definitely be a big woman.

1525
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,720
- God-promise?
- God-promise.

1526
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:53,360
Amma, I'm talking to you!
Have you lost your voice?

1527
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,180
Why can't you speak
up in front of him?

1528
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:01,810
Amma!

1529
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:52,540
Hello.

1530
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:54,390
Vasanti?

1531
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,420
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1532
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,560
- Hi! Thanks a lot for coming.
- Thank you.

1533
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,100
Hello. Thanks for coming.

1534
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,740
Let me know what
you think of the house.

1535
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:20,630
Hi! Please see all the rooms
and tell me what you think.

1536
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:21,860
Thank you so much.

1537
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,090
- Hi!
- Anu!

1538
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:26,490
It's been so long.

1539
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:27,460
Congratulations!

1540
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:30,290
Thank you so much!
It's a dream come true.

1541
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,770
I've refurbished four houses.
I hope we find good buyers now.

1542
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:33,960
We've invested a lot!

1543
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,390
- We were congratulating you about Amritha!
- Exactly!

1544
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:37,770
Thank you.

1545
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:40,080
- She's also a dream come true for me.
- 'Also'?

1546
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:43,130
Anu, you're a mother now.
You should just have one dream now.

1547
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,250
Exactly. But where is she?

1548
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:46,130
We still haven't met her.
How old is she now?

1549
01:42:46,210 --> 01:42:47,430
She's very young right now.

1550
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:49,300
And I was so busy with work, that...

1551
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,380
Busy, really?

1552
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,060
This is the time for
you to enjoy her childhood.

1553
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,800
These days won't ever come back!

1554
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,870
You know Anu, I took a maternity
break from my job for my first baby.

1555
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,290
And before I knew it,
I had another child.

1556
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:03,746
Then I thought, 'Let it go.
I can always pick up a job later.'

1557
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:04,790
My children needed me.

1558
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:06,730
And I don't think
of this as sacrifice.

1559
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,420
It's my duty!

1560
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:12,350
Absolutely, it's never a sacrifice.

1561
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,500
Please eat something.

1562
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,940
I'll just go check on things.

1563
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,910
- Hey, nice house!
- Thanks.

1564
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:26,090
Anu. You killed it!

1565
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:28,200
Everyone's full of praise for you.

1566
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,720
- I'm going home.
- Why?

1567
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,790
We're both here,
and Amritha's there alone...

1568
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:33,050
It's okay! Her nanny's there.

1569
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:34,480
But her mom isn't.

1570
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,060
I'm leaving, you handle the rest.

1571
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:37,130
Listen!

1572
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:39,310
- Excuse me.
- Yeah sure.

1573
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:44,420
Anu.

1574
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:46,180
She's fast asleep.

1575
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,090
I need to talk to you.

1576
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:50,510
I need to tell you something first.

1577
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,940
Okay.

1578
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,120
You know, Ajay...

1579
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,960
Maybe I was too harsh on Ma.

1580
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,290
She calls me everyday
and I've never answered.

1581
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:10,290
I've decided...

1582
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:12,990
I'm going to call Ma
and tell her about Amritha.

1583
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,110
First see what she's done.

1584
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:32,370
Your mother has used her power of
attorney and sold all your properties.

1585
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,700
My business properties in London?

1586
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,100
Yes.

1587
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:40,770
And what about my profit share?

1588
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,040
Zero. Nothing.

1589
01:44:42,210 --> 01:44:43,210
Absolutely zilch.

1590
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:46,430
In fact the capital gains tax
liability is completely on your name.

1591
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:48,250
Which means you will have to pay it.

1592
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,490
We'll have to pay it.

1593
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,820
How much?

1594
01:44:57,910 --> 01:45:00,890
So much that even if we sell
our house and both our businesses...

1595
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:03,390
We still won't be
able to pay it off, Anu.

1596
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:06,080
Your mother has finished us.

1597
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,460
We're finished!

1598
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:12,990
Now what?

1599
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:14,900
We have two options.

1600
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:19,360
Either we sell everything we have,
borrow money from friends...

1601
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:23,860
Take a bank loan and
get rid of this liability.

1602
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,690
I'll take the other option.

1603
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:33,650
The other option is legal.

1604
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,000
We'll have to go to London and file
a court case against your mother.

1605
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:39,090
A criminal case.

1606
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:41,310
She could go to jail.

1607
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:44,060
She wanted to fight.

1608
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:45,970
Now she'll have to fight a war.

1609
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,090
You need to be strong and brutal.

1610
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:56,320
Don't get carried
away by any emotions.

1611
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:57,650
We will win this.

1612
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:01,130
Yes. Yes, we will.

1613
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:04,990
Hello everyone.

1614
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:15,740
Ms. Banerji, If you could
take a seat, please?

1615
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,250
Anu.

1616
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,550
Let's begin.

1617
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,990
My client Ms. Anupama
Banerji would like to...

1618
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:40,750
press criminal charges
against her mother...

1619
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:43,406
for unlawfully selling her properties
that were in both their names...

1620
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,910
and sending the tax bill
to an unsuspecting Ms. Banerji.

1621
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:49,760
My client Shakuntala Devi
vehemently denies this charge.

1622
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:53,680
It was her money that Anupama
Banerji used to build this business.

1623
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:56,200
And Ms. Banerji did
not repay a penny of it.

1624
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,800
So this justifies
the tax bill completely.

1625
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:01,480
Shakuntala Devi
is an unfit mother...

1626
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,020
who chased her ambitions at the
cost of raising her own daughter.

1627
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:06,460
That's a false accusation.

1628
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,820
Did she not take
Anu out of the country?

1629
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:12,990
Did you not stop her from
going to school with other children?

1630
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:16,210
She took her out of the country
from show to show, hotel to hotel...

1631
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:17,990
Depriving her of any childhood.

1632
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:20,610
Did she not keep Anu away
from her father for ten years?

1633
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:22,170
Ten years!

1634
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:26,210
And not even one letter was passed
on from her beloved father...

1635
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:30,720
And did she not accuse her
father of being a homosexual...

1636
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,160
At a public gathering!

1637
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:33,450
Correct.

1638
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,660
I'm sorry...

1639
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,170
What?

1640
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:44,110
I accept all your accusations.

1641
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:48,840
Your lawyer is absolutely right.

1642
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,960
I'm a terrible mother.

1643
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:07,820
We made a profit of one million, one
thousand and one pounds exactly...

1644
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,860
After selling the
properties, correct?

1645
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,130
Yes, that's right.

1646
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,050
What a beautiful number.

1647
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,900
It's called a palindrome.

1648
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:23,630
Meaning, it reads the
same frontwards and backwards.

1649
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,320
I want to sign a cheque and give my
daughter the entire amount right now.

1650
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:41,170
Ms. Devi, that's preposterous.

1651
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:45,450
Anu if you want to press criminal
charges and send me to jail...

1652
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:51,870
God-promise,
I'm ready to go to jail.

1653
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:56,990
Ms. Devi, you can't just
lose this case like this.

1654
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:01,370
I never lose, Mr Stevens...

1655
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,530
I always win.

1656
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:09,940
I just wanted to see
you once anyhow, Anu.

1657
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
I've seen you now.

1658
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:15,500
That's enough.

1659
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:20,410
Who does all this
for such a small thing?

1660
01:49:21,730 --> 01:49:23,190
My Drama-Queen mother!

1661
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:29,540
Do you have any idea
of the impact of your actions?

1662
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,380
Don't you ever get tired?

1663
01:49:32,590 --> 01:49:38,710
Anu, I spent my...

1664
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:43,110
entire life hating my mother...

1665
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:48,510
I didn't want you
to hate me like that...

1666
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,430
Anu...

1667
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,820
Anu!

1668
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:59,090
Ms. Devi, please.
We have to talk through this.

1669
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:00,670
Can we step out?

1670
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,100
Yes that would be a good idea.

1671
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:04,720
Let's all take a small break.

1672
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:11,280
I need to be alone.

1673
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,560
Okay. I'll be right outside
if you need me, okay?

1674
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,080
Ajay!

1675
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,460
Ajay!

1676
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:30,590
You okay?

1677
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:35,300
I always used to ridicule
her Black-Book...

1678
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:39,210
But see...
She actually made one for me!

1679
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:44,320
This is me with the Prime
Minister of Mauritius...

1680
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,710
With the President of Kenya...

1681
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,540
This is in Canada...

1682
01:51:48,970 --> 01:51:52,030
And look, that's me
with Amitabh Bachchan!

1683
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:57,270
Whenever Ma met a film star,
she'd tell them-

1684
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,330
"My daughter's your biggest fan!"

1685
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:02,890
And then they would go-

1686
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:05,740
"Really?
Which one's your favourite film?"

1687
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,950
And I would just freeze.

1688
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,190
I had no clue who they were.

1689
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:13,190
And Ma would burst out laughing!

1690
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:27,870
I always thought I had
such a terrible childhood...

1691
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:31,770
Then why am I smiling
in all these pictures?

1692
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:42,400
I always thought
you and I are one team.

1693
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:45,460
That we belong to each other.

1694
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:49,690
But when I saw the two
of you together today...

1695
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,310
I realised...

1696
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:55,470
Your team has changed, Anu.

1697
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:00,130
I can't fight with you anymore, Ma.

1698
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:05,170
Anu, I'm sorry.

1699
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:08,650
I couldn't be the mother you wanted.

1700
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,460
I wasn't exactly
a model daughter either!

1701
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,530
You had to quit Maths because of me.

1702
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:16,050
When you left,
Maths left me too, Anu...

1703
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:18,670
I'm sorry, Ma...

1704
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:22,320
I always saw you as a mother.

1705
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:24,250
Never as a woman.

1706
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:29,710
Now that I have my own daughter,
I understand...

1707
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:32,260
What? Am I already
old enough to be a grandma?

1708
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:33,900
Are you happy or sad!

1709
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,660
I've never been happier
in my whole life!

1710
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,800
My baby.

1711
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,490
Mothers and daughters...

1712
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,160
What a waste of a day!

1713
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:57,440
Mothers and daughters!

1714
01:53:59,430 --> 01:54:00,610
Mothers and daughters...

1715
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:05,680
Amritha!

1716
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:09,160
How could you name her
Amritha without asking me?

1717
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:11,750
It's okay, gentlemen.

1718
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,520
But my instinct says...

1719
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:17,470
You'll have another daughter,
and she'll be called Nayana!

1720
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,200
Excuse me.

1721
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,610
I'll be outside.

1722
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:23,690
Take your time.

1723
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:29,870
By the way,
Ajay's not so bad after all.

1724
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,380
Thanks Ma!

1725
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,340
He reminds me of Paritosh.

1726
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:42,570
But living in one city,
with one man, forever...

1727
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:43,890
What kind of life is that?

1728
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:45,920
Don't say 'normal'!

1729
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:05,570
The genius...
Guinness Book record-holding

1730
01:55:05,650 --> 01:55:07,420
world-famous Mathematician...

1731
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,080
The Human Computer!

1732
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:12,590
Shakuntala Devi Ma'am,
it is my absolute honour...

1733
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:15,910
to give away the prestigious Mathematics
Lifetime Achievement Award to you.

1734
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:22,550
Oh please!

1735
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:25,260
I am younger than you in mind!

1736
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:31,240
Shakuntala Ma'am, we can't let you
go without saying a couple of words.

1737
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,620
A couple?

1738
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:37,090
'Thank you.' Can I leave now?

1739
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,840
Please, no.

1740
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:43,790
- Can you keep it there please?
- Yes.

1741
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,920
Thank you.

1742
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:51,120
Zero is my favorite number.

1743
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:54,540
Maybe because this world is round?

1744
01:55:56,730 --> 01:56:00,430
Sometimes life teaches us lessons...

1745
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,570
By making us spin in circles!

1746
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:12,200
Today, I want to say something...

1747
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:18,090
That I haven't even
said to myself before.

1748
01:56:21,110 --> 01:56:26,240
All my life,
I was angry with my mother.

1749
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:31,040
And I didn't realize
when anger turned into hate.

1750
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:38,440
I was angry that she never
spoke up in front of my father.

1751
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:42,340
Because she didn't
have a voice of her own.

1752
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:47,030
Maybe that's why today...

1753
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:50,050
...I have my own voice.

1754
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:56,810
It was only when my daughter
explained it to me, that I realised...

1755
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:02,290
I always saw my mother
just as a mother...

1756
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:07,120
And never as a woman.

1757
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,850
I never understood her.

1758
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:13,720
My only ambition in life...

1759
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:18,430
Was to not become like my mother.

1760
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:25,200
And so perhaps
everything I am today...

1761
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,670
Is because of her.

1762
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:31,990
Ma!

1763
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,350
I'm proud of you!

1764
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:41,780
I am also who I am

1765
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:44,480
because of my daughter.

1766
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:51,180
My darling Anu, who is whistling
from the audience for me.

1767
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:57,400
Her whistles and the pride
I see in her eyes today...

1768
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,590
Is my biggest award.

1769
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:11,570
Every mom hopes that her daughter
won't just see her as a mother...

1770
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:16,290
But also as a genius sometimes.

1771
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:27,480
Okay, I've rambled on enough...

1772
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:29,640
Shall we do some Maths?

1773
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,030
Yes...

1774
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:33,730
Is everyone low on energy?

1775
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,210
I can't hear you yet!

1776
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:37,000
Yes!

1777
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:43,120
Okay so today, I am going to introduce
you to 'Miss Revolving Number'.

1778
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:47,140
She's very special.

1779
01:58:47,570 --> 01:58:48,670
I'll tell you why!

1780
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:51,550
142857...

1781
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,180
That's my mother.

1782
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:12,390
My amazing mother!

1783
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:21,830
Our relationship wasn't
built on reverence or sacrifice.

1784
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:30,650
She wasn't the typical mom
who exists in books and films...

1785
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:37,220
Because my mother knew
how to live for herself.

1786
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,960
She knew how to value herself.

1787
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,200
She knew how to embrace
life wholeheartedly.

1788
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:02,090
Everyday, I strive to
be a little like her.

1789
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,960
God-promise.

1790
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:49,980
BODMAS.

1791
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:53,080
B for Bracket.

1792
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,270
O for Order.

1793
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:59,520
D for Division.

1794
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,400
M for Multiplication.

1795
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,530
A for Addition.

1796
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:08,570
S for Subtraction.

1797
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:23,000
Two chickens each for you and me

1798
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,040
Make four chickens in all

1799
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:27,830
Seven notes on the count of three

1800
02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:29,910
Put the melody in a song

1801
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:32,580
Numbers make the world go round

1802
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:35,000
Step out of the box and see

1803
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,370
Why become a bookworm...

1804
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:39,160
Set your mind free

1805
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:40,040
Sing with me

1806
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,250
1,2,3,4...

1807
02:03:42,330 --> 02:03:49,250
There's no pass, there's no fail

1808
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:50,950
Be fearless, all is well

1809
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:51,950
Sing with me!

1810
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,250
There's no pass, there's no fail

1811
02:03:54,330 --> 02:03:56,370
It's a classroom not a jail

1812
02:03:56,450 --> 02:03:58,790
There's no pass, there's no fail

1813
02:03:58,870 --> 02:04:01,160
Set your mind free

1814
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:10,500
Be fearless and sing with me

1815
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:11,580
Sing with me!

1816
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:20,400
Be fearless and sing with me

1817
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:32,590
It's easier than it seems

1818
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:34,970
No reason to lose your mind

1819
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:37,390
Just take on what it brings

1820
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:39,640
Kick your fears behind

1821
02:04:39,970 --> 02:04:42,340
Why let books weigh you down

1822
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:44,470
It's time to let them go

1823
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,970
You're light as a whiff of air

1824
02:04:47,050 --> 02:04:48,890
So take flight and soar!

1825
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:51,760
Sing with me 1,2,3,4...

1826
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:58,760
There's no pass, there's no fail

1827
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:00,800
Be fearless, all is well

1828
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:01,720
Sing with me!

1829
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,640
There's no pass, there's no fail

1830
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:06,000
It's a classroom not a jail

1831
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:08,350
There's no pass, there's no fail

1832
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:11,060
Set your mind free

1833
02:05:17,990 --> 02:05:20,100
Be fearless, all is well

1834
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,520
Sing with me!

1835
02:05:21,544 --> 02:05:24,544
