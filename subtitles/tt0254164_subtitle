3
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,834
- Is Mrs Laxmi Chaudhary in?
- Yes.

4
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:31,392
Sister, someone has
come to meet you.

5
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,544
- Do come in and sit down.
- Our duty is to keep standing, Madam.

6
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:41,863
- Yes? What is it?
- We're from the Income Tax.

7
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:44,828
Your husband has been raided.
Let's go immediately.

8
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,563
- My God! What do I do now?
- Don't worry, sister.

9
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:50,368
They're only Income Tax officers,
they won't harm you.

10
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,031
I'll accompany you.
Let's go.

11
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:09,918
- Where's your master?
- He's inside.

12
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:25,368
We are doomed, Saraswati!
We are ruined!

13
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,056
What do I do now?

14
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:35,625
How often...

15
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:42,435
have I asked you not to hide the keys
of the locker behind God's picture?!

16
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,823
We've been raided now, haven't we?!
They'll take all away now!

17
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:49,512
The gold, the cash...
and this house!

18
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:52,116
No! Not the house!

19
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:55,010
They'll take away
everything. Everything!

20
00:02:55,212 --> 00:03:00,447
No! Please save this house!
I beg of you!

21
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,835
Please don't render us homeless.

22
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:07,420
Very well. Since today is our
25th wedding anniversary...

23
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,649
I can't refuse you anything.

24
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,518
I will do then, that which...

25
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,747
every sensible husband does!

26
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,461
Here's the 100 Rupees...
Get going.

27
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,173
Only a hundred rupees, sir?

28
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:30,632
Now look; I was born after
the death of a 1000 misers!

29
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:33,167
Quietly take this...
or you get nothing!

30
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:35,832
I'll even call the cops
and tell them that...

31
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:40,310
some guys from the films posed
as policemen and kidnapped my wife!

32
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,696
We've done just as you
asked us to, sir.

33
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,004
But we get more money
to speak our lines!

34
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,511
You ought to be
large-hearted today...

35
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:49,907
let's the silver jubilee
of your wedding, after all!

36
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,593
Here's 10 more rupees...
and just get lost!

37
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:56,713
Thank you.

38
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:01,339
Weren't they from the Income
Tax, brother-in-law?

39
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,075
You were conned, weren't you?

40
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,466
Where was the need
to do all that?

41
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:10,900
When a wife goes away to
her parents' place on...

42
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:15,611
her 25th wedding anniversary,
what does a man do?

43
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:19,663
Your practical jokes will
ruin this home someday!

44
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:24,078
There's a limit! What if I had
suffered a heart-attack?

45
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,781
A heart-attack? Do you
have the heart, then?

46
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:31,635
Hadn't you given it away to me
25 years ago on our nuptial night?

47
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:34,248
Hush! Can't you see your
sister-in-law here?!

48
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:36,605
You're scaring me as if
she were a gun!

49
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:39,111
She's only a sister-in-law...
a half-wife!

50
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,833
Now wait...

51
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:52,027
- Here you are!
- Wow! It's beautiful!

52
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,927
- Is this for me?
- Of course!

53
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:59,227
Looks like you will always
play jokes and buy gold!

54
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,163
I might get over the
habit of playing jokes.

55
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,113
But to admire the beauty of
the girls from the villages...

56
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,550
who are no less than
real gold...

57
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,943
I will never get over
my admiration for them.

58
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:21,805
Congratulations on your
wedding anniversary!

59
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:26,610
See how much your son loves
you both, brother-in-law?

60
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,466
He's bound you both
in just one garland!

61
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,549
It's Amit who will be bound
in matrimony now.

62
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:35,688
That's the gift I give you
on my anniversary, my son!

63
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,279
There you go again!
Now yet, daddy!

64
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:40,560
You know marriage is going
to cost me dearly.

65
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,269
I've got to go to London for
my business-management course!

66
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,413
I've got to begin my career!
You know that, don't you?

67
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,589
There's no career bigger than
finding a good wife!

68
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:49,999
Look at your Mom...

69
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,303
I've had it made, ever since
I got married to her!

70
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:58,873
And she even gave me
a certificate in you!

71
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:03,092
I've even found a girl.

72
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:06,941
I've only got to visit
Nirmal Village to finalise it.

73
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,567
A village?

74
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:14,809
You speak as if the word
has set your town on fire!

75
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,487
Yes, it's a village!
The Nirmal Village!

76
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,794
There's a beautiful
girl there...

77
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,460
who will be my daughter-in-law!

78
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:25,259
I even have a picture.
Want to see it?

79
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,136
No thank you!
Because it won't help!

80
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:32,048
We have a sensible son, Laxmi!

81
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:36,623
He knows, no one can change
his father's decision!

82
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,621
Now look, Dad...
don't talk about that!

83
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:43,074
I know how you got used
to liking bitter-gourd!

84
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:47,372
Don't you know? Bitter-gourd
is fantastic for health!

85
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,444
It cleanses the system!

86
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:51,675
It's good for the heart
and the brain, you know?

87
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,538
I don't! You're lying!

88
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,871
There's only one thing that's
good for the heart!

89
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,827
You must have a heart, that is!

90
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,642
Tomorrow's the Independence
Day of the India.

91
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:10,080
I've been invited over
by the Headmaster...

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,165
and the girl belongs to
the same village!

93
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,377
That's called killing two
birds with one stone!

94
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,620
Raise your voice, children!

95
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,120
Glory to Mother India!

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,135
Glory to Mother India!

97
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,416
I will request our Chief
Guest, Mr Chaudhary...

98
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,921
to say a few words
to the children.

99
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,636
Dear children, you are the
citizens of tomorrow.

100
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:21,917
I will say more than
a few words.

101
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,482
It has to do with the
slogan you chanted...

102
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,752
Glory to Mother India

103
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,866
I want to know what Glory
to Mother India means.

104
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,887
I want to know the importance
of the word Mother India

105
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:39,166
I will reward anyone who
gives me the right answer.

106
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,687
I'm surprised, children!

107
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,693
Don't you know the meaning
of the expression...

108
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:03,550
you were just chanting?

109
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:08,193
Is there no one in
the village...

110
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,338
who knows what the expression
Mother India means?

111
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,510
Go on... of course!

112
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:20,522
I can give you the answer!

113
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,867
Wonderful!
Do come forward, Madhuri!

114
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,825
She's the one I told
you about, Mr Chaudhary.

115
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:27,905
I recognised her.

116
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,411
Greetings.

117
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:33,527
Yes, dear? Should you
know the answer...

118
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,428
you might get the reward.

119
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:43,620
By Mother India, we are
referring to our nation.

120
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,722
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari...

121
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,944
from the Arabian Seas
to the Bay of Bengal...

122
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:49,984
all the religions and
faiths that it fosters...

123
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:54,524
the Bible, the Geeta and the Koran
symbolise the spirit of India.

124
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,885
Mother India is the soul
of the nation...

125
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:01,726
that is worshipped
even by the Gods.

126
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,879
Which is why it is
called Mother India.

127
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,670
Let's say together then.
To India...

128
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,145
Glory be!

129
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,646
Mother!

130
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,315
Where are you, mother?!

131
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,494
Madhuri has won a reward!

132
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:25,218
And the gentleman is personally
coming here to give her the reward!

133
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,592
Let's go out and see!
They must've arrived in their car.

134
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,543
- Mother!
- Come dear.

135
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,671
Welcome...

136
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:48,114
This is Mr Chaudhary I spoke
to you about, Ganga.

137
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:53,610
You should've told us about
your visit. I'd have...

138
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,013
Please don't worry.

139
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:59,824
The Head Master invited
us to the school today.

140
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,752
And we thought we could deal
with both things today.

141
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:05,497
- Deal with what?
- I'll explain.

142
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,918
I am greatly influenced
by my wife, Laxmi...

143
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,609
because she comes from the villages.
I believe that...

144
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:17,911
the beauty of the villages has a purity
and nobility that is lacking in cities

145
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:21,043
We have a son for whom
we had ideas...

146
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,606
after we saw a photograph
of Madhuri.

147
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:28,591
Now that we have met her and
seen how intelligent she is...

148
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,239
we have a greater idea!
Am I right?

149
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:35,206
It's time now to give
you the award, my dear.

150
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,464
We want to give our son to you
for life, as your reward.

151
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:46,812
We consider the alliance
sealed, if you don't mind.

152
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:54,608
Mr Chaudhary! I can't
begin to express myself!

153
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:58,848
To think that my daughter will be the
daughter-in-law of a rich household...

154
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,734
is something I couldn't
even dream about!

155
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,374
Madhuri must've done something
good to deserve this.

156
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,774
Let's discuss the dowry first.

157
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,414
Mr Chaudhary! Are you
talking of dowry?!

158
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,709
Of course, I want a dowry!

159
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,775
Because dowry is now
part of our culture!

160
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,546
Even after 25 years in the city,
I have not forgotten our culture.

161
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,459
As part of the dowry...

162
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,901
I want some bitter-gourd,
some green-grams...

163
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,908
snake-gourd, a pickle
of green-chillies...

164
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,861
and before I end my meal...

165
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,983
I want a porridge garnished
with dates and dry-fruits!

166
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:45,421
As dowry, I need a meal
that Madhuri has cooked.

167
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:49,380
Fantastic! Your daughter is
good looking and talented!

168
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,282
This food that she has cooked...

169
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,487
will leave me licking my
fingers for years to come!

170
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,807
Won't you have a
wedding date fixed, then?

171
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,536
I'm not a fool!

172
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,687
I even had the wedding date
fixed, before we came here.

173
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:06,527
Tuesday next is considered
to be very auspicious.

174
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,172
You have no objections, do you?

175
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:12,601
How can we?
We are fortunate indeed!

176
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,128
Can I've the good-fortune of meeting
my sister's future husband?

177
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,705
My sister answered your
questions and won a reward.

178
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,848
I will question your son, too...

179
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:26,595
and should he win, I will give
him my sister in marriage!

180
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,607
Certainly! Why not?
Let's go together.

181
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:33,461
I'm grateful to you, Teacher.

182
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:36,828
It's thanks to you that my
son's fortunes have looked up.

183
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:58,590
Your future brother-in-law
is here to meet you!

184
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,159
- What do you mean?
- Yes.

185
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,111
I've met the girl and
even fixed your wedding.

186
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,748
Have you even decided who
my brother-in-law will be?

187
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,355
I've never let anything
be half-done.

188
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:11,963
Now look...

189
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:15,296
your brother-in-law wants
to interview you.

190
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,926
- An interview?!
- Yes.

191
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:20,653
He's a simpleton
from the countryside.

192
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:23,514
You must deliberately lose...
which will make him happy.

193
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,166
But I've already
lost out, father.

194
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,715
- Shreekant!
- Coming over...!

195
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,731
Brother-in-law!

196
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,956
What misbehaviour is this?!

197
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,833
Not misbehaviour. That is the
tradition of our family!

198
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:50,087
You look like a film-star!

199
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:52,643
My sister is indeed
very fortunate!

200
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,916
He's my son, after all.

201
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:57,328
But hurry up and ask him
whatever you wish to.

202
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,431
My first question is...

203
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,843
what would happen, had we
not had the Himalayas?

204
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,236
That's an extremely
stupid question!

205
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:11,193
It's a great question!
Answer him, Amit!

206
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,890
Even the kids know that if
it wasn't for the Himalayas...

207
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,014
foreign powers would have
attacked our country.

208
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:21,258
Wonderful!
You're incomparable!

209
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,297
My second question is...

210
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:29,686
what would we have, if
not the Himalayas?

211
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,422
- What?!
- Of course! Answer me.

212
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:35,393
- What would we have, if not the Himalayas?
- What?

213
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,306
What would we have,
if not the Swiss Alps?

214
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,860
Had it not been for the alps...

215
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,140
the cool winds would've ruined
the crops in our nation.

216
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,565
Just as I am being ruined!

217
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,413
You're an intelligent man!

218
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,823
You score 101 marks out of 100!

219
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:57,301
My third is question is
a bit tricky. Be careful.

220
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,213
What would happen, if we
had not the Swiss Alps?

221
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:06,090
You've trapped him!
Do you have an answer?

222
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,178
I give up to you and to...

223
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:15,665
this chap you've chosen
for my brother-in-law!

224
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:18,696
- I don't know the answer!
- I'll explain!

225
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,321
What would Tensingh climb,
if not the Swiss Alps?

226
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,081
Bravo! That's wonderful!

227
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:32,275
What's up? Why are you
winking at me?

228
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:36,323
- What's the mystery all about?
- It's a bad omen actually.

229
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:39,570
A blinking eye is considered
to be inauspicious.

230
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,586
- And I have both eyes shutting up!
- Must be conjunctivitis!

231
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,401
It has spread in the whole city!
Let me put give you some eye-drops.

232
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,601
No thank you! You need
the eye-drops actually!

233
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,184
For what is going on in
the name of Swiss Alps...

234
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,833
should you cure your eyes,
mine will be fine, too!

235
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,419
I spoke of your sight...
and you talk of attitudes!

236
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:04,128
Let's go and eat, Shrikant.

237
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:09,955
Wow! I have yet to eat
something so delicious!

238
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,890
Look! Don't we both
share the same tastes?

239
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,572
Tell me something;
my sister will accompany...

240
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:19,391
your son to London after
the wedding, won't she?

241
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:21,161
But naturally!

242
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:24,642
The couple will live
together after their wedding.

243
00:17:24,722 --> 00:17:27,227
Get the Rasagollas for
Shrikant. It's in the fridge.

244
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:30,720
- Maharaj...
- Go and fetch it yourself!

245
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,522
Please go and fetch it!

246
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:33,759
Okay.

247
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,317
Now listen, son...
I have something to ask you.

248
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,397
Yes. Go on...

249
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,570
I'm told that village folks
bury gold in their courtyard.

250
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:48,410
It's true. I've heard of it, too.

251
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,567
In the marriage of
your sister, then...

252
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:54,402
Listen! Where are
the rasagollas?

253
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:58,487
It's in my room. In my
briefcase, actually.

254
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,531
- In your briefcase?
- Yes. Hurry up and fetch it.

255
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,980
Weren't you asking
me something, sir?

256
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,582
I was telling you
something, actually.

257
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,456
It's a marriage, after all.
It's no joke...

258
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:16,559
so much of the buried gold does
your sister get in marriage?

259
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,362
You will give her at least
200 grams of gold, won't you?

260
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,343
200 grams? But of course!

261
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:34,160
I must give her that much...
naturally!

262
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,477
In fact, you can consider
it given to her already!

263
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,745
I'll be back in a minute!

264
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,637
- Won't you have the rasagollas?
- No thank you. I've had enough.

265
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,647
Well... have you been
up to your jokes again?

266
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,196
Not at all!

267
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:55,349
I've set the stage
for a joke though!

268
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,104
What am I to do now?

269
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:03,247
Although it's the question
of my sister's life...

270
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,911
where will I bring
200 grams of gold from?

271
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,903
I will have to face
this problem somehow!

272
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,943
My sister will surely be
married! She surely will!

273
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,975
If it wasn't for our jokes...

274
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:19,204
life would be so dull and drab!

275
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:26,166
Jokes and laughter add
years to one's life.

276
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,928
Isn't that why both of us
are in the pink of health?

277
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,099
Welcome, Shreekant.

278
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,756
- Do we have a deal, then?
- What is the deal?

279
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,485
That one about the 200
grams of gold, of course!

280
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,869
Naturally! It was a deal the
moment you mentioned it!

281
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:48,302
Let's shake then...
Come on!

282
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:53,008
Give this sari to Madhuri
and tell her...

283
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,407
that it's a token of
our affection for her.

284
00:19:56,503 --> 00:20:00,453
We're now waiting for
the auspicious moment...

285
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:05,185
when she comes here as
our daughter-in-law.

286
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,958
"It's like adding
spice to life..."

287
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,323
"When the groom is
fairer than the bride"

288
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:49,142
"The one who steals the heart
is fairer than his bride..."

289
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,179
"How do you like them?
Fair-skinned or dark?"

290
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:05,569
"Tell me how you'd like
your husband to be?"

291
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:10,419
"Let me go...
don't pester me"

292
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:21,650
"How do I tell you
or explain..."

293
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,967
"My choice is hidden
deep down in my heart"

294
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:13,998
"It'll be difficult to
woo the fair-skinned one..."

295
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:17,819
"And the dark one will
attract taunts from everyone"

296
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,784
"Be he fair-skinned
or dark..."

297
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:35,578
"It is he.
I will have to live with"

298
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:37,691
"The fair-skinned one
will be an arrogant one..."

299
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:39,711
"While the dark one will
suffer from complexes"

300
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,350
"You will lose your sleep
and be restless"

301
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:47,548
"Do tell me then... what
kind of a husband do you want?"

302
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:52,684
"Let me go...
do not pester me"

303
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:57,355
"How do I tell you
or explain this..."

304
00:22:57,435 --> 00:23:01,362
"My choice lies hidden
deep down in my heart"

305
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:45,099
"Should he be tall
or short in height?"

306
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,228
"Should he be skinny
or plump like a wrestler?"

307
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,752
"Be he skinny or strong..."

308
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:06,636
"I only hope he is not
evil at heart"

309
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,684
"The tall one will
inflict cruelties..."

310
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,585
"The shorter one will look odd"

311
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,572
"How will you
take the weight..."

312
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,518
"Should you find
a fat husband?"

313
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:18,478
"Do tell us then... what kind
of a husband do you want?"

314
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,129
"Do let me go...
don't pester me"

315
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,006
"How do I explain
or tell you..."

316
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:32,248
"My choice lies in my dreams"

317
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,817
"What is this I hear,
my friend..."

318
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:07,499
"That they've chosen
a city-bred for you?"

319
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,667
"The city-bred have a
colourful nature..."

320
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:15,586
"They're always chasing
the pretty ones"

321
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:19,641
"I shall turn myself into
what he'd like..."

322
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:23,514
"And win over my
husband's heart"

323
00:25:23,594 --> 00:25:27,481
"What if you slip
and fumble?"

324
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:31,432
"Whom will you tell the
truth, if not to us?"

325
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:35,255
"Do tell us then...
what husband do you want?"

326
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:40,266
"Let me go!
Don't pester me"

327
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,652
"How do I tell you
or explain this?"

328
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:49,077
"My choice lies hidden
in my dreams"

329
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,861
Congratulations on your wedding!

330
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,351
- Greetings, Madam.
- Greetings.

331
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,801
I have a small gift for you.

332
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:09,696
Look at it through my glasses...

333
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,691
- it's genuine gold.
- You are a jeweller.

334
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:15,201
Who will bring gold, if not you?

335
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,570
I guessed the moment I saw
your wife...

336
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,862
as to why you suddenly
agreed to the wedding.

337
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:24,363
To be honest, I don't know how
my wife has approved of me!

338
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:35,132
She's in Nirmal Village!

339
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:38,139
A bride for you, as
beautiful as gold itself!

340
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,991
She'll be my daughter-in-law!

341
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,979
Look at Harish!
Isn't he delighted?!

342
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,927
People who don't marry, regret
it all their live, really!

343
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,139
And those who marry
regret it even more!

344
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,132
- Oh, come on!
- I'm already regretting it.

345
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,318
But I'm helpless.

346
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:05,686
How would a poor goat
face a hungry tiger?

347
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,012
Something wrong, Amit?
You hardly look happy.

348
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,869
How'd I be happy especially since
I'm marrying a village-belle?

349
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,548
A village-belle, do you get it?

350
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:18,746
Tell me... how can I ever
bring a village-belle...

351
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:21,038
to a gathering of this kind?

352
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,499
You can always refuse.
Why get worked up?

353
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,672
Refuse, eh?
Refuse my father?!

354
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,109
You don't know my old man!

355
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:32,042
He strides across like
an elephant...

356
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:36,349
watches me like an owl
and roars like a lion!

357
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:41,343
This liquor you're having
is a funny thing, Amit.

358
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:45,069
Two extra drinks could
dwarf a giant!

359
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,793
Have a couple of
quick ones then...

360
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,353
and call it an attack
on your old man!

361
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,959
What insolence is this?!

362
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:35,581
This is a gun...
not insolence!

363
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,804
It's loaded with six bullets
which will decide things!

364
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,125
What nonsense are you talking?

365
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:43,406
Where've you picked up
that piece of junk from?

366
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,987
You're the Junk-seller...

367
00:28:46,228 --> 00:28:48,779
who's saddling me with
all the unwanted things!

368
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,178
You have called me
a junk-seller!

369
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,967
Not even your grandpa
ever called me that!

370
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,596
You, son of my grandpa
in Heaven...

371
00:28:57,031 --> 00:28:59,273
prepare to leave
for heaven, too!

372
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,096
Are you going to kill me
with that toy-gun?

373
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,931
You'll get a slap from me!

374
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:08,244
This is no toy!
It's a real pistol!

375
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:16,913
And this last bullet...

376
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:19,141
will find my father's heart!

377
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,478
Should you insist
on this marriage...

378
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,441
Go ahead and fire! But you
will marry that very girl!

379
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,772
- No way!
- Of course, you will!

380
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,880
- No!
- You will certainly!

381
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:42,048
What have you done, Amit?
How could you do this?

382
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:44,492
That which I should have
done long ago!

383
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:48,368
Note down my last wish, Laxmi.

384
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:51,648
That which must be followed.

385
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,855
If my last wish is
not adhered to...

386
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:59,867
my soul will haunt this man
as a ghost, all his life!

387
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:04,749
Don't say that!
Nothing will happen to you!

388
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:08,909
Very well, Laxmi...
I must leave now.

389
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,358
Forgive me for any wrong
I've done...

390
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:18,848
I have a regret, though. I can't
see my son getting married.

391
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:27,196
Impossible! I can't do it!

392
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:30,502
Looks like I'm surely
going to get married!

393
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,138
Have you got it, teacher?

394
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,699
I've looked for you all over,
and here you are.

395
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:59,387
Wow! They look genuine!

396
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:05,015
If man could help it, he'd even have
fake-men look like real!

397
00:31:06,894 --> 00:31:10,621
By the way, which drama are
you staging this festival?

398
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:12,066
I'm playing Satyavan Savitri.

399
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:14,881
I'm going to wear these
ornaments and play the role.

400
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:19,048
Are preparations for
Madhuri's wedding over?

401
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:23,707
Should you need help from me,
please don't hesitate.

402
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:28,872
What more than this
can you do, Teacher?

403
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:31,739
I need God to help me now.

404
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,164
Good-bye.

405
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:49,520
Your bridegroom is here!

406
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,991
It's considered auspicious to
see him before the wedding!

407
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:16,820
Is the groom blind? He's wearing
dark-glasses even at night!

408
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:22,267
He's had it, even before
he has set his eyes on her!

409
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,458
Call the bride.
It's time for the vows.

410
00:33:03,663 --> 00:33:05,105
There she is!

411
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:50,150
Stop showering petals on us!
This marriage will not take place!

412
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:52,512
What nonsense are you talking?
The vows are over.

413
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:56,226
No, father! This is no wedding.
It's a joke! A farce!

414
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,819
Come to your senses! How can
you retract after the vows...

415
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:02,516
Such a marriage cannot
be called a marriage, dad!

416
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:03,808
Why not?

417
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,389
You told me that girls from
the village are pure as gold.

418
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:12,872
Then ask the village-belle, why
are they giving us fake gold?

419
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:19,147
You have always worshipped
people from the villages, dad.

420
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,272
But you can see for yourself...

421
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,872
how these people have taken
a gullible man for a ride!

422
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:27,004
When the gold they
give us is fake...

423
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,112
the bride must be a fake, too!

424
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,580
To be honest, I think
everything here...

425
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,032
including her brother and
mother, appear to be fake!

426
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:38,032
Especially the brother!

427
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:45,076
Are the ornaments fake,
Shreekant?

428
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,906
I'll explain this, my son!

429
00:35:56,485 --> 00:36:01,189
I joked with Shreekant that
I wanted 200 grams of gold.

430
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:05,804
And that which is given
in a joke is always fake...

431
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:06,973
not genuine!

432
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,644
You have come to be a
professional joker, dad.

433
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,981
In the process, you were about
to make a mockery of my life!

434
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,840
But not anymore!

435
00:36:16,897 --> 00:36:19,192
Should these fake people
still appeal to you...

436
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,462
you can take to them.

437
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,445
You can indulge them
and the fake bride!

438
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,937
Do as you please!
But I'm leaving now.

439
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:41,659
Sir! Please save us
from ruination!

440
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,792
God alone is the saviour, son.

441
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:48,398
But I have made a very
big mistake, too.

442
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:51,023
I didn't know...

443
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,239
that a small joke would
lead to such a calamity.

444
00:36:57,178 --> 00:37:00,701
That a spark could
ignite a raging fire!

445
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:06,102
My son is a hot-blooded youth.

446
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,418
It'll take him time
to cool down.

447
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,792
But please don't worry.

448
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:16,079
Very soon, I shall take
my daughter-in-law away...

449
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:17,984
with all due ceremonies
and honour.

450
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:20,812
This is my promise to you.
Good-bye.

451
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:36,844
You've saved a friend today.
You've saved me from being ruined.

452
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,721
That's okay. But I'm terribly
angry at your father.

453
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:42,566
How could he decide anything
without his son's consent?

454
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:44,998
I will decide things for
myself, in the future.

455
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,334
You sinner!

456
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:53,371
You have ruined your
sister's life!

457
00:37:55,122 --> 00:38:00,761
Hit me, mother!
I have sinned!

458
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,119
I have ruined my sister's life!

459
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:09,272
No! Before you hit him,
you must realise...

460
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:13,769
that he did it all
for my welfare.

461
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,072
You must forgive him.

462
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,953
There's no point in crying
or regretting anything now.

463
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,791
A controversy which began
with fake-jewellery...

464
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,353
eventually boiled down to
faces he didn't like.

465
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:31,491
But don't worry, Mom.

466
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:34,672
If there is sacred
anything in my marriage...

467
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:38,181
it will break the shackles
of falsehoods...

468
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:42,550
and help me settle down
with my husband one day!

469
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,716
There are women waiting
for the interview, sir.

470
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,285
- Have all the ladies arrived?
- Yes, sir.

471
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,129
I'll be there in a moment!

472
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,763
My name is Kumar Chatterji.

473
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:41,581
I happen to be the whole
and soul of the company...

474
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:44,748
where nothing moves
without my permission!

475
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:46,668
So you'd better give me...

476
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:49,261
all the crucial information
about yourselves.

477
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:55,352
My name is Manju Chaudhary.
I stay at Vakola, Santacruz.

478
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:07,794
Have you come for the view...
I mean, for the interview?

479
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,102
- Yes.
- Please sit down.

480
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,061
Sit here.

481
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:22,057
- Can you give me your contact number?
- Why?

482
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:26,816
I might need it in
an emergency, you see!

483
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:33,361
Let me land the job first.
The contact comes later.

484
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:36,810
You can consider yourself employed!

485
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:47,389
- Who's the gentleman?
- Our boss!

486
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:50,085
He's the one who will
interview all of you.

487
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,377
- This is Bhagat here.
- Yes, Mr Bhagat?

488
00:41:57,754 --> 00:42:01,499
I have decided to employ the
Minister's niece as the secretary.

489
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:02,899
She will assume charge on Monday.

490
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:05,815
But I've summoned many girls
for the interview, sir.

491
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:08,992
- What will I say to them?
- Do as you are told, Amit.

492
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,731
This has to do with the
minister's niece.

493
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:22,335
Have Kumar sent to me.

494
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:24,744
It stops. And...

495
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:28,054
Mr Kumar! The boss wants you inside.

496
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:31,104
See? Nothing moves here
without my permission!

497
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:33,110
Excuse me, I'll just be back.

498
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:40,104
- Did you send for me?
- Yes. Go and cancel the interviews.

499
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:43,280
I get it! You must've got
a call from the M.D.!

500
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,731
Sure. You're a smart guy!
Now go and call off the interviews.

501
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:49,635
And see that none of them
takes offence.

502
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:54,326
Don't worry, sir! I've called off
so many interviews... in the past!

503
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:05,375
Ladies!

504
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:09,373
I have bad news!

505
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:13,841
My boss received a call
from his doctor just now.

506
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:18,143
And that which he feared
has turned out to be true!

507
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,812
What's wrong with him?

508
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,229
He's suffering from
a cancer of the piles!

509
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:27,494
Strange are God's ways!

510
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:32,824
Such a tall and handsome man,
fair and broad-chested...

511
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:36,935
suffering from cancer...
that too, of piles!

512
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,922
Please convey our
best wishes to him!

513
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,949
That's a contagious disease!
Let's return.

514
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:47,960
Haven't you left, Madam.

515
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:52,880
No, sir. Because I want
to rush you to the hospital.

516
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:59,220
I'm sure it's you who has
the cancer, not your boss.

517
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:04,063
Hats off to you, madam!
You're a smart one!

518
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:06,104
But I'm no less.

519
00:44:06,184 --> 00:44:10,409
So let me tell you what
the man inside has cooked.

520
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:13,804
Our boss received a call
from a superior...

521
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,986
to employ someone he favours.

522
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,816
Which is why I had to
fake the illness.

523
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:20,631
But you...
you're incomparable!

524
00:44:20,711 --> 00:44:24,058
But I promise to set you up
the moment I get the chance!

525
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,706
You're an interesting man, too.

526
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:50,053
My name is Malti Chaudhary.
I came here for the interview.

527
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:53,869
But your assistant said that
you're suffering from cancer.

528
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:55,100
What?

529
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,500
Cancer?! Who? Me?!
He's a bloody liar!

530
00:44:58,703 --> 00:45:02,481
Of course! All the girls prayed
for you, before they left.

531
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,434
But I stayed back to find out...

532
00:45:05,606 --> 00:45:07,654
the nature of the cancer
afflicting you.

533
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:11,167
Is it the cancer of bribes?
Of employing a relative?

534
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:13,375
Or is it the cancer
of influence?

535
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,839
What exactly is the nature
of your cancer?

536
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:18,486
You are accusing me.

537
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:24,099
I will expose the truth behind
your so called interviews!

538
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,765
I will take this story of
deceit to the newspapers!

539
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:29,931
Let people know how
rich people like you...

540
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:33,127
take advantage of
the deprived class!

541
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:37,392
It's sad that I haven't even
got to tell you that...

542
00:45:37,472 --> 00:45:41,756
I've practiced hard to improve
my typing speed to 80 wpm.

543
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:43,396
I have won a distinction
in shorthand...

544
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:45,890
and I've topped in my course
of Secretarial Practice.

545
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:48,680
But I will not spare you!

546
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:58,049
Stop the girl who has walked
out of my office.

547
00:45:58,129 --> 00:45:59,412
And come inside immediately.

548
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:15,133
Mr Bhagat? A girl just stormed
into my office.

549
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:17,658
She has threatened to expose
us all in the newspapers.

550
00:46:18,168 --> 00:46:20,930
This thing about employing the
minister's niece...

551
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,382
can give us a bad name.

552
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,350
Okay. Thank you.

553
00:46:25,443 --> 00:46:28,681
Give the girl her
appointment letter.

554
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:34,515
- You're a great man, sir.
- And you're a cheap guy!

555
00:46:34,744 --> 00:46:39,961
If you lie ever again, you
will discover my greatness!

556
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:42,513
You are a great man, no doubt.

557
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:44,659
But by employing the girl...

558
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:49,173
you have driven away
my disappointment!

559
00:46:58,305 --> 00:46:59,952
- You're done!
- What?!

560
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:03,303
Naturally! With someone
like me for a fan...

561
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:06,960
everything had to pale
into insignificance!

562
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:10,575
After I lectured the
boss about you...

563
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:12,951
he begged at my feet!

564
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,719
Please employ her, he said!

565
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:18,163
And so... here's your
appointment letter.

566
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,196
Listen... this is important.

567
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,489
We will be working
together, no doubt.

568
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:35,569
But if I may be able to help you
economically or physically...

569
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:39,237
I'll be pleased to oblige,
and so will you!

570
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:40,317
Pardon me?

571
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:42,849
Very well.

572
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,826
Very well indeed!

573
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,293
- Sister! How are you?
- I'm fine.

574
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:33,773
Careful!

575
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,180
How did it go?

576
00:48:37,028 --> 00:48:38,770
- I'll tell you...
- What happened?

577
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,708
Just what I wanted.
I have got the job.

578
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:42,790
What?!

579
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,734
Have you got a job as
his private secretary?!

580
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:48,777
- Yes!
- Didn't he recognise you?!

581
00:48:50,206 --> 00:48:54,531
No. He hasn't still got rid
of his dark-glasses.

582
00:48:56,382 --> 00:48:59,187
All this has happened
because of me, isn't it?

583
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:02,600
Hadn't I done something
so foolish that day...

584
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:07,703
you'd have been living
peacefully with your husband.

585
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:10,092
Stop cribbing and crying!

586
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:13,106
All you did was to care for
your sister's well-being!

587
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:16,371
I need your help right now.

588
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:20,483
I can't succeed in this
drama without your help.

589
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,527
You will help me, won't you?

590
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,579
I'd do more than laying
down my life for you, sis.

591
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:31,249
It won't come to that,
God-willing.

592
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:39,546
- Look at Madhuri going!
- She's got the city airs!

593
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:42,230
The high-heeled sandals,
the swaying gait...

594
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,342
And look carefully!

595
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:47,069
She has even wiped out the
matrimonial vermillion!

596
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:49,823
There's no dearth of
vermillion in Bombay...

597
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,040
nor that of people who'd
be interested in her!

598
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,402
Look at her ways!

599
00:49:55,938 --> 00:49:57,698
The Bombay-bird indeed!

600
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:04,781
Have some tea, dear.

601
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:17,335
Why are you looking
at me like this, mom?

602
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,262
It's nothing, dear.

603
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:26,160
I know what you have to go
through, for my sake, mom.

604
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,394
You have to put up
with a lot of jibes.

605
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:32,935
How far have you gone away
from our culture, Madhuri?

606
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,214
You have even wiped away
the matrimonial vermillion!

607
00:50:41,715 --> 00:50:44,442
Of what use is the vermillion...

608
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,017
that returned after
reaching my forehead?

609
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:49,985
If there is any strength in
my belief of my marriage...

610
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:52,757
the vermillion will return
to my forehead one day!

611
00:50:57,852 --> 00:51:01,909
Your son-in-law is the
boss of the company...

612
00:51:02,636 --> 00:51:05,139
where I've been employed.

613
00:51:05,536 --> 00:51:09,130
Really? Hasn't he
recognised you, then?

614
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:12,939
No. He's just been
introduced to me.

615
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,582
He'll get to know
me very soon, too.

616
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:19,830
I only need your blessings now.

617
00:51:21,432 --> 00:51:25,594
O Goddess Mother! Just as You can be
pleased and angry with your devotees...

618
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:28,316
Your devotees have the
right to...

619
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:31,337
be angry and happy
with You, too.

620
00:51:31,908 --> 00:51:35,545
I'm terribly angry with You
for what You've done to us!

621
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:37,842
My son has been married...

622
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:39,955
but my daughter-in-law
hasn't come home!

623
00:51:40,035 --> 00:51:42,043
I will not pray to You
till such time...

624
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:45,070
as Madhuri comes here
as my daughter-in-law!

625
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,825
Do come...

626
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:14,068
Have you never been in love?

627
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,566
I want a rose with fragrance and
you bring me one that stinks!

628
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:19,606
Do you want one that has
more fragrance than this?

629
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:22,836
I'll get it for you.
But do talk to me!

630
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,731
Sure... No!

631
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:27,815
- Go outside and attend to the forward and backward...
- What?

632
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,358
I mean, the inward and
outward correspondence!

633
00:52:29,382 --> 00:52:32,479
That's what I'm always doing!
What a bore!

634
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:02,716
How often have I told you
not to call me Uncle?

635
00:53:03,702 --> 00:53:07,670
What do I call an uncle,
if not Uncle?

636
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,007
Don't you try to act
smart with me...!

637
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:14,522
And if you must really
call someone uncle...

638
00:53:14,602 --> 00:53:16,817
you can always call
Anthony that!

639
00:53:21,271 --> 00:53:23,117
The score's 30 for no loss, sir!

640
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:31,053
- What was he saying?
- He asked me to call you uncle!

641
00:53:34,977 --> 00:53:40,363
I always steal a rose from
the neighbour's garden...

642
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:44,711
brave the ferocious dog there
and bring it to you!

643
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:47,813
It's beautiful, isn't it?

644
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:51,073
But although I have presented
you with 25 roses...

645
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,393
I have still to win over
your heart!

646
00:53:59,835 --> 00:54:01,656
I always spray a perfume
on it...

647
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:03,838
so its fragrance
never wears off.

648
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:09,962
But alas! The fragrance
of my love...

649
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,524
never reaches your
beautiful nose!

650
00:55:21,437 --> 00:55:24,301
- That's a beautiful rose!
- Isn't it?

651
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,621
- Who brought it?
- I did.

652
00:55:27,328 --> 00:55:28,686
It's a strange thing,
isn't it...

653
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:31,694
that the rose always smells
of different perfumes.

654
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:38,737
Brut, Charlie, Sex Appeal,
Henna...

655
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:42,287
Henna? That's right!

656
00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:46,274
I love roses!
So does my mother.

657
00:55:46,354 --> 00:55:49,704
And she'd love to meet you.

658
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:52,573
So why don't you come over
to my place next Sunday?

659
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,498
But don't tell Boss about it.

660
00:55:55,883 --> 00:56:00,154
He's a good man.
But he's dull and boring.

661
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:02,631
He knows nothing of romance
and wouldn't understand this!

662
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,603
- We have an urgent meeting to attend.
- Go ahead, sir.

663
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:11,493
- You will come along, too!
- I?

664
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:12,773
Come on!

665
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:23,253
The lady is here, sir.

666
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:30,531
I'm going out.

667
00:56:30,946 --> 00:56:33,944
There are some papers in the
file which I want you to type.

668
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:36,185
There's another thing.

669
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:37,795
I'm happy with your work.

670
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:41,255
But you'd better not waste
time in unnecessary things.

671
00:58:14,747 --> 00:58:17,251
I'm sorry, but I didn't
notice you coming.

672
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,191
How would you? You were busy
admiring the photograph.

673
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,182
Is that your boyfriend?

674
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,836
He's a boy, all right.
But he's still not a friend.

675
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:31,143
He's my boss, actually.

676
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:33,033
It's a cakewalk for you,
in that case!

677
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:37,478
Men are usually very careless.

678
00:58:38,032 --> 00:58:42,197
If they find someone taking
proper care of them...

679
00:58:42,277 --> 00:58:45,161
they could even make
good husbands!

680
00:58:45,951 --> 00:58:48,352
In any case, a beautiful
girl like you...

681
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:51,733
can be had only by a very
fortunate man!

682
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:57,101
Here's your rent.

683
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,226
Mark my words.

684
00:59:01,689 --> 00:59:05,010
This boss will one day
be a slave to you!

685
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,586
Just you watch!

686
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:11,026
Care for some tea?

687
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:13,854
Don't bother about bringing it.
I'll fetch it myself!

688
00:59:15,008 --> 00:59:16,368
Here's a set of
handkerchiefs, sis.

689
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:18,697
I've bought them with the
salary I've received.

690
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:21,657
Tell me something.

691
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,835
You're normally scolding me
for being careless...

692
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:27,186
and not looking after my things.

693
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:31,211
But where have you lost
your hanky today?

694
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:22,767
- Have you sent for me, sir?
- Yes.

695
01:00:23,254 --> 01:00:25,410
I wanted to thank you.
Do sit down.

696
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,450
May I fetch a pad if you
want to dictate a letter?

697
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:33,609
Have you ever met
a careless man?

698
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,803
What? Oh yes, I have...
I'm meeting one right now.

699
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,996
Me, you mean?

700
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:42,293
I wonder when I'll
stop being so careless.

701
01:00:42,373 --> 01:00:45,380
You have considered my cabin
as your own...

702
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,698
and cleaned out all the mess.

703
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:55,077
But your carelessness can
lead to a setback.

704
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:59,351
You could lose something
precious, out of carelessness.

705
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:01,227
Won't that be a pity?

706
01:01:01,894 --> 01:01:05,166
Your cabin was in bad shape.
Especially your files.

707
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:07,251
I remembered it from my
very first day here.

708
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,298
No matter what you remember...

709
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:11,227
but you also have
a very bad memory.

710
01:01:11,597 --> 01:01:12,722
Pardon me?

711
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:17,895
- You've forgotten something, too.
- Have you remembered it then?

712
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,880
Naturally. How can I forget
something I possess?

713
01:01:23,965 --> 01:01:25,786
What are you staring at me for?

714
01:01:25,866 --> 01:01:30,748
It's the handkerchief
that you forgot!

715
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:34,853
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

716
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:37,418
You're participating in the
badminton matches this time.

717
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:38,903
Why don't we have a match, too?

718
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:44,636
I always lose miserably,
while you're a champion.

719
01:01:44,716 --> 01:01:48,105
Okay. But one who wins
can always lose...

720
01:01:48,185 --> 01:01:49,375
and the loser might
even win a game.

721
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:51,839
Let's a question of playing and
you must have a match with me.

722
01:01:53,508 --> 01:01:55,795
You can consider me game.

723
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:10,981
You?! What are you
doing here?

724
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:15,169
Funny! But I was about to ask
you the same question.

725
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:18,276
Are you to here to
make a match with someone?

726
01:02:18,356 --> 01:02:21,184
Not to make a match...
but to play one!

727
01:02:21,423 --> 01:02:23,941
Am I not a loyal man, sir?

728
01:02:24,021 --> 01:02:28,177
I've come all the way to
watch you play goodminton!

729
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,763
Goodminton? What on earth is that?

730
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:34,090
When a super-player like
you plays bad-minton...

731
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,374
it's bound to earn the
name of good-minton!

732
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:41,725
Welcome, Ms Malti!

733
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,232
The shuttlecock is here!

734
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:46,788
Get cracking, sir!

735
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,400
- What are you doing here?
- I came here for the fragrance.

736
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,622
But since you are here, you bring
the spring with you!

737
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,568
Should we start the game?

738
01:02:58,898 --> 01:03:01,354
What do you think, Mr Kumar?
Should we start?

739
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:05,775
- Why are you asking him?!
- Get cracking, the two of you!

740
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:09,253
The ideal moment of the day!

741
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:12,576
Get, set and go!

742
01:03:14,242 --> 01:03:17,270
- How'd he get here?
- I wouldn't know!

743
01:03:18,598 --> 01:03:22,179
- Who's into service, sir?
- Service?

744
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:24,068
Who'll serve first?

745
01:03:27,756 --> 01:03:29,155
Let's get started!

746
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:12,103
You've lost a love-game!

747
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,957
Oh no! He's the champ.

748
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:17,119
He lost because
he wanted me to win.

749
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:22,027
You have a heart then?
I wear it on my sleeve!

750
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:25,978
Keep your promise now and
treat us to some Chinese food.

751
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:27,314
That's a good idea!
Let's go.

752
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:30,436
But you don't eat Chinese
food, do you?

753
01:04:30,516 --> 01:04:33,299
How about your allergy?

754
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:35,730
Anyway, thanks for the game.
I must leave now.

755
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,109
Keep this, sir.
You can play with it!

756
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:43,643
It's good that you
called me over, madam.

757
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:46,704
Or they use badminton
as an excuse for rape!

758
01:04:46,784 --> 01:04:50,041
The other day, a sixty-year
old woman was lured...

759
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:33,630
Why did you plant the
cauliflower in my cabin?

760
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,905
The roses are always passed
on to the other girl!

761
01:05:37,242 --> 01:05:41,444
You can have this cauliflower
and give her some, too!

762
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:44,037
If I had to give her
vegetables, why would...

763
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:46,024
I give her a cauliflower?

764
01:05:46,104 --> 01:05:49,778
I could give her bananas,
bitter-gourd or anything!

765
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:54,204
Give anything you wish!
To hell with it!

766
01:05:55,259 --> 01:05:56,884
I wonder where they come from!

767
01:05:58,233 --> 01:05:59,318
Come in.

768
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,934
The score is 340 runs for
9 wickets, sir.

769
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,114
Did I ask you for the score?
Go and fetch me a flower.

770
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:08,504
- What file, sir?
- Not file! A flower! A rose!

771
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:10,798
- What colour?
- A red one will do!

772
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:13,598
One like your cheek...
No! Like mine!

773
01:06:14,106 --> 01:06:15,525
Here's the money.
Hurry up.

774
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:21,668
I'll personally give her
a rose today.

775
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:26,652
Welcome, Mr Kumar.

776
01:06:26,837 --> 01:06:28,594
What perfume does your
rose have today?

777
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,593
But this is the first time
I've brought you a rose!

778
01:06:33,646 --> 01:06:36,487
Now look; you bring me
a rose everyday.

779
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:40,702
Why don't you admit that?
I haven't turned it down, have I?

780
01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:44,597
Yes, I bring one everyday.
You like roses, don't you?

781
01:06:44,677 --> 01:06:48,387
Yes. I love them. Where do you
bring such beautiful roses from?

782
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:50,588
- I steal them!
- Speak softly!

783
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:51,133
Why?

784
01:06:51,213 --> 01:06:54,388
- What if someone hears you?
- I'm not scared of anyone!

785
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,306
- But I'm scared.
- Of whom?

786
01:06:56,386 --> 01:06:57,107
The boss, of course.

787
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:59,201
The boss?

788
01:07:01,198 --> 01:07:05,116
Tell you what? Put the
rose in my hair...

789
01:07:05,196 --> 01:07:08,014
and return to your cabin.
Okay?

790
01:07:21,185 --> 01:07:25,056
When will you meet me again?

791
01:07:26,577 --> 01:07:29,770
- Tonight?
- Tonight?! Where is that?

792
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:33,351
- In your dreams.
- Dreams?

793
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:35,664
Wonderful! That's the best place!

794
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:38,039
Neither will the evil
boss hound us...

795
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:39,759
nor will the fat girl be around!

796
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:45,194
Just you and me...
just the two of us!

797
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:55,426
Sit down, Mr Kumar.

798
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,376
I've got to ask you some
important questions.

799
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,945
I've already put in 10 years
of service in this company.

800
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,890
Do you intend to interview me
all over again?

801
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:05,571
Yes. You could say that.

802
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:09,423
How many branches do we
have all over the country?

803
01:08:09,894 --> 01:08:11,263
- 22 branches.
- We have 23.

804
01:08:11,947 --> 01:08:14,702
We are starting a new branch
on the Nicobar Islands.

805
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,189
You mean, the one called
Andaman and Nicobar Islands?

806
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:20,845
Fantastic! Congratulations!

807
01:08:20,925 --> 01:08:23,512
Ever since you've joined the
systems and communications...

808
01:08:23,591 --> 01:08:25,206
our company is making
great progress!

809
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:29,371
- Congratulations to you, too.
- Thank you. But what for?

810
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:31,365
You have been given a promotion.

811
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:34,866
Have I? Thank you very much.

812
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:39,227
You are being appointed
manager of the new branch.

813
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:43,328
The new branch at Nicobar?

814
01:08:43,526 --> 01:08:46,034
You mean, I'll have
to go there?!

815
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:48,510
We need a responsible man there.

816
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,838
And who could be more
responsible than you are?

817
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,238
You have been misinformed, sir!

818
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,176
I am the most irresponsible man in
the organisation! It's the truth!

819
01:08:56,256 --> 01:08:57,706
How can you say that?

820
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,669
Although our office opens
at 10.00...

821
01:09:00,285 --> 01:09:02,590
you usually walked in
at 11 or 11.30 a.m.

822
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,670
But nowadays, you are here
on the dot at 9.30 a.m.!

823
01:09:04,877 --> 01:09:06,953
That too, with a rose in hand!

824
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:12,311
You've worked wonders with our
systems and communications!

825
01:09:13,754 --> 01:09:18,150
But isn't Nicobar Island
very far away, sir?

826
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:21,295
That's okay. You won't
be swimming across anyway.

827
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,815
We'll give you an
air-ticket instead.

828
01:09:22,975 --> 01:09:25,078
Even out there, you will
have no real problems.

829
01:09:25,421 --> 01:09:27,621
Although you will not
find any roses around...

830
01:09:27,701 --> 01:09:29,345
there are girls aplenty.

831
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,468
Of the man-eating variety!

832
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:39,391
I'd gladly be a peon
in this office!

833
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:41,792
But please don't banish me
to Nicobar, sir!

834
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,749
I'll be ruined, sir!

835
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:47,882
There's a condition.
No more roses!

836
01:09:57,552 --> 01:09:58,552
Malti?

837
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:02,750
Sit down.

838
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:05,759
Let's begin with the dictation.

839
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:15,015
What was he doing to you
behind the glass-panel?

840
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:20,443
He was putting a rose
in my hair, sir.

841
01:10:20,602 --> 01:10:22,572
A rose? I see!

842
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:31,669
- I've written that, sir.
- Really? Let's proceed...

843
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,995
Did he cuddle up to you
in the cab?

844
01:10:36,684 --> 01:10:37,775
Yes.

845
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:48,004
What else did he do to you
in the cab? Did he talk a lot?

846
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,353
Yes, he did.

847
01:10:51,754 --> 01:10:55,001
He told me that I look very
beautiful in a pink sari.

848
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,604
He's right!
You do look beautiful!

849
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:07,781
How far did he take you
in the cab?

850
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:11,924
- Far... far away.
- Very far.

851
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:15,997
He wanted to take me home
to meet his mother.

852
01:11:17,518 --> 01:11:19,604
He has no parents!
They are dead!

853
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:22,891
That's how he lures gullible
girls into visiting his house!

854
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:27,528
And then... have you seen
the film Insaaf Ka Tarazu?

855
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:29,684
Yes, I have. So?

856
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:35,253
So it's... rape...
twice in succession!

857
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:38,998
- And then?
- It's the Courts!

858
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,380
But I've already jotted
that down, sir.

859
01:12:04,966 --> 01:12:06,359
You will have to
concede my request.

860
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:09,086
My mother has sent some
special food for you.

861
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:11,021
- Your mother has?
- That's right.

862
01:12:11,045 --> 01:12:13,393
She's a great cook!
Check it out for yourself!

863
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:16,125
I don't doubt that.
But...

864
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,301
Has someone poisoned
your ears against me?

865
01:12:18,325 --> 01:12:20,285
No...

866
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:23,725
In that case, you must
try the food.

867
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:27,043
That's a request from me
as well as my mother!

868
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:38,605
Sit down.

869
01:12:47,765 --> 01:12:51,002
- What will you have?
- Anything you wish.

870
01:12:53,655 --> 01:12:55,010
How's the restaurant?

871
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:00,393
You choose the menu today.

872
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,159
A vegetable-rice, a steamed
potato-dish...

873
01:13:06,885 --> 01:13:12,085
a radish-pancake, and
a seasoned lentil-curry.

874
01:13:14,567 --> 01:13:15,885
- Listen...
- Yes.

875
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:19,217
Also include a dish
of bitter-gourd.

876
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:21,990
Something wrong?

877
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,838
Except for the bitter-gourd,
we have common tastes!

878
01:13:29,982 --> 01:13:33,108
Do you know, when I saw you
for the first time...

879
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,624
- Where was that?
- At the interview, of course.

880
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:42,853
I had a feeling that I had
met you somewhere.

881
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:46,838
- Where could that be?
- In my dreams, perhaps.

882
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:51,263
You could really
have met me earlier...

883
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:55,315
and forgotten me like
a bad dream?

884
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,243
Perhaps. But I won't
ever forget you now.

885
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:06,940
What are you doing?
Won't you eat?

886
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,331
You finish your food first.

887
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,259
That's the worst thing
about Hindu women!

888
01:14:10,339 --> 01:14:13,018
Like my mother, for instance.
They serve others first...

889
01:14:13,098 --> 01:14:14,990
and themselves eat later.
That's not fair.

890
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,500
Who else do you have
in the family?

891
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,171
- It's just my parents and me.
- Is that all?

892
01:14:20,549 --> 01:14:23,788
Why? Must I have more?

893
01:14:25,734 --> 01:14:29,109
I see what you are
getting at. But, no...

894
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:40,038
I'm surprised that even after
so many years in England...

895
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,430
you still haven't forgotten
your old customs.

896
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,639
I haven't forgotten
anything, except...

897
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:48,228
for some terrible memories
that I want to forget.

898
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:26,964
Thank you, O Lord!

899
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:28,965
- Did you see that?
- See what?

900
01:15:29,409 --> 01:15:31,329
Amit has been whistling!

901
01:15:32,209 --> 01:15:36,378
It's a whistle of joy
and happiness...

902
01:15:36,713 --> 01:15:38,728
that which spells melody!

903
01:15:39,024 --> 01:15:41,985
It's after 2 years that
Amit has whistled again!

904
01:15:42,689 --> 01:15:46,209
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't. Please explain.

905
01:15:47,307 --> 01:15:49,047
You're an ignorant man.

906
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:53,482
Don't you remember Amit
whistling all the while...

907
01:15:53,562 --> 01:15:55,479
even as he walked,
talked and ate?

908
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,795
Since the wedding, however, he
forgot his favourite whistle.

909
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:02,346
And he has been whistling today!

910
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:04,983
Which means he is
truly delighted!

911
01:16:05,377 --> 01:16:07,031
This is when I must
talk to him...

912
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:10,184
about bringing our
daughter-in-law home!

913
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:17,412
- My son...
- Yes, Mom?

914
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:21,167
I'm delighted to see
you happy today.

915
01:16:21,846 --> 01:16:25,374
On this happy occasion then,
I've something to say to you.

916
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:29,500
- Sure. Go ahead, Mom.
- Can we bring Madhuri home?

917
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:32,490
I've forgotten the past.

918
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:34,603
I can't be blamed if it
continues to haunt you.

919
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:37,537
It isn't my fault either for
remembering the past.

920
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:41,097
I can't help it, if you
have a bad memory.

921
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,238
Do you get the point?

922
01:16:48,387 --> 01:16:50,778
When a young man whistles
after a gap of 2 years...

923
01:16:50,858 --> 01:16:52,972
it has to be for an
altogether new woman!

924
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:01,446
Come closer...

925
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,519
Why are you feeling shy?

926
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:14,498
Not at all. Why would I
come to you, if I were shy.

927
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,907
But your eyes say
something else.

928
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:19,483
I wish you'd look into them.

929
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:24,933
Your hand is freezing.

930
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,170
- What's wrong?
- I've swallowed a mosquito!

931
01:18:21,624 --> 01:18:25,206
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

932
01:18:25,628 --> 01:18:29,536
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

933
01:18:29,616 --> 01:18:33,203
"I'm afraid, someone
might see us"

934
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:37,363
"We meet here, away
from prying eyes"

935
01:18:37,443 --> 01:18:41,203
"I'm afraid, someone
might see us"

936
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,985
"A little bit of fear..."

937
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:45,255
"And the overpowering
magic of love"

938
01:18:45,563 --> 01:18:46,953
"A little bit of fear..."

939
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,469
"And the overpowering
magic of love"

940
01:18:49,549 --> 01:18:53,163
"Meeting on the sly
has its own charm"

941
01:18:53,574 --> 01:18:57,459
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

942
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:01,484
"But I'm afraid...
someone might spot us"

943
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:23,088
"No one recognise us here
in this isolated place"

944
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:31,029
"But our hearts would still
be lonely, meeting on the sly"

945
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:51,341
"The fear in your eyes
and the anxiety within"

946
01:19:51,421 --> 01:19:55,086
"The fear in your eyes
and the anxiety within"

947
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,276
"Meeting on the sly
has its own charm"

948
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:37,397
"What a great weather"

949
01:20:37,943 --> 01:20:41,333
"And the intoxicating winds..."

950
01:20:41,413 --> 01:20:44,893
"I've been longing for you"

951
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:48,811
"Oh, do sate my thirst"

952
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:08,672
"We can always meet again;
why make haste?"

953
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:12,670
"We can always meet again;
why make haste?"

954
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:16,423
"Meeting on the sly has
its own charm, after all"

955
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:20,836
"Let's continue to meet
away from prying eyes"

956
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:24,774
"But we're afraid,
someone might see us"

957
01:21:56,104 --> 01:22:03,199
"Where would these longing
hearts go anyway"

958
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:11,103
"The world is anyway
against lovers"

959
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:30,965
"Let's hide from them...
but don't hide love from me"

960
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:34,965
"Making love on the sly
has its own charm, too"

961
01:22:35,045 --> 01:22:38,577
"What do we gain from
meeting on the sly"

962
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:42,429
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

963
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:46,836
"But we're afraid,
someone might see us"

964
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:50,747
"Let's romance openly
if we must"

965
01:22:50,827 --> 01:22:54,505
"Let's romance openly
if we must"

966
01:22:54,856 --> 01:22:58,763
"Why fear the world
when we've fallen in love"

967
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:02,271
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

968
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:06,700
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

969
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:10,421
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

970
01:23:10,501 --> 01:23:14,186
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

971
01:23:14,266 --> 01:23:17,995
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

972
01:23:18,698 --> 01:23:22,024
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

973
01:23:22,104 --> 01:23:26,494
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

974
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,231
I've told you a thousand
times that you're...

975
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:54,733
making the wrong entries!

976
01:23:54,813 --> 01:23:59,682
The right total is 53987.
And you write 33987.

977
01:24:00,113 --> 01:24:01,951
Doesn't that make a
difference of 20000?

978
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:06,111
There's someone to see you, sir.

979
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:07,966
When I asked him to sit
at the reception...

980
01:24:08,046 --> 01:24:10,151
he insisted on waiting
in your cabin.

981
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:12,042
He claimed to be
a relative of yours.

982
01:24:12,122 --> 01:24:15,685
You've caught a cold, sir.
Would you want a pill?

983
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:18,271
So, haven't I told you...

984
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:25,831
You've caught a cold.
Would you want a pill...

985
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:27,831
That's not necessary.

986
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:33,070
What is it?

987
01:24:38,478 --> 01:24:39,873
I'll go and pop a pill!

988
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:18,302
Where's the guy you said
was waiting for me?

989
01:25:18,631 --> 01:25:21,231
That's what I'm wondering!
Where could he be...?

990
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:23,271
There he is!

991
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:24,981
What have you been doing
in my toilet?

992
01:25:25,986 --> 01:25:27,241
I'll leave now.

993
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:30,111
Greetings, brother-in-law!

994
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:34,191
Now tell me what would we have,
if not the Himalayas?

995
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:35,467
Himalayas, my foot!

996
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,424
And keep standing!
Don't sit down!

997
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:39,742
- Are not well?
- I've caught a cold.

998
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:40,886
You shouldn't be shouting.

999
01:25:40,966 --> 01:25:44,449
I wanted to know when you're taking
my sister away, brother-in-law.

1000
01:25:44,818 --> 01:25:47,687
To begin with, stop
calling me brother-in-law!

1001
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,780
- Okay, brother-in-law...
- There you go again!

1002
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,700
I've come to you with hopes,
brother-in-law.

1003
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,415
I thought I'd meet you and
have a chat with you!

1004
01:25:56,495 --> 01:25:58,547
That I'd have something
to drink!

1005
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:00,891
But never mind...

1006
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:04,854
I'll go and show these
pictures to your parents.

1007
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,993
There's no point in tearing
them! I have the negatives!

1008
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,849
Do you think you can
blackmail me with this?

1009
01:26:12,012 --> 01:26:14,293
Go ahead and show them to
my parents! I don't care!

1010
01:26:14,608 --> 01:26:18,594
Sure, I'll go away. But
I won't stop tailing you!

1011
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,226
Not there! This way out!

1012
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,173
I have learnt something
absolutely explosive!

1013
01:26:32,649 --> 01:26:34,480
Really? What is it?

1014
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:36,492
I will tell you
when the time comes.

1015
01:26:36,572 --> 01:26:38,482
Whom is it about?

1016
01:26:39,216 --> 01:26:43,114
It's about the boss,
Mr Amit Chaudhary.

1017
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:49,371
But I will tell you only
when the time comes!

1018
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:53,151
The right time, my foot!

1019
01:27:03,212 --> 01:27:05,115
What's wrong?
Aren't you well?

1020
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:07,085
I think I have a fever.

1021
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:08,793
You're running
a high temperature.

1022
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,910
- Come on, get up.
- Yes madam.

1023
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,830
Take this bag away.

1024
01:27:15,725 --> 01:27:18,048
- Go home and relax.
- Who'll complete my work?

1025
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:20,202
- I will.
- Okay.

1026
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,150
But call me at home, if
you have any problems.

1027
01:27:39,683 --> 01:27:42,216
Who is this girl?

1028
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:44,389
That's precisely what
I want to ask you.

1029
01:27:44,862 --> 01:27:47,838
I hope you haven't got
your son married again!

1030
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:50,160
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1031
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:55,039
this girl was clinging
to your son as if she were his wife!

1032
01:27:55,553 --> 01:27:57,078
What are you talking about?

1033
01:27:57,158 --> 01:27:58,825
They were having a ball
in the seas...

1034
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:01,958
and were even singing a duet!

1035
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:03,998
We meet on the sly,
away from prying eyes

1036
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,347
We're afraid, someone
might see us

1037
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:12,905
You should be ashamed
to accuse my son!

1038
01:28:14,425 --> 01:28:16,345
Although you are visiting
us after a long time...

1039
01:28:16,387 --> 01:28:19,010
I will not enquire
after your health!

1040
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,305
But I want to know what
insolent behaviour is this?

1041
01:28:21,525 --> 01:28:24,911
I will not tell you about
my welfare either.

1042
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:26,609
And this is no insolence!

1043
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:30,652
I've taken pictures
to back my claim!

1044
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,068
- It's Amit.
- Of course.

1045
01:28:33,148 --> 01:28:36,176
- Who's the girl?
- It's his private secretary.

1046
01:28:36,256 --> 01:28:38,736
- Miss Malti Chaudhary.
- How do you know that?

1047
01:28:40,225 --> 01:28:42,145
I had been to his office.

1048
01:28:42,994 --> 01:28:45,650
But he even refused
to acknowledge me!

1049
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:48,065
- Didn't he acknowledge you?!
- Yes, he didn't!

1050
01:28:48,145 --> 01:28:50,146
And he threw me out,
short of pushing me!

1051
01:28:50,226 --> 01:28:51,654
He dare do that!

1052
01:28:53,014 --> 01:28:54,847
It's good that he
didn't push you out.

1053
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,335
Or I'd have thrown him
out of the house!

1054
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:02,105
- You live up to my expectations!
- How is our daughter-in-law?

1055
01:29:04,496 --> 01:29:06,545
How do I tell you?

1056
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:10,636
She's miserable, thinking of
your son all the time!

1057
01:29:11,465 --> 01:29:13,705
Her hair is unruly
and uncombed...

1058
01:29:13,785 --> 01:29:15,510
her cheeks are dry!

1059
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,905
Her eye-balls seem eager to
pop out of the sockets!

1060
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:21,474
And she goes around the
village in a trance!

1061
01:29:21,554 --> 01:29:23,985
And she cries and
wants to know...

1062
01:29:24,348 --> 01:29:26,580
why her husband
has deserted her!

1063
01:29:27,114 --> 01:29:32,061
He will come, won't he?
Won't he accept me she asks!

1064
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:39,301
Hey, stop it...
Don't cry.

1065
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:45,045
Stop crying, Shreekant!
He will certainly accept her!

1066
01:29:46,585 --> 01:29:50,471
I will deal with the ass now!

1067
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:57,504
If I don't impose a curfew
on his love-affair...

1068
01:29:57,724 --> 01:30:00,035
I won't claim to be
a good husband!

1069
01:30:00,398 --> 01:30:02,815
Go on now and continue
playing the private-eye.

1070
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:08,465
Let me know, if you
smell something fishy.

1071
01:30:08,902 --> 01:30:15,857
Only you can save my sister's
life from ruination, sir!

1072
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:20,334
Or your son is making
attempt to destroy her!

1073
01:30:20,836 --> 01:30:24,375
I must leave now.
Good-bye!

1074
01:30:31,288 --> 01:30:36,425
Why did you attend office,
when you aren't keeping well?

1075
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:39,609
How'd I have met you, if
I didn't attend office?

1076
01:30:40,148 --> 01:30:44,308
You don't have to attend
office till I come, too.

1077
01:30:44,388 --> 01:30:48,134
How can I possibly bunk office?

1078
01:30:48,214 --> 01:30:52,291
Very well. But do call me
from the office.

1079
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,519
- You will call me, won't you?
- Sure, I will.

1080
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:06,603
What will happen now.

1081
01:31:07,315 --> 01:31:09,563
- A wedding.
- What?

1082
01:31:10,184 --> 01:31:13,457
If Amit loves that girl, he'll
surely want to marry her.

1083
01:31:13,537 --> 01:31:15,244
I'll throw him out of
the house for that!

1084
01:31:15,568 --> 01:31:17,117
The ant has sprouted wings!

1085
01:31:19,664 --> 01:31:22,123
That sounds like Amit's car.
But at this hour?

1086
01:31:32,425 --> 01:31:36,612
There's a girl with Amit.
Can you see?

1087
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:39,095
How can I? I'm not
wearing my glasses!

1088
01:31:39,175 --> 01:31:41,664
I can't see properly
without my glasses either.

1089
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:44,926
But I'm sure it's
the same wretch!

1090
01:31:56,507 --> 01:31:58,028
What's wrong, son?

1091
01:31:58,706 --> 01:32:01,262
You're running a temperature!
Come along quickly...

1092
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:05,914
Lie down on the bed.

1093
01:32:09,933 --> 01:32:13,487
Call the doctor.
My condition is worsening.

1094
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:15,022
Yes, I will.

1095
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:18,523
But who was the girl
with you, Amit?

1096
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:22,442
It was my secretary.

1097
01:32:22,522 --> 01:32:26,903
She came to drop me home,
because I wasn't well.

1098
01:32:28,311 --> 01:32:31,809
You could have called
us over to fetch you.

1099
01:32:35,102 --> 01:32:36,876
Greetings, sir.
The keys.

1100
01:32:37,187 --> 01:32:39,437
Who was the girl, Biharilal?

1101
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:44,374
Who was she?

1102
01:32:44,798 --> 01:32:47,146
It was Miss Malti.
The master's private.

1103
01:32:47,226 --> 01:32:50,885
- Private what?
- His private secretary.

1104
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:53,782
What were they discussing
in the car?

1105
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:58,250
Don't feel shy. Tell us what
they were talking about.

1106
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:00,613
I couldn't hear them well.

1107
01:33:00,693 --> 01:33:04,688
But the master called her
by the name Darjeeling.

1108
01:33:04,882 --> 01:33:07,697
Could they be going
to Darjeeling then?

1109
01:33:07,777 --> 01:33:09,821
Shut up! You're an idiot!

1110
01:33:10,504 --> 01:33:12,775
He's called her a darling!

1111
01:33:13,328 --> 01:33:16,222
Did you see anything
for yourself, Biharilal?

1112
01:33:16,302 --> 01:33:21,096
I could watch them in the
rear-view mirror, madam.

1113
01:33:21,534 --> 01:33:25,793
The young master lay in
the girl's lap!

1114
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:32,040
The lady was muttering
sweet-nothings to him...

1115
01:33:32,568 --> 01:33:36,615
while the master's
temperature kept increasing...

1116
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:40,650
and I kept feeling embarrassed!

1117
01:33:40,935 --> 01:33:46,390
- What happened then?
- The master then gave it to her.

1118
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:48,087
- What?
- Two time.

1119
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:49,405
Twice kissed.

1120
01:33:49,485 --> 01:33:51,055
- Gave what?
- Don't you understand?

1121
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,815
Your son has kissed her!

1122
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:59,602
- She dare do that!
- How's the girl to blame?

1123
01:33:59,682 --> 01:34:01,247
It was your son who kissed her!

1124
01:34:01,327 --> 01:34:04,453
The question is why did she
allow him to kiss her?

1125
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:09,170
And why did this idiot
watch them kissing?!

1126
01:34:09,735 --> 01:34:14,055
Let me deal with you,
you peeping-tom...

1127
01:34:18,031 --> 01:34:21,771
Who's Malti Chaudhary
in this office?

1128
01:34:21,851 --> 01:34:23,161
Malti?

1129
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:27,398
- Who are you, sir?
- And who are you?

1130
01:34:28,034 --> 01:34:30,758
Kumar Chatterji, the chief
accountant of this company.

1131
01:34:30,838 --> 01:34:32,001
- Chief accountant?
- Yes.

1132
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:34,073
My name is Sadanand Chaudhary.

1133
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:40,418
The boss's father?
Greetings, sir.

1134
01:34:40,498 --> 01:34:42,201
I want to meet Malti Chaudhary.

1135
01:34:42,356 --> 01:34:44,576
She's in her cabin.
Please follow me.

1136
01:34:51,193 --> 01:34:55,148
She seems to have
gone out on some work.

1137
01:34:55,228 --> 01:34:59,257
But do sit inside
and wait for her.

1138
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,557
Please sit down.
You too, madam.

1139
01:35:05,354 --> 01:35:08,099
I want to ask you
something, Chatterji.

1140
01:35:08,179 --> 01:35:11,257
I'll explain everything
without any questions.

1141
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:13,518
I've spread the word of
your son's love-affair...

1142
01:35:13,598 --> 01:35:15,478
in the whole city!

1143
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:18,290
Since when has this
affair been going on?

1144
01:35:18,314 --> 01:35:19,945
Since it began, sir.

1145
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,794
- And when did it begin?
- Since it got going.

1146
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,456
That woman, who has
enticed my son...

1147
01:35:25,536 --> 01:35:27,758
has she been into this sort
of a thing even earlier?

1148
01:35:28,236 --> 01:35:31,250
You're mistaken, madam.

1149
01:35:31,614 --> 01:35:33,110
There's nothing wrong
with the girl.

1150
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,678
In fact, she was madly
in love with me.

1151
01:35:36,154 --> 01:35:37,814
It was your son Amit...

1152
01:35:38,318 --> 01:35:41,784
who threatened me with a
transfer to Nicobar Islands...

1153
01:35:42,048 --> 01:35:43,860
and won the game by
unfair means!

1154
01:35:45,611 --> 01:35:48,290
It is I who will send the
girl to the back-waters!

1155
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:52,156
You will be happy to know,
Mr Chatterjee, that...

1156
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:56,002
I'm not against occasionally
beating up silly women!

1157
01:35:56,266 --> 01:35:57,594
- Am I not right?
- Nonsense!

1158
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:59,785
It's always the men
who are at fault!

1159
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:03,339
- It's they who deserve a thrashing!
- You're right, madam!

1160
01:36:03,419 --> 01:36:05,829
It's the boss who ought
to be beaten up!

1161
01:36:06,146 --> 01:36:08,909
As for Malti Chaudhary...
I'll handle her myself!

1162
01:36:09,322 --> 01:36:10,536
Well, all right.

1163
01:36:10,985 --> 01:36:14,708
Do warn Malti Chaudhary then,
that if she doesn't relent...

1164
01:36:14,998 --> 01:36:16,485
I'll make life difficult
for her!

1165
01:36:30,575 --> 01:36:32,845
What are you weighing
in the scale?

1166
01:36:33,085 --> 01:36:35,159
The pros and cons, naturally!

1167
01:36:36,027 --> 01:36:37,462
Won't you listen to me?

1168
01:36:40,288 --> 01:36:42,890
My in-laws visited the
office today.

1169
01:36:43,414 --> 01:36:44,702
And from what I've heard...

1170
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:47,961
they're longing for their
daughter-in-law.

1171
01:36:50,616 --> 01:36:52,539
I don't like this anymore!

1172
01:36:53,123 --> 01:36:55,378
Tell me, Shreekant...

1173
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:59,284
why must we punish them,
when they are innocent?

1174
01:36:59,725 --> 01:37:02,397
You are right!

1175
01:37:02,687 --> 01:37:04,402
- What do you mean?
- All I mean is that...

1176
01:37:04,482 --> 01:37:07,656
had you not been secretary
to him, someone else would.

1177
01:37:07,736 --> 01:37:09,056
And whoever she
might have been...

1178
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:11,125
she'd have weighed
heavier on his mind!

1179
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,832
Somewhat like this!

1180
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:20,074
You have the upper hand today
because he's smitten by you.

1181
01:37:22,007 --> 01:37:25,448
Or else, he'd have fallen
for another woman by now.

1182
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:30,241
Let's continue with the game.

1183
01:37:30,849 --> 01:37:33,942
There are many days and
nights yet to come.

1184
01:37:34,622 --> 01:37:36,206
There's a lot to speak about.

1185
01:37:49,412 --> 01:37:51,652
- Is the driver here, Ramu?
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:37:51,959 --> 01:37:53,384
But the Master's
taking the car away.

1187
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,667
- Where to?
- Nirmal Village.

1188
01:37:54,747 --> 01:37:55,432
- Chandanpur?
- Yes.

1189
01:37:55,512 --> 01:37:58,520
Yes. I suggest you take
leave, and accompany us.

1190
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,345
- What for?
- To bring your wife home.

1191
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:02,334
What's made you decide
this, all of a sudden?

1192
01:38:02,358 --> 01:38:04,380
It wasn't sudden.
We made the decision...

1193
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,415
only after hearing a lot and
seeing it for ourselves, too!

1194
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:08,642
Sure. Go ahead.

1195
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:11,598
I must attend the office
to check the accounts.

1196
01:38:11,678 --> 01:38:14,147
I've already checked that out
at your office yesterday!

1197
01:38:14,412 --> 01:38:16,922
They don't speak highly of
you; in fact, you're infamous!

1198
01:38:17,138 --> 01:38:19,578
You'd better correct that or
the company stands to lose a lot!

1199
01:38:19,871 --> 01:38:23,786
We'll go ahead, if you
don't want to come along.

1200
01:38:23,866 --> 01:38:24,866
Let's go.

1201
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:30,491
Daughter-in-law, my foot!

1202
01:38:45,745 --> 01:38:49,729
- What are you dressed in?
- I want to marry you!

1203
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:51,862
- What?!
- Yes! Right now!

1204
01:38:52,749 --> 01:38:56,849
Right now? But I'd have to
seek my parents' consent.

1205
01:38:56,929 --> 01:39:00,087
Introduce me to them.
Everything's going haywire!

1206
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:03,323
- Haywire?!
- Yes! I can't wait anymore!

1207
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,473
Won't you seek the blessings
of your own parents, then?

1208
01:39:05,497 --> 01:39:08,030
I'll manage with your
parents' blessings!

1209
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,640
So when are you introducing
me to them?

1210
01:39:10,132 --> 01:39:13,547
- I'd have to find them, I guess...
- Find them?!

1211
01:39:13,627 --> 01:39:16,845
They must've gone shopping.
But I'll find them.

1212
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:21,385
I'll come at 6 this evening
to meet them then, okay?

1213
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:32,979
Have you spent the night
at the office, sir?

1214
01:39:33,436 --> 01:39:36,383
Why are you in your
night-dress, sir?

1215
01:39:40,113 --> 01:39:44,410
Your in-laws have gone to the village
to bring you home?

1216
01:39:45,002 --> 01:39:47,021
And your husband is
coming here...

1217
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:49,073
to meet your so-called
parents, right?

1218
01:39:49,289 --> 01:39:51,002
What will we do now?

1219
01:39:51,392 --> 01:39:55,559
If both secrets are out,
all hell will break loose!

1220
01:39:58,712 --> 01:40:00,193
Don't worry!

1221
01:40:00,273 --> 01:40:03,734
I suggest you handle
your husband.

1222
01:40:03,814 --> 01:40:07,747
You're a great actress anyway!

1223
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:12,190
And I'll handle the
problem in the village.

1224
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:14,917
- What do you think of that?
- That's okay.

1225
01:40:14,997 --> 01:40:16,932
But where will I find
a fake-Mom from?

1226
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:20,381
There's a solution
to every problem!

1227
01:40:20,461 --> 01:40:23,513
When everything in the city
is available on hire...

1228
01:40:23,593 --> 01:40:25,853
won't we find a pair of parents?

1229
01:40:34,985 --> 01:40:36,032
Please come...

1230
01:40:39,841 --> 01:40:41,169
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1231
01:40:41,249 --> 01:40:44,416
Kantibhai! He has arrived!

1232
01:40:51,409 --> 01:40:52,491
Greetings...

1233
01:40:55,712 --> 01:40:57,375
How are you?

1234
01:40:59,187 --> 01:41:06,841
Where has she gone...?
She's a strange woman!

1235
01:41:07,466 --> 01:41:10,483
Kantibhai...!

1236
01:41:10,563 --> 01:41:13,175
Where the hell are you?

1237
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:22,350
Where are you?

1238
01:41:37,468 --> 01:41:40,070
They appear to be brother and sister.
And where are your parents?

1239
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:44,087
They're are my parents!
My mother is a Gujarati...

1240
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:46,748
which is why she addresses
him as bhai (brother).

1241
01:41:47,486 --> 01:41:49,562
- Are you a Guajarati then?
- Yes.

1242
01:41:49,642 --> 01:41:52,210
My Mom is Guajarati;
my father is a Bengali.

1243
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,639
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1244
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:03,970
- Do sit down...
- Please sit.

1245
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:06,323
Sit on this chair.

1246
01:42:17,866 --> 01:42:19,238
Evening is all right!

1247
01:42:20,787 --> 01:42:24,262
You're just as my daughter
described you!

1248
01:42:24,342 --> 01:42:26,690
Tall and fair-skinned;
those blue eyes...

1249
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:29,724
they remind me of
film-star Raj Kapoor!

1250
01:42:31,325 --> 01:42:33,905
Our daughter is no less!

1251
01:42:34,307 --> 01:42:36,996
She's fair-skinned
and beautiful...

1252
01:42:37,076 --> 01:42:39,058
a real princess!

1253
01:42:42,747 --> 01:42:46,025
Do you know what is
special about you?

1254
01:42:46,478 --> 01:42:52,177
It's your moustache!
It's real, isn't it?

1255
01:42:52,257 --> 01:42:54,557
Of course! As real
as yours!

1256
01:42:56,779 --> 01:42:58,735
Mine are real, too!

1257
01:42:58,815 --> 01:43:01,206
That's because my wife
loves a moustache!

1258
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,665
Undoubtedly! A moustache
spells masculinity.

1259
01:43:05,211 --> 01:43:09,530
I married Kantibhai only
because he had a moustache.

1260
01:43:09,722 --> 01:43:12,837
And since you have a moustache, too
my daughter has approved of you!

1261
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:15,190
We will certainly give you
our daughter in marriage!

1262
01:43:15,382 --> 01:43:17,246
But you will be a responsible
man, won't you?

1263
01:43:17,326 --> 01:43:19,542
Of course! I will!

1264
01:43:20,357 --> 01:43:22,158
How much of a bank-balance
do you have?

1265
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:24,138
My bank-balance? What for?

1266
01:43:24,616 --> 01:43:27,726
It has to do with responsibilities.
Only a moustache won't do!

1267
01:43:30,168 --> 01:43:31,985
I must have about
3 or 3.5 lakh Rupees.

1268
01:43:32,065 --> 01:43:34,490
- Not 4.5 lakh Rupees?
- Sure. Must be.

1269
01:43:38,383 --> 01:43:41,993
He has about 4.5 lakh Rupees.
We can easily ask for 80000 Rupees!

1270
01:43:42,073 --> 01:43:45,208
- No! We need a lakh!
- Let's settle for 80000!

1271
01:43:45,288 --> 01:43:48,581
- Well okay. One lakh, it will be.
- A lakh? What could that mean?

1272
01:43:48,772 --> 01:43:53,108
A lakh must be paid, since you're
marrying our daughter.

1273
01:43:53,188 --> 01:43:55,378
No thank you! I will
not accept a penny!

1274
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:59,498
Not accept! You will have
to pay us a lakh instead!

1275
01:44:04,248 --> 01:44:05,317
Pay you?!

1276
01:44:05,397 --> 01:44:08,576
As dowry. How can there be
a marriage without dowry?

1277
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:10,617
This is a totally wrong system!

1278
01:44:10,697 --> 01:44:12,607
On the contrary, you
ought to be happy...

1279
01:44:12,687 --> 01:44:15,545
that I'm willing to marry your
daughter without any dowry.

1280
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:17,697
And here you are... asking me
to pay the dowry!

1281
01:44:19,527 --> 01:44:21,836
What are you talking
about, Mom?!

1282
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:24,390
We're marrying since
we love each other!

1283
01:44:26,256 --> 01:44:30,907
Haven't we toiled to
bring you up, my dear?

1284
01:44:31,754 --> 01:44:34,437
Do you wish to light up your
house after your marriage...

1285
01:44:34,711 --> 01:44:36,667
and plunge our home in darkness?

1286
01:44:37,138 --> 01:44:38,813
- A lakh of Rupees!
- A lakh?

1287
01:44:38,893 --> 01:44:41,311
Or 50 thousand cash and 200
gram gold.

1288
01:44:41,705 --> 01:44:43,774
If have then give it or get go.

1289
01:44:43,854 --> 01:44:48,567
Radhe Shyam Jhunghun's son has ready
to give 2 lakh rupees for our daughter.

1290
01:44:48,647 --> 01:44:50,264
- Am I right, darling?
- Yes.

1291
01:44:52,592 --> 01:44:56,041
It's a very reasonable deal!
Grab it!

1292
01:44:56,463 --> 01:45:00,032
- That's not much for love, is it?
- Do you believe that, too?

1293
01:45:00,602 --> 01:45:04,557
Actually, to accept dowry is
considered a social crime.

1294
01:45:04,825 --> 01:45:07,534
Besides, we love each other.

1295
01:45:08,653 --> 01:45:10,667
We'll give you a 10/o
discount, in that case.

1296
01:45:12,356 --> 01:45:15,833
I know it's a crime to
ask for dowry, son.

1297
01:45:15,913 --> 01:45:19,796
I know that very well
because I'm a woman!

1298
01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:24,055
I know how the cancer of
dowry is destroying us!

1299
01:45:24,421 --> 01:45:27,243
Our parents are coerced
into paying dowry!

1300
01:45:27,323 --> 01:45:30,255
And thereafter begins
a sage of atrocities!

1301
01:45:30,551 --> 01:45:34,598
What is that for? Because men
consider women to be worth nothing!

1302
01:45:34,678 --> 01:45:39,370
You think women are weak
and helpless parasites!

1303
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:43,303
But it's not true!
We will prove otherwise!

1304
01:45:45,366 --> 01:45:50,335
We will prove that women are
not weak and helpless!

1305
01:45:50,415 --> 01:45:53,309
Long live, Women's Lib!

1306
01:46:00,107 --> 01:46:01,033
Well, all right!

1307
01:46:01,113 --> 01:46:04,829
Please give me some time
to think it over.

1308
01:46:08,783 --> 01:46:11,287
Listen to me, darling.

1309
01:46:11,367 --> 01:46:13,806
Don't take offence at what
my parents said!

1310
01:46:13,886 --> 01:46:18,927
Don't take offence?! Your father's
a butcher, as far as money goes!

1311
01:46:20,335 --> 01:46:23,589
How can I help it?
That's how all parents are!

1312
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:27,188
Why I can't figure this out is
because ours is a different case!

1313
01:46:27,268 --> 01:46:31,357
There's no money
in a love-marriage!

1314
01:46:31,674 --> 01:46:35,029
You don't know my old man!
He wouldn't part with a penny!

1315
01:46:35,109 --> 01:46:36,804
But if you want to marry me...

1316
01:46:36,884 --> 01:46:38,970
you'll have to agree to the
conditions of my parents.

1317
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,727
I suggest you find
a part-time job.

1318
01:46:41,807 --> 01:46:43,946
I? A part-time job?

1319
01:46:44,378 --> 01:46:47,589
They're the only parents I have!

1320
01:46:47,669 --> 01:46:49,496
Besides, what don't people
do in love?

1321
01:46:50,035 --> 01:46:51,983
Can't you do even
this much for me?

1322
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,550
Sure, I will.
I will have to!

1323
01:47:21,193 --> 01:47:23,405
- Where could they have gone?
- How would I know!

1324
01:47:23,485 --> 01:47:25,583
Mr Chaudhary?! Greetings!

1325
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:28,270
What brings you here?

1326
01:47:29,537 --> 01:47:31,801
Where have they gone, Teacher?

1327
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:33,671
How do I narrate their
tale of woes.

1328
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:36,890
Ever since that shameful day...

1329
01:47:37,629 --> 01:47:39,996
Madhuri and her mother
left the village for good.

1330
01:47:40,076 --> 01:47:41,629
For good?!

1331
01:47:41,709 --> 01:47:43,726
After the humiliation they
were subjected to...

1332
01:47:43,806 --> 01:47:45,723
they chose to leave the village.

1333
01:47:45,803 --> 01:47:47,816
They should have died
of shame, actually!

1334
01:47:47,896 --> 01:47:51,609
No! Please don't say that!
Shreekant called on us in the city.

1335
01:47:51,689 --> 01:47:53,517
But he didn't tell us
a word of this.

1336
01:47:55,514 --> 01:47:59,860
See the lock your jokes
have put on the door!

1337
01:48:00,194 --> 01:48:03,246
Do you have the keys
to unlock it then?

1338
01:48:03,589 --> 01:48:05,877
It will never open again!

1339
01:48:06,273 --> 01:48:07,654
You can open locks
made of iron...

1340
01:48:07,734 --> 01:48:11,214
but never one that opens
the doors to the hearts!

1341
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:39,220
Come on out.

1342
01:48:43,513 --> 01:48:46,813
What farce is Shreekant playing?

1343
01:48:46,893 --> 01:48:48,951
My daughter's in-laws have
returned from our door!

1344
01:48:49,031 --> 01:48:53,737
They had once returned because
their son asked them to.

1345
01:48:54,318 --> 01:48:56,881
And they return today,
since your son wants them to.

1346
01:48:57,221 --> 01:48:58,531
Let's go inside.

1347
01:49:01,769 --> 01:49:02,895
Thanks a lot, Teacher.

1348
01:49:07,592 --> 01:49:11,586
I was looking for you!
Here's a bouquet!

1349
01:49:11,964 --> 01:49:13,363
What's up?

1350
01:49:13,574 --> 01:49:17,199
How have got to the bouquet
from a single rose?

1351
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:21,459
For what the boss has done,
you deserve a bouquet!

1352
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:24,518
And I also want to
congratulate you!

1353
01:49:24,598 --> 01:49:26,761
- What for?
- I'll explain.

1354
01:49:29,348 --> 01:49:33,113
Amit has lost! I've won the
day! And you're a free bird!

1355
01:49:33,377 --> 01:49:35,492
I wasn't a captive earlier,
was I?

1356
01:49:35,572 --> 01:49:38,723
It is something of the sort.
I'll explain. Sit down.

1357
01:49:40,856 --> 01:49:44,972
Amit wanted to imprison
you in a marriage...

1358
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:47,972
and wanted to have
all the fun by himself!

1359
01:49:48,052 --> 01:49:50,932
But his plans have flopped!
Do you know why?

1360
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:54,317
Because he's already
a married man!

1361
01:49:54,818 --> 01:49:57,634
His brother-in-law came here
to meet him the other day.

1362
01:49:57,714 --> 01:50:00,372
And without even divorcing
the village belle...

1363
01:50:00,452 --> 01:50:02,774
the rascal's trying to
lure you into wedlock!

1364
01:50:03,518 --> 01:50:06,535
We are both free now!

1365
01:50:06,615 --> 01:50:11,320
The love-story that had
just begun will now blossom!

1366
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,683
But remember! I will not
spare the hypocrite!

1367
01:50:16,449 --> 01:50:19,256
I am throwing a party
tomorrow to expose him!

1368
01:50:19,336 --> 01:50:22,106
And on the occasion of his
fourth wedding anniversary...

1369
01:50:22,186 --> 01:50:24,806
you will see how the
guests ridicule him!

1370
01:50:26,997 --> 01:50:28,678
What are you getting
angry at me for?

1371
01:50:28,758 --> 01:50:32,927
You should be angry
with the fraud, who...

1372
01:50:35,364 --> 01:50:37,852
I'm coming over.

1373
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:45,570
Let's continue playing
the game, sister.

1374
01:50:45,650 --> 01:50:48,315
There's a lot more yet to come.

1375
01:50:48,763 --> 01:50:50,620
A lot more to discuss.

1376
01:50:55,336 --> 01:50:57,178
"What was he in reality..."

1377
01:50:57,258 --> 01:51:01,881
"And what did I take him for"

1378
01:51:08,974 --> 01:51:15,548
"How could I revere
a stone-hearted man?"

1379
01:51:15,628 --> 01:51:17,704
"What was he in reality"

1380
01:51:17,784 --> 01:51:22,008
"And what did take him for"

1381
01:51:42,934 --> 01:51:49,464
"All he wanted to do was
to play with my feelings"

1382
01:51:52,902 --> 01:51:58,832
"All he wanted to do was
to play with my feelings"

1383
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:05,667
"And I thought I was
betrothed to him for life"

1384
01:52:05,747 --> 01:52:07,322
"What was he in reality"

1385
01:52:07,402 --> 01:52:12,006
"And what did I take him for"

1386
01:52:36,119 --> 01:52:42,046
"The face was supposed to
reflect a man's heart"

1387
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:51,978
"The face was supposed to
reflect a man's heart"

1388
01:52:52,233 --> 01:52:58,857
"I mistook every expression
that his face registered"

1389
01:52:58,937 --> 01:53:00,388
"What was he in reality"

1390
01:53:00,468 --> 01:53:05,034
"And what did I take him for"

1391
01:53:26,085 --> 01:53:32,438
"I lost everything and was
still heart-broken"

1392
01:53:36,001 --> 01:53:41,763
"I lost everything and was
still heart-broken"

1393
01:53:42,142 --> 01:53:48,606
"And I took the pain
as a gift of love"

1394
01:53:48,686 --> 01:53:50,910
"What was he in reality"

1395
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:54,855
"And what did I take him for"

1396
01:53:55,321 --> 01:54:01,796
"How could I revere
a stone-hearted man"

1397
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:03,920
"What was he in reality"

1398
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,140
"And what did I take him for"

1399
01:54:08,395 --> 01:54:10,621
"What was he in reality"

1400
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:15,204
"And what did I take him for"

1401
01:54:17,712 --> 01:54:19,452
Get up, brother-in-law.

1402
01:54:19,902 --> 01:54:23,625
Let me rest. My son has
laid me out flat!

1403
01:54:23,976 --> 01:54:26,548
Your wife wants to touch your feet,
today being the Karva Chauth day.

1404
01:54:26,572 --> 01:54:27,941
Very well.

1405
01:54:28,405 --> 01:54:30,874
This is the only day I get
her to touch my feet!

1406
01:54:31,393 --> 01:54:33,064
Bless you with
all the happiness!

1407
01:54:34,366 --> 01:54:36,592
My son was the rose who
has now become a thorn.

1408
01:54:37,885 --> 01:54:39,574
Today is the day of the
Karva Chauth fast.

1409
01:54:40,049 --> 01:54:43,894
Had Madhuri been here,
we've have been together...

1410
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:48,120
Anyway... we're going
to the temple.

1411
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:52,683
Sure. And pray that
you're together next year.

1412
01:54:54,486 --> 01:54:56,941
You haven't touched my
feet, Saraswati!

1413
01:54:57,161 --> 01:54:59,554
Today's not Holi!
It's Karva Chauth.

1414
01:54:59,634 --> 01:55:01,677
I have my husband's picture
with me, although he's away.

1415
01:55:01,701 --> 01:55:04,564
I'll pay my respects to him.
Let's go.

1416
01:55:05,311 --> 01:55:07,021
Great is Indian culture!

1417
01:55:07,388 --> 01:55:09,306
If not man, his picture will do!

1418
01:55:19,361 --> 01:55:22,633
- Look at that, sister!
- What is it?

1419
01:55:23,345 --> 01:55:24,621
There! Right in the front!

1420
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,841
Why don't you wear your glasses?

1421
01:55:29,179 --> 01:55:30,490
What is it?

1422
01:55:30,763 --> 01:55:33,182
There's a girl with Amit's
picture in her hand.

1423
01:55:42,154 --> 01:55:47,089
I think it's the same girl
Amit's in love with.

1424
01:55:48,532 --> 01:55:51,893
I suspect Amit has
married her on the sly.

1425
01:55:52,324 --> 01:55:53,476
That's possible!

1426
01:55:53,872 --> 01:55:56,889
Or what would the wretch be
doing here on this day?

1427
01:55:57,699 --> 01:56:00,523
Let's go! I'll teach her
a lesson today!

1428
01:56:11,308 --> 01:56:12,487
Mother!

1429
01:56:13,754 --> 01:56:17,554
Madhuri! It's you?!

1430
01:56:20,177 --> 01:56:23,239
When did you come to Bombay?
You didn't even inform me!

1431
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:26,024
How have you been?
Where are you staying?

1432
01:56:26,368 --> 01:56:30,941
It's your blessing that has
me happy wherever I am.

1433
01:56:32,137 --> 01:56:35,922
This is my daughter-in-law,
Saraswati.

1434
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:38,987
Although my son has
not accepted her...

1435
01:56:39,497 --> 01:56:41,775
she still revers her husband
on this day!

1436
01:56:42,325 --> 01:56:45,141
This is my sister, Saraswati.

1437
01:56:45,505 --> 01:56:46,742
- Hello, aunty.
- Bless you.

1438
01:56:46,822 --> 01:56:50,577
Am I not unfortunate to
have such a useless son!

1439
01:56:50,994 --> 01:56:52,780
He has forsaken a beautiful
wife like you...

1440
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:55,197
and is lusting after
the city-bred girls!

1441
01:56:57,442 --> 01:57:02,870
It's true. Although it's shameful,
it's necessary to inform you.

1442
01:57:03,283 --> 01:57:06,177
Amit is caught in the clutches
of a secretary in his office.

1443
01:57:06,714 --> 01:57:08,790
While you are doing your
duty as a wife...

1444
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:11,977
that man is enticed
by a shameless wretch!

1445
01:57:12,352 --> 01:57:14,119
This is the sign of
impending doom!

1446
01:57:14,913 --> 01:57:16,049
No, Saraswati!

1447
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:19,893
Now that we've found her,
we will not let that happen!

1448
01:57:20,914 --> 01:57:23,288
Come home with me, Madhuri.

1449
01:57:23,651 --> 01:57:26,980
Let's take a decision
on this day!

1450
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,381
I beg of you! Save Amit
from this destruction!

1451
01:57:30,461 --> 01:57:34,257
Please don't worry, Mother.

1452
01:57:34,481 --> 01:57:36,311
Everything is okay, by
the grace of God.

1453
01:57:40,138 --> 01:57:43,200
The woman who has enticed
your son in her trap...

1454
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:46,921
is none other than me.

1455
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:54,690
You? Are you Amit's private
secretary, Malti Chaudhary?

1456
01:57:54,989 --> 01:57:59,326
Yes. I'm Madhuri...
and also Malti.

1457
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,693
How did you work this miracle?

1458
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,152
It is the result of a woman's
sincerity and dedication.

1459
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,189
I had made up my mind, that
should I have the strength...

1460
01:58:10,269 --> 01:58:12,847
and should my marriage
be sacred...

1461
01:58:12,927 --> 01:58:15,187
my husband would himself
come back to me.

1462
01:58:16,463 --> 01:58:18,363
And that is what has happened.

1463
01:58:18,953 --> 01:58:22,744
I always knew that you and
your husband dote on me.

1464
01:58:23,378 --> 01:58:28,569
But I was scared whether
my husband would accept me.

1465
01:58:29,343 --> 01:58:31,964
But I've had enough of this now.

1466
01:58:32,404 --> 01:58:35,017
- Please take me to my house.
- No, my dear.

1467
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:40,868
The game isn't over as yet.
Our husbands are yet to be punished.

1468
01:58:41,738 --> 01:58:44,202
My husband has played
practical jokes all his life.

1469
01:58:44,651 --> 01:58:48,074
In fact, he reduced our
lives to a cheap joke.

1470
01:58:48,787 --> 01:58:55,104
And my son kept looking for
wisdom, through his glasses.

1471
01:58:55,438 --> 01:58:57,717
Be patient, Madhuri.

1472
01:58:58,051 --> 01:59:02,828
Let us both teach our
husbands a lesson!

1473
01:59:03,426 --> 01:59:05,942
Let's shake hands on that,
daughter-in-law! Go on!

1474
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:47,913
Is the cold war between
father and son still on?

1475
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:51,450
Must you show how silly you
are, the moment you arrive?

1476
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:55,545
Do I? You're the sensible ones!
You will learn a lesson now!

1477
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:57,278
What kind of a wife are you?

1478
01:59:58,018 --> 01:59:59,994
You're always rubbing salt
in my wounds!

1479
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:05,876
You deserved to be thrown in a sea
of salt for what you've done!

1480
02:00:14,431 --> 02:00:15,431
Who's that?

1481
02:00:15,662 --> 02:00:20,057
This is his private secretary
Miss Malti Chaudhary.

1482
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,272
Malti Chaudhary?!

1483
02:00:22,509 --> 02:00:27,290
So you are the wretch who's
trying to rape my son!

1484
02:00:29,134 --> 02:00:31,351
How's Amit keeping now?

1485
02:00:31,527 --> 02:00:35,346
Don't you know?
He died of a heart-failure!

1486
02:00:35,426 --> 02:00:37,827
God-forbid! What nonsense!

1487
02:00:38,812 --> 02:00:42,093
- Let me speak to her...
- No! I won't!

1488
02:00:42,173 --> 02:00:43,730
Go away!

1489
02:00:44,969 --> 02:00:47,908
Haven't you disconnected
as yet, you wretch!

1490
02:00:49,773 --> 02:00:53,011
How can you say that,
father-in-law?

1491
02:00:53,249 --> 02:00:56,169
I'm still trying to connect...

1492
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,861
and you're talking of
disconnecting!

1493
02:01:00,049 --> 02:01:02,437
Don't you dare call me
father-in-law!

1494
02:01:03,075 --> 02:01:06,268
Bloody sinner!
Bloody lady bandit!

1495
02:01:06,348 --> 02:01:09,629
Listen carefully to me!

1496
02:01:10,133 --> 02:01:12,619
Should you even dare
to look at my son...

1497
02:01:13,313 --> 02:01:16,950
I'll use hired goons to
hack you to pieces!

1498
02:01:17,172 --> 02:01:21,031
You're a liar, father-in-law!

1499
02:01:21,963 --> 02:01:24,089
You call me father-in-law
again! What do you mean?

1500
02:01:24,169 --> 02:01:27,268
Didn't you lie that
Amit is dead?

1501
02:01:28,377 --> 02:01:30,677
I'm alive, darling!

1502
02:01:30,757 --> 02:01:33,517
Our love is alive, too!
No one can separate us!

1503
02:01:33,885 --> 02:01:35,729
Who's that speaking on the line?

1504
02:01:35,809 --> 02:01:37,729
Can't you hear me speaking
to the wretched woman?

1505
02:01:38,134 --> 02:01:42,511
You witch! Sorceress!
Bloody bandit!

1506
02:01:43,008 --> 02:01:46,539
Amit is as good as dead for you!

1507
02:01:49,036 --> 02:01:51,779
This is a cross-connection!
Just hang up!

1508
02:01:52,702 --> 02:01:55,888
So what were you saying,
you cursed woman?

1509
02:01:56,637 --> 02:02:01,084
All I want to tell you,
father-in-law...

1510
02:02:01,164 --> 02:02:03,106
is the truth that love is blind!

1511
02:02:03,186 --> 02:02:06,295
- You're right!
- Right, my foot!

1512
02:02:06,847 --> 02:02:11,457
Aren't you ashamed
to eavesdrop on us?

1513
02:02:11,651 --> 02:02:15,637
So what did you say?
That love is blind, eh?

1514
02:02:15,908 --> 02:02:18,453
That could be the case.
But I'm not blind!

1515
02:02:18,838 --> 02:02:22,358
If a whore dares eye my son...

1516
02:02:22,664 --> 02:02:24,767
I'll have her eyes pulled
out of the sockets!

1517
02:02:26,289 --> 02:02:28,981
Why must you take the trouble?

1518
02:02:29,219 --> 02:02:32,582
If my love is true...

1519
02:02:32,662 --> 02:02:38,403
I will send my eyes to you
on a platter!

1520
02:02:38,483 --> 02:02:40,007
Very well. Have them
sent by this evening.

1521
02:02:40,031 --> 02:02:44,834
Don't do that! It will
plunge my world in darkness!

1522
02:02:46,444 --> 02:02:48,063
Now listen, you cursed woman!

1523
02:02:48,143 --> 02:02:51,437
We will very soon bring our
daughter-in-law home...

1524
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,883
and have her compete with you
in a beauty-contest!

1525
02:02:54,107 --> 02:02:55,681
Just you wait!

1526
02:02:57,819 --> 02:03:02,025
I can't wait.
Bring the village belle here.

1527
02:03:02,105 --> 02:03:07,435
If I don't rob her
of her marital status...

1528
02:03:07,515 --> 02:03:10,909
I will never boast again!

1529
02:03:17,078 --> 02:03:18,811
Either of us lives now!

1530
02:03:28,594 --> 02:03:30,749
Are you asleep or awake?

1531
02:03:31,891 --> 02:03:34,257
I don't know whether
I'm asleep or awake!

1532
02:03:34,337 --> 02:03:36,613
Whether I'm alive or dead!

1533
02:03:39,497 --> 02:03:45,321
I understand it, Amit.
I understand it all.

1534
02:03:47,029 --> 02:03:49,102
Your father will never
accept me.

1535
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:51,404
Isn't that what you're
trying to say?

1536
02:03:51,428 --> 02:03:53,521
Give me one last chance, Malti!

1537
02:03:53,601 --> 02:03:56,530
I'll somehow try and
bring my father around!

1538
02:03:56,899 --> 02:03:59,645
But you love me, don't you?

1539
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,456
Yes, I do. I love you more
than I love my life.

1540
02:04:04,826 --> 02:04:08,530
Will you still love me, even
if I'm not in a position...

1541
02:04:08,856 --> 02:04:10,457
to pay your parents?

1542
02:04:14,898 --> 02:04:18,690
- You don't need to ask.
- That's it then!

1543
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:22,257
Let's have a registered
marriage in court!

1544
02:04:22,337 --> 02:04:24,515
My Mom will stand witness.

1545
02:04:24,691 --> 02:04:27,992
I'll give your parents
a written undertaking...

1546
02:04:28,072 --> 02:04:30,633
that they can have half
my salary...

1547
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:33,031
till such time as their
demand of dowry is met!

1548
02:04:33,269 --> 02:04:35,874
- Isn't that okay?
- Okay.

1549
02:04:36,365 --> 02:04:38,188
No power on earth
can stop us now!

1550
02:04:38,268 --> 02:04:40,500
Not your parents...
Not my cruel father!

1551
02:04:40,799 --> 02:04:43,679
Let's meet at the Registrar's office
at 4 p.m. the day after, then. Okay?

1552
02:04:44,081 --> 02:04:45,592
You will come there, won't you?

1553
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:52,060
But remember.

1554
02:04:52,412 --> 02:04:55,395
This will be the last
scene of our love-story.

1555
02:05:01,413 --> 02:05:02,724
Listen...

1556
02:05:03,084 --> 02:05:04,382
We are doomed!

1557
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:07,340
What are you doing here?

1558
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:10,241
Can't you see me
reading the newspapers?

1559
02:05:10,463 --> 02:05:12,604
You can read the news
tomorrow...

1560
02:05:13,108 --> 02:05:16,004
when our son figures
in the headlines!

1561
02:05:16,335 --> 02:05:19,202
Why? Is he being given
a national award?

1562
02:05:19,666 --> 02:05:23,234
- He's my son, after all!
- Your son? Big deal!

1563
02:05:23,314 --> 02:05:26,252
Let's hurry up... Amit is
about to play courtesan.

1564
02:05:26,468 --> 02:05:32,820
What?! Courtesan?
Has he had a sex-change?

1565
02:05:33,159 --> 02:05:36,562
He's going to commit suicide
the way the courtesan did!

1566
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:39,285
He's burying himself alive!

1567
02:05:39,891 --> 02:05:41,273
He dares!

1568
02:06:05,126 --> 02:06:07,681
What are you up to, my son?

1569
02:06:08,049 --> 02:06:10,907
I'm sacrificing myself
in the name of love!

1570
02:06:11,348 --> 02:06:14,884
You are about to undertake
a great deed, my son!

1571
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:17,084
It will immortalise
our family name!

1572
02:06:17,621 --> 02:06:22,311
But to bury yourself in sand
and cement is a cheap way.

1573
02:06:22,391 --> 02:06:24,053
You should have thought
of a better way.

1574
02:06:24,133 --> 02:06:27,493
No! This is how I will die!

1575
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:30,205
Those last bricks...

1576
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:32,294
will cement my death,
the moment I signal it!

1577
02:06:32,568 --> 02:06:35,880
The path of my life
will be shut forever!

1578
02:06:36,748 --> 02:06:40,651
My darling son!
Deign to tell me...

1579
02:06:40,731 --> 02:06:45,117
- whom are you dying for?
- For Malti!

1580
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:51,632
Scoundrel! I must place
the last brick then!

1581
02:06:51,712 --> 02:06:55,027
- You will be hanged for that!
- I'll bribe my way out!

1582
02:06:55,316 --> 02:06:57,857
Listen!
Don't kill our son!

1583
02:06:57,937 --> 02:07:02,586
I've had every experience in life
except that of murder.

1584
02:07:03,156 --> 02:07:04,979
Let me satisfy myself today.

1585
02:07:07,985 --> 02:07:10,787
Let's prepare to leave
for the crematorium!

1586
02:07:17,592 --> 02:07:19,077
What a bloody father!

1587
02:07:26,186 --> 02:07:30,388
That's 200 grams of gold, okay?

1588
02:07:30,468 --> 02:07:32,549
Okay, aunty.
I get it!

1589
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:34,597
Go on! He's coming
this way!

1590
02:07:35,738 --> 02:07:38,284
He'll end his life,
he says! Big deal!

1591
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:42,689
But I'm no mean father...
I'm a dictator myself!

1592
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:46,781
What's this?
Gold?

1593
02:07:47,133 --> 02:07:51,600
Come and take a look!
We have stolen gold in our house!

1594
02:07:55,658 --> 02:07:59,522
That's not stolen gold, Mister!

1595
02:08:00,282 --> 02:08:02,199
It's my hard-earned savings!

1596
02:08:02,506 --> 02:08:04,765
What nonsense are you talking?

1597
02:08:05,525 --> 02:08:09,964
It's not nonsense...
I'm telling you something!

1598
02:08:12,803 --> 02:08:13,894
Okay. Go on.

1599
02:08:13,974 --> 02:08:18,012
Take a good look, Mr Chaudhary!

1600
02:08:18,258 --> 02:08:22,843
Or show it to a jeweller!
The gold is for real!

1601
02:08:23,766 --> 02:08:26,261
I know that. I'm not blind.
But what is it for?

1602
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:33,746
You had once asked for
200 grams of gold...

1603
02:08:33,826 --> 02:08:36,392
to accept my sister as
your daughter-in-law.

1604
02:08:36,574 --> 02:08:38,104
There is the 200 grams!

1605
02:08:38,184 --> 02:08:41,510
I've kept my promise.
You must honour your word now.

1606
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:44,911
Or I'll assume that you are
a two-tongued fraud!

1607
02:08:50,942 --> 02:08:54,122
I wish you had landed
this slap on me...

1608
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:56,288
when I joked about the gold.

1609
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:01,765
You have slapped me repeatedly
by showing me this gold today!

1610
02:09:03,136 --> 02:09:04,924
I had only joked with you!

1611
02:09:06,188 --> 02:09:09,788
And my son Amit,
who hates village folks...

1612
02:09:10,384 --> 02:09:12,284
cashed in on my jokes.

1613
02:09:13,226 --> 02:09:15,924
I want nothing of this!
I already have it all!

1614
02:09:16,586 --> 02:09:17,655
Come with me...

1615
02:09:24,838 --> 02:09:29,878
Take a look at the
jewellery and money!

1616
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,509
I'm perhaps the only man in
these times of robberies...

1617
02:09:35,589 --> 02:09:37,832
who keeps no less than
half a million in cash!

1618
02:09:38,711 --> 02:09:41,514
Who does it all belong to?
To my son, of course.

1619
02:09:41,914 --> 02:09:43,814
And to my daughter-in-law.

1620
02:09:49,902 --> 02:09:54,000
My real treasure and the
wealth of this family...

1621
02:09:55,576 --> 02:10:01,645
is peace and love and
my daughter-in-law.

1622
02:10:02,641 --> 02:10:04,252
I want nothing but
my daughter-in-law!

1623
02:10:04,332 --> 02:10:06,562
Listen! We are doomed!

1624
02:10:06,795 --> 02:10:10,340
There's terrible news
from Madhuri!

1625
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:14,677
- May I read it?
- Why must you ask! Go on!

1626
02:10:14,757 --> 02:10:17,486
My greetings to those who
consider women an object...

1627
02:10:17,566 --> 02:10:20,017
of pleasure and
a mere commodity.

1628
02:10:22,077 --> 02:10:24,034
I'm sending you
200 grams of gold...

1629
02:10:24,114 --> 02:10:26,823
which I want you all to lick
to your heart's satisfaction!

1630
02:10:28,314 --> 02:10:31,889
I'm a modern woman, who is
standing on her own two feet.

1631
02:10:32,167 --> 02:10:33,934
I am taking my own decisions.

1632
02:10:34,014 --> 02:10:38,414
And I have decided
to dispatch to hell...

1633
02:10:38,652 --> 02:10:41,523
my useless husband and
my greedy father-in-law!

1634
02:10:41,774 --> 02:10:44,484
I'm getting married again,
without a divorce.

1635
02:10:44,564 --> 02:10:46,217
The fortunate Madhuri!

1636
02:10:46,419 --> 02:10:51,138
No! This cannot be!
I won't let that happen!

1637
02:10:51,486 --> 02:10:54,011
You mustn't let that
happen, Shreekant!

1638
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:57,574
It would kill me!
I wouldn't live anymore!

1639
02:10:57,785 --> 02:11:01,128
I beg of you, Shreekant!
I beg at your feet!

1640
02:11:01,858 --> 02:11:05,666
You are making a sinner
out of me, sir!

1641
02:11:06,133 --> 02:11:09,844
It is I who has sinned. To play
such jokes is also a sin.

1642
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:11,764
I am the sinner.

1643
02:11:12,484 --> 02:11:17,102
But ask your sister not
to punish me like this.

1644
02:11:18,395 --> 02:11:21,368
Only you can help me now.

1645
02:11:22,635 --> 02:11:25,036
I swear by God...

1646
02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:27,809
I'll never play
such a joke again!

1647
02:11:28,759 --> 02:11:32,753
Please forgive me, sir!
I've hurt your feelings!

1648
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:34,974
I can't bear to see
your plight anymore!

1649
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:39,019
You will light the
Diwali lamps tomorrow...

1650
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:41,780
only after my sister
arrives in this house!

1651
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:45,168
That is a solemn promise
I make to you!

1652
02:11:47,789 --> 02:11:49,170
Let's embrace!

1653
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:50,123
Malti will surely arrive.
Don't worry.

1654
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:52,564
She must be getting ready
or even feeling shy.

1655
02:12:53,239 --> 02:12:55,824
Although this is a
registered marriage...

1656
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:59,160
she can't forget our customs.

1657
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:01,539
I hope we don't miss the
date in the process!

1658
02:13:01,619 --> 02:13:03,432
That's what I'm really
worried about.

1659
02:13:04,335 --> 02:13:06,248
I have a feeling that she
will surely turn up.

1660
02:13:06,962 --> 02:13:08,864
Maybe she's gone to
buy a garland.

1661
02:13:08,944 --> 02:13:11,481
I told her that I hate
this hackneyed customs.

1662
02:13:11,561 --> 02:13:13,041
If I had to adhere to
these customs...

1663
02:13:13,111 --> 02:13:15,128
why'd I get married again
in this manner?

1664
02:13:15,584 --> 02:13:19,553
No one knows that you
are already married!

1665
02:13:20,136 --> 02:13:21,783
Speak softly, Mom!
What are you doing?!

1666
02:13:36,402 --> 02:13:39,340
My left-eye is fluttering, Mom!

1667
02:13:39,726 --> 02:13:41,901
I suspect we have a
calamity on hand!

1668
02:13:42,155 --> 02:13:45,136
You shouldn't utter such
inauspicious words, my son.

1669
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,919
There she is!

1670
02:14:15,673 --> 02:14:19,281
What's that, Malti? You have
matrimonial vermillion in your hair?!

1671
02:14:19,545 --> 02:14:21,265
It's I who must apply
the vermillion on you!

1672
02:14:21,657 --> 02:14:24,707
I see! This is Malti then!

1673
02:14:25,798 --> 02:14:29,788
Is it your custom to apply
vermillion before marriage?

1674
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:32,731
What's all that about?

1675
02:14:33,081 --> 02:14:37,003
It's vermillion. The marital
status of a woman!

1676
02:14:37,870 --> 02:14:41,435
Stop joking, Malti!

1677
02:14:41,931 --> 02:14:43,787
You're going to give me
a heart-attack!

1678
02:14:43,867 --> 02:14:45,715
You should have had
a heart-attack...

1679
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:48,620
the day you walked out on
an innocent village girl...

1680
02:14:48,992 --> 02:14:52,058
trembling and crying, even
after you had married her!

1681
02:14:52,511 --> 02:14:56,259
Had you a heart, you'd have
suffered an attack the day...

1682
02:14:56,669 --> 02:14:58,768
you feigned love for me...

1683
02:14:59,139 --> 02:15:01,101
without telling me that
you're a married man!

1684
02:15:01,181 --> 02:15:07,304
She knows everything, Amit!
What happens now?

1685
02:15:07,617 --> 02:15:09,285
Keep quiet, mother.

1686
02:15:11,915 --> 02:15:14,047
How can you do this, Mother?

1687
02:15:14,548 --> 02:15:16,462
Even as your first daughter-
in-law still lives...

1688
02:15:16,486 --> 02:15:19,127
how can you stand witness in
your son's second marriage?

1689
02:15:20,327 --> 02:15:21,638
I couldn't help it!

1690
02:15:22,337 --> 02:15:24,900
My love for my son
has blinded me!

1691
02:15:28,616 --> 02:15:31,836
You have put on act with me;
and so did I with you.

1692
02:15:32,568 --> 02:15:35,430
You are a married man;
and I'm a married woman.

1693
02:15:36,012 --> 02:15:37,612
When you had the right
to fall in love...

1694
02:15:37,668 --> 02:15:41,308
inspite of being married,
I have the same right, too!

1695
02:15:42,125 --> 02:15:45,153
- She's right, Amit.
- Quiet!

1696
02:15:47,209 --> 02:15:51,473
Despite all this, I still
have a lot of respect for you.

1697
02:15:51,978 --> 02:15:54,966
Bless me then that my
return to my husband...

1698
02:15:55,224 --> 02:15:57,377
be auspicious and God-blessed.

1699
02:15:58,796 --> 02:16:01,068
May you be happy.

1700
02:16:07,808 --> 02:16:10,588
There's only one
way out now, son.

1701
02:16:11,285 --> 02:16:14,253
Let's bring Madhuri home
on this day of Diwali.

1702
02:16:14,985 --> 02:16:17,311
The second wife has
fled with her husband.

1703
02:16:17,910 --> 02:16:20,074
We only have the first
daughter-in-law now.

1704
02:16:20,445 --> 02:16:23,098
There's a great awakening
among women these days.

1705
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:25,733
I hope the your first wife...

1706
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:28,043
doesn't marry someone else, too!

1707
02:16:41,039 --> 02:16:43,654
- Why are you laughing?
- I was reminded of something!

1708
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:48,443
Isn't this how you paced up
and down when Amit was born?

1709
02:16:49,058 --> 02:16:52,748
What else could I do?
I was expecting my son then.

1710
02:16:53,625 --> 02:16:56,662
And I'm expecting
my daughter-in-law now.

1711
02:16:57,054 --> 02:16:59,218
- Why hasn't she arrived?
- You have changed for good.

1712
02:16:59,529 --> 02:17:01,500
But your son is still as
fickle-minded as ever.

1713
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:04,963
What if he refuses
to accept Malti...

1714
02:17:05,043 --> 02:17:07,086
I'm not a fool either!

1715
02:17:07,243 --> 02:17:09,269
Look at these documents!

1716
02:17:09,623 --> 02:17:12,167
I have bequeathed all my
property and wealth...

1717
02:17:12,246 --> 02:17:14,470
to the daughter-in-law!

1718
02:17:14,697 --> 02:17:17,161
Let me see how he
refuses to accept her!

1719
02:17:23,352 --> 02:17:24,729
Daughter-in-law!

1720
02:17:25,459 --> 02:17:26,894
Come along...

1721
02:17:46,002 --> 02:17:49,271
We have the Goddess here
in person this auspicious day.

1722
02:17:50,324 --> 02:17:53,476
Do come in, daughter-in-law
and bless this house.

1723
02:17:55,648 --> 02:17:57,196
Come in, dear.

1724
02:18:02,687 --> 02:18:06,116
No! I have already sinned!
Do not commit me to anymore sins!

1725
02:18:07,491 --> 02:18:09,952
We have all made some
mistake or the other.

1726
02:18:10,626 --> 02:18:12,761
But God has forgiven us
and made you return to us.

1727
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:18,083
- Take care of your home now.
- Isn't her husband at home?

1728
02:18:18,489 --> 02:18:19,790
Don't even utter his name!

1729
02:18:21,418 --> 02:18:23,504
I don't want to hide
anything from you, dear.

1730
02:18:24,018 --> 02:18:25,755
Amit has really heaped
humiliation on me.

1731
02:18:26,221 --> 02:18:28,432
He has ruined the
family's reputation.

1732
02:18:29,596 --> 02:18:30,918
But don't you worry!

1733
02:18:31,447 --> 02:18:33,307
If he still does not
come to his senses...

1734
02:18:33,387 --> 02:18:34,733
I will throw him
out of the house.

1735
02:18:34,832 --> 02:18:37,087
Look; I have bequeathed
everything to you.

1736
02:18:37,386 --> 02:18:39,172
All my wealth and estate!

1737
02:18:39,252 --> 02:18:43,271
Please don't say that...
that can never happen!

1738
02:18:43,869 --> 02:18:48,668
Because I'm Madhuri
and Malti, too!

1739
02:18:48,748 --> 02:18:50,785
- What?!
- That's right!

1740
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:53,009
What she says is true.

1741
02:18:53,663 --> 02:18:56,039
When our son rejected her...

1742
02:18:56,416 --> 02:18:59,398
she had to strive and stand
on her own two feet.

1743
02:19:00,129 --> 02:19:02,305
She found a job
in Amit's office...

1744
02:19:02,847 --> 02:19:05,029
and enticed him as Malti.

1745
02:19:07,307 --> 02:19:11,891
I had to turn Malti in order
to win back my husband.

1746
02:19:12,242 --> 02:19:19,392
Fantastic! You are the
epitome of all virtue!

1747
02:19:20,592 --> 02:19:23,274
Does the ass know the truth yet?

1748
02:19:23,353 --> 02:19:26,699
- Who's that?
- The ass! Amit!

1749
02:19:27,251 --> 02:19:28,325
No. He doesn't.

1750
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:31,017
Fantastic! This is
going to be fun!

1751
02:19:31,377 --> 02:19:33,696
I have now started believing
in your God, too!

1752
02:19:34,483 --> 02:19:37,489
He will come back, all right.
Where would he go anyway?

1753
02:19:38,116 --> 02:19:40,115
Take daughter-in-law
upstairs, Saraswati.

1754
02:19:41,415 --> 02:19:43,989
I'll deal with the ass!

1755
02:19:50,584 --> 02:19:55,237
All my dreams are
fulfilled today, Shreekant.

1756
02:19:55,317 --> 02:19:57,315
Of course. You had to
realise your dreams.

1757
02:19:57,542 --> 02:19:58,977
As for Amit...

1758
02:19:59,741 --> 02:20:03,342
let him return. And see
how I deal with him!

1759
02:20:29,066 --> 02:20:31,726
When have I turned Pop from Dad?

1760
02:20:32,449 --> 02:20:36,685
Since I've turned what I am.

1761
02:20:37,111 --> 02:20:40,109
- Are you drunk?
- What else could I do?

1762
02:20:40,515 --> 02:20:43,580
My father has been drinking
to my grief, all my life.

1763
02:20:43,947 --> 02:20:46,532
To drown my sorrows then,
I had some liquor today.

1764
02:20:46,858 --> 02:20:51,203
I haven't had much...
it's only 10 or 12 drinks.

1765
02:20:51,845 --> 02:20:52,976
Listen, son...

1766
02:20:55,373 --> 02:20:59,116
There's no son and father
anymore. It's all over!

1767
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:03,217
Throw that cursed bottle away.
And look who's here.

1768
02:21:03,582 --> 02:21:05,952
- Your brother-in-law, Shreekant.
- Greetings, brother-in-law!

1769
02:21:05,976 --> 02:21:07,995
Damn the brother-in-law!

1770
02:21:08,641 --> 02:21:13,524
I'll tell you today what you'd
have, if not the Himalayas!

1771
02:21:13,734 --> 02:21:16,242
You'd have a great wall
in my father instead!

1772
02:21:16,462 --> 02:21:19,816
Who'd destroy the world with
his misplaced ideals!

1773
02:21:19,896 --> 02:21:22,423
And they'd be forced to
like bitter-gourd!

1774
02:21:22,503 --> 02:21:25,306
What are you saying, Amit?!

1775
02:21:26,068 --> 02:21:27,862
We wanted to give you
a piece of good news.

1776
02:21:27,942 --> 02:21:31,312
- What good news?
- You'll get a slap...

1777
02:21:33,073 --> 02:21:35,455
You are our only son.

1778
02:21:35,895 --> 02:21:37,874
In your happiness lies
our own happiness, too.

1779
02:21:38,314 --> 02:21:41,051
We will forget your wife
Madhuri, as you have.

1780
02:21:41,131 --> 02:21:44,622
We will also get you
married to your lover, Malti.

1781
02:21:44,702 --> 02:21:47,500
Yes! Let's forget everything
else, except Malti!

1782
02:21:52,460 --> 02:21:55,651
She feigned love for me!

1783
02:21:56,428 --> 02:21:59,600
She has cheated me!

1784
02:22:00,035 --> 02:22:02,299
I wouldn't want to set my
eyes on her ever again!

1785
02:22:02,753 --> 02:22:06,116
She has betrayed me!

1786
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:09,303
We want to forget just
what you are trying to.

1787
02:22:09,466 --> 02:22:14,386
We can even bring Madhuri
home, should you be willing.

1788
02:22:15,476 --> 02:22:22,256
What joke is this between
Madhuri and Malti?!

1789
02:22:23,333 --> 02:22:25,090
I want neither!

1790
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:27,713
Neither the village-belle
nor the city-bred!

1791
02:22:27,793 --> 02:22:30,189
I will remain a bachelor
all my life.

1792
02:22:30,269 --> 02:22:35,113
And I will show everyone
how you have ruined my life!

1793
02:22:35,193 --> 02:22:38,225
You have! A wicked
father has!

1794
02:22:38,305 --> 02:22:43,985
Who has killed and mauled
his only son!

1795
02:22:44,236 --> 02:22:45,521
Don't worry!

1796
02:22:45,899 --> 02:22:48,576
Everything will be fine,
the moment he goes upstairs.

1797
02:23:00,491 --> 02:23:03,122
You?! What the hell
are you doing here?

1798
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:11,987
Forgive me.
I had no other choice.

1799
02:23:14,769 --> 02:23:17,354
You scheming bitch!

1800
02:23:17,577 --> 02:23:19,570
You first pretended to
fall in love with me!

1801
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:22,131
And you've gotten into my house now!
Get the hell out of here!

1802
02:23:22,363 --> 02:23:25,126
Get out, I say!

1803
02:23:25,206 --> 02:23:28,566
I will end the
drama you've begun!

1804
02:23:30,827 --> 02:23:32,329
Get out!

1805
02:23:33,088 --> 02:23:35,243
Not a word from you!

1806
02:23:36,739 --> 02:23:38,137
- Listen to me...
- Come on!

1807
02:23:49,109 --> 02:23:50,338
Let's go!

1808
02:23:59,595 --> 02:24:02,614
- What's that?
- The marriage altar.

1809
02:24:03,889 --> 02:24:06,689
- What do you mean?
- I'll explain.

1810
02:24:07,575 --> 02:24:10,461
Ladies and gentlemen...

1811
02:24:10,816 --> 02:24:12,043
Hold it, you idiot!

1812
02:24:12,247 --> 02:24:16,271
How dare you address them
without our presence?

1813
02:24:17,418 --> 02:24:19,096
Get on with your speech!

1814
02:24:20,147 --> 02:24:22,014
Ladies and gentlemen...

1815
02:24:22,734 --> 02:24:25,983
you mustn't have heard or
seen a marriage of this kind.

1816
02:24:26,764 --> 02:24:30,722
A man is marrying his wife
for the second time today.

1817
02:24:31,188 --> 02:24:32,279
What does that mean?

1818
02:24:32,359 --> 02:24:36,598
Just as I had humiliated
my wife in public...

1819
02:24:36,678 --> 02:24:39,054
at the wedding-altar one day...

1820
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:46,731
I now apologise to my wife
in your presence with folded hands.

1821
02:24:46,811 --> 02:24:49,005
What's that you're doing?

1822
02:24:49,223 --> 02:24:51,295
I married Madhuri
during the days...

1823
02:24:52,593 --> 02:24:54,528
when I was blinded by the
glasses of stupidity.

1824
02:24:54,854 --> 02:24:58,223
My father cast a shadow
in one of the lens!

1825
02:24:59,727 --> 02:25:02,396
It did take time.
But I realised the truth.

1826
02:25:03,405 --> 02:25:06,264
I was the only filth
around my rose-like wife.

1827
02:25:06,590 --> 02:25:09,854
- And also...
- Your father!

1828
02:25:10,039 --> 02:25:11,804
Before this sacred fire...

1829
02:25:12,934 --> 02:25:14,882
around which we have
taken the vows...

1830
02:25:15,759 --> 02:25:20,545
I choose Madhuri as my
companion till eternity!

1831
02:25:21,962 --> 02:25:25,814
Please forgive me, Madhuri.

1832
02:25:26,175 --> 02:25:29,896
Don't say that!
But how did you...

1833
02:25:30,608 --> 02:25:33,758
Don't be angry, my dear.

1834
02:25:33,934 --> 02:25:36,081
I couldn't see him upset.

1835
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:39,205
And so I told him
the whole truth.

1836
02:25:39,742 --> 02:25:41,317
Forgive him, dear.

1837
02:25:41,625 --> 02:25:47,123
I knew the bitter-gourd would
drill some sense into him!

1838
02:25:47,959 --> 02:25:51,602
I'll answer you today, Shreekant.
Had it not been for the Himalayas...

1839
02:25:51,839 --> 02:25:52,904
What would we have then?

1840
02:25:53,395 --> 02:25:55,401
We'd have the daughter-in-law!
