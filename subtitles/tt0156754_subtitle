1
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,158
Lord, if you gave me a child...

2
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,569
you should have given me the
strength to bring him up.

3
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,098
I lost my husband and everything.

4
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,500
I have no support now.

5
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:08,106
Where can I wander with this
innocent child?

6
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:12,517
Now you are all he has.

7
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:23,101
"Kanhaiya, you have to come!"

8
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:30,105
"And fulfill Your promise!"

9
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:11,080
"Be in Gokul or in Mathura"

10
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:25,495
"But please show me
Your benevolent face"

11
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,503
"o dusky Lord..."

12
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:47,517
"just come and see how bereft
your Dwarka is"

13
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,426
"The waters of Lamuna have
also stood still"

14
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,093
"Everything has stood still"

15
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,103
"It is the same lanes
of Kunj..."

16
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,110
"and the same gopis..."

17
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:52,523
"but nothing is the same
without You"

18
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:30,429
"There is no cowherd
for Your cows"

19
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:45,510
"Your possession is
not taken care of'

20
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:54,112
"Many..."

21
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,054
"Kansa like people have surfaced..."

22
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:07,624
"and no home is free from evil"

23
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,086
Glories to Lord Krishna!

24
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,471
Raju, people give you money
out of pity.

25
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,475
And you offer that money to God.

26
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:34,475
Baba, of use is this
money to me?

27
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,080
All I crave is a glimpse of
the Lord.

28
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,084
He is my parents and everything
else to me.

29
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,086
He gives me a place to sleep on
his steps and fruits to eat.

30
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,089
So of what use are these
silver coins to me?

31
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,491
Are you repaying God for
feeding you...

32
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:53,095
and taking care of you?

33
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,498
Baba, I don't make these
offerings to please god.

34
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,101
Take the lord's offerings.

35
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,519
Lord, did you eat?

36
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,114
Can I also eat now?

37
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,128
Raju, now go to sleep.

38
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,551
Welcome, sir!

39
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:45,147
- Raju, how are you? - I am fine
living in Shyam's shadow.

40
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,493
Mr Pandey, today I am going to
sow the seeds for a new harvest.

41
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,223
So, pray with complete devotion.

42
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:54,555
As you please.

43
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:58,160
Ramu, ring the bell so hard...

44
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,096
that its sound can be heard
for miles.

45
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,533
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome, sir!

46
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,130
Mr Pandey, wait!

47
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,130
Come here!

48
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,538
There was a diamond in the
peacock crown. Where is it?

49
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,142
Sir, I too saw it at night.

50
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,145
Then where did it disappear
at the break of dawn?

51
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:52,556
Who would dare to steal
from the temple?

52
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,491
- Who all were here at night?
- Only Raju.

53
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,555
Sir, only Raju could have
done this.

54
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:05,494
Raju, did you steal the diamond
from the Lord's peacock crown?

55
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,100
Is one of the diamonds of my
lord missing?

56
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,101
Don't try to act innocent.

57
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:15,107
I have always only concentrated
on the lord's face.

58
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,516
It is today that I got to know that
the lord is adorned with diamonds.

59
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,111
- It was. - Raju, if you have
made a mistake, accept it.

60
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,115
Or sir will whip your skin.

61
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,517
If this is a what my lord wants...

62
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,518
then so be it.

63
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,121
Raju, don't provoke me.

64
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:38,126
You have grown up on this
temple's offerings.

65
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:41,132
Tell me where is the diamond.

66
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:45,133
I swear by my lord,
I am innocent.

67
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,139
- Then who stole this diamond?
- How would I know?

68
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:52,549
- Oh! - Sir, don't hit an
innocent devotee.

69
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,551
So, should I embrace him?

70
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:56,553
He has insulted the lord.

71
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,556
Sir, I don't agree with it.

72
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,086
I have been serving in this
temple since the last 25 years.

73
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:06,497
And I have always got this
feeling...

74
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,095
as if the lord resides in this
temple only for Raju.

75
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:16,101
So then where did that
diamond disappear?

76
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,101
I am a trustee of this temple.

77
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,104
And it is I who has to
answer everybody.

78
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:25,107
Answer me.

79
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,116
Sir, I beg you to stop this.

80
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,117
Raju is a child of this
temple.

81
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,121
- He is part of the lord.
- All this is rubbish.

82
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:44,127
Get the diamond from him by morning
or ask him to leave the village.

83
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,129
There is no place for
thieves in this temple.

84
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,546
Don't cry, my child!

85
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:06,083
Am I a thief? Didn't you
see that I am accused of theft?

86
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:10,485
What a friend are you?

87
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:15,499
I was being thrashed but you
kept playing your flute?

88
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:18,502
You know that I am not a thief.

89
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,097
Then why didn't you tell the
world?

90
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:26,109
I know you also want me to
leave your house and go.

91
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,513
If you want to throw me out of
the temple, ask me to do so.

92
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,447
Who is the world to throw
me out?

93
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:36,511
Keep aside your flute and tell
everyone that I am innocent.

94
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:42,527
Why are you silent? I never
considered you an idol.

95
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:44,518
To me you have always been god.

96
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,522
All I know is how to pray.

97
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:51,126
Where can I go now?
Tell me.

98
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,527
Alright, don't talk.

99
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,074
- Raju, you...
- I will go.

100
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,077
He wants me to leave.

101
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,081
It is you who has broken this
relationship with me.

102
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:18,086
I am going.
Now, pray alone to the lord.

103
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,499
You will get enough money
but not Raju.

104
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:26,094
Raju, there must be some good
in your going away.

105
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:28,095
You go to Mathura.

106
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:32,502
Doesn't he reside in Mathura also?

107
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,512
- I will not go to Mathura.
- Then go to Bombay.

108
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:39,107
My nephew stays there.
Here is his address.

109
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,512
He will help you.

110
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:47,515
My child, keep this money
for the journey.

111
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:52,122
Baba, will this money be
enough all my life?

112
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:56,126
Don't lose hope. Your lord is
just playing pranks with you.

113
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,127
Lust as he'd once done
with Sudama.

114
00:15:58,537 --> 00:16:01,404
Then see how he uplifted
Sudama?

115
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,410
There was no Sudama or Krishna.

116
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,470
It must be a figment of
some writer's mind.

117
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,464
Thief, return my belongings.
There is an address in it.

118
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,458
See and walk.

119
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:07,062
That thief stole my belongings.

120
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,065
- Are you new to the city?
- Yes.

121
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:12,069
- I've been recently exiled.
- You seem to be troubled.

122
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,482
The lord Himself cast me away
and betrayed my trust.

123
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:25,480
Now the great seer Ganesh Duttji
will give a discourse.

124
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,489
Lord Shri Krishna has said
in the 'Gita'...

125
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:52,517
It means those who serve the
lord and chant his name...

126
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,112
with devotion and complete
faith...

127
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:02,458
then the lord says He is
responsible...

128
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,461
for all their belongings in
this material world.

129
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,455
Sing unanimously...

130
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:11,059
glories to Lord Krishna!

131
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:18,476
Glories to Lord Krishna!

132
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,080
All this is lies.
There is no Krishna, no god.

133
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,482
Who is he who is maligning
the lord?

134
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:37,494
Hit him!

135
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
Calm down!
Everyone go to your seats.

136
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,096
Child, you come to me.

137
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:53,101
Seer, he is an atheist. Then why
are you calling him to you?

138
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,104
Nobody is an atheist in this
world.

139
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,105
Only uninitiated.

140
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:02,044
And to enlighten people like
him, the lord in every era...

141
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:07,048
has been incarnated in several
human forms.

142
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,393
Like Lesus Christ, Prophet
Mohammed, Shri Krishna...

143
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,463
Shankaracharya, etc.

144
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,459
And these incarnations had
to undergo many trials...

145
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,061
to succeed in their mission.

146
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:24,065
So much so that they had
to even sacrifice their lives.

147
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:26,476
This child also has doubts.

148
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,072
And it is my duty to clear them.

149
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,075
Child, I'll explain to you if
god exists or no.

150
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,077
God doesn't exists.

151
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:42,091
If I ask you a few questions,
won't you answer me?

152
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:44,084
Don't ask me anything about god.

153
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:48,092
About the seasons?
How many types of seasons exist?

154
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,432
- Four.
- What are they?

155
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,094
Summer, winter, spring and
autumn.

156
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,497
Summer, winter, spring and
autumn.

157
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,099
- What are their forms?
- Forms?

158
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,103
In what form have you seen them?

159
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,512
Seasons have no form.

160
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,505
But you do experience them?

161
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,108
Yes, I feel hot during summer
and cold during winter.

162
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,524
It means despite not seeing a
thing you can experience it?

163
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:19,120
Similarly God is a power that you
can't see...

164
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,121
you only experience it.

165
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,129
Seer, I experienced enough
but what did I get?

166
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,128
You experienced but didn't
get anything.

167
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,476
It means you were not always
an atheist.

168
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,135
But are angry with god
over something.

169
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,548
- What else can I do? - In which
form do you worship Him?

170
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:42,143
I was a devotee of Shyam. Since
childhood, I've been serving him.

171
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:46,549
I swept the temple floor and ate
only the temple offerings.

172
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,559
His name was always on my lips.

173
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,157
I considered him to be my friend,
my master.

174
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,557
But he forsook me.

175
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,160
- You fail to understand.
- I'll explain.

176
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,506
I was accused of theft in
that temple.

177
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:04,098
That I stole the diamond from
the lord's crown.

178
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:09,512
Your heart also melted on
hearing my tale.

179
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:13,107
But the lord didn't melt and
refused to help me.

180
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,513
He didn't help you because the
lord wanted to test you.

181
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:24,118
Lust as children give exams in
school to go to higher classes...

182
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,523
so too in this world also god
tests every human-being.

183
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:32,527
Child, this world is the
highest level of school.

184
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:34,537
And it's tests are equally
difficult.

185
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,532
Only those who pass this test...

186
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:40,543
can become one with the lord.

187
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,138
Gold ornaments are made only when
gold is melted in the fire.

188
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,145
Soiled clothes are heated only
then do they shine.

189
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:52,555
You can get close to Him only
after these trials.

190
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:55,558
And only then can you understand
his ways.

191
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,151
He has not forsaken you.

192
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:01,089
He doesn't forsake any
living being.

193
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,496
He protects everyone from an insect
and a worm to a child in the womb.

194
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,104
Child, so don't have room for
any doubts in your mind.

195
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:18,108
And like a true devotee face
all the trials and move ahead.

196
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,109
If there is any sincerity in
my years of penance...

197
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,520
then I assure you...

198
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:25,522
that your Shyam will surely
help you.

199
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,526
And if He won't, I'll wipe off this
sandalwood paste from my forehead.

200
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,523
Pardon me. In my ignorance
I have made a grave mistake.

201
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,126
I have maligned god.

202
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,470
- Please pardon me.
- Get up, child.

203
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,136
Repentance is the atonement
for sin.

204
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,536
Never lose faith in the lord.

205
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:07,088
Narangi, what is the price
of apples?

206
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:10,093
- Rs twelve a dozen. - But the
market price is Rs 9 a dozen.

207
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,098
Those apples must be like you.

208
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,097
My apples are young.
I don't sell rotten goods.

209
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,508
Alright, give me half a dozen.

210
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,103
Give Baba six healthy young
apples.

211
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,510
Murti has shut his shop during
peak business hours.

212
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:34,515
I was a fool to buy these shops
on hire and lease them.

213
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:38,519
How will he pay my rent if
the shop remains closed?

214
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:54,544
Do you do smuggling that you
shut the shop and sit inside?

215
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,548
I didn't do any business by
keeping the shop open.

216
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:00,413
So I decided to shut the
shop and try.

217
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:04,081
Will you pay my last month's
rent or no?

218
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,425
I'll pay as soon as I make a sale.
Yours is the first shop.

219
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,492
Whoever comes you lighten
their pockets.

220
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,084
So who will come to my shop?

221
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,496
Murti, learn to do business.

222
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,491
You need advertisement to sell
your product.

223
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,094
Hoteliers sell their food by
having cabaret shows.

224
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,502
Shops sell garments by
advertising with girls.

225
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,512
Films are sold by advertising the
hero and heroine on either side...

226
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,104
with a tree in between.

227
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:35,109
Stop making pictures of gods
and goddesses.

228
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:39,116
People demand much more than
this.

229
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,526
People remember god at home also
so why will they buy pictures?

230
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,524
As long as their is suffering
people will buy pictures of gods.

231
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:53,130
I'll see how long your fruit
shop makes a profit.

232
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,531
Sex and fruits are seasonal.

233
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:58,541
The client's mood changes
after a while.

234
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:03,481
Murti, you always speak
harsh words with me.

235
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,080
Sir, what do you want?

236
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,081
- You do your business, I'll go.
- Where are you going?

237
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:16,085
Perhaps this customer also
stopped to see you.

238
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,087
Don't I have to take care of
my business?

239
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:19,486
You have readymade customers.

240
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:23,090
Even if you sell peanuts as
almonds, people will buy.

241
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:25,096
So why are you jealous?

242
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:32,102
Don't take all this seriously.
What do you want?

243
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,105
There are many forms of Krishna.

244
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:40,516
Rs three with frames and
Rs one without frames.

245
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:44,512
What are you thinking? God is
not expensive for Re one.

246
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:47,114
Yes, I'll come some other time.

247
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:49,118
You are my first customer
of the day.

248
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:51,117
I don't have so much money.

249
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,119
- How much money do you have?
- Fifty paise.

250
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:57,525
For that much money, I can give
you Lord Krishna's childhood photo.

251
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:02,473
I stayed hungry to save this
money for the lord's picture.

252
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,066
I haven't seen fifty paise
since two days.

253
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:09,070
- I hope you haven't lost it.
- No, I got my paper also.

254
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,075
- Please read it.
- First the fifty paise.

255
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:20,081
Mr Ram Murti, picture shop,
127, Menon Street.

256
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:27,490
127? You are making a fool
of me for fifty paise?

257
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,432
You are asking me for my address.
I am Ram Murti Pandey.

258
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:34,095
- Are you Mr Pandey's nephew?
- Yes, my uncle is a priest...

259
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,098
in a Krishna temple at
Basantpur.

260
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:37,497
And I am a pauper here.

261
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,510
- I have been looking for you.
- Are you from the police?

262
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:42,512
No. I am Raju and I've come
from Basantpur.

263
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,517
I was waiting for you.
Uncle wrote a letter.

264
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,519
- What did he write?
- I forgot that.

265
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,522
Let's go home, read the
letter and eat something.

266
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,516
You are hungry since two days.
Narangi, close the shop.

267
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,463
You chant the lord's name as
kids recite tables.

268
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,406
This chant washes away all sins.

269
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,477
You mean you have first to sin?

270
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,072
Sinners and sages both chant.

271
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,415
So it means sinners and sages
are brothers?

272
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,490
Sinners chant so that god
washes their sins.

273
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:31,087
And a good person chants so that
god saves him from sinning.

274
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:35,089
Look, Raju, you've come to the
city to look for a job...

275
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,489
or to give discourses?

276
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,502
I, a mere mortal,
what discourses can I give?

277
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,097
I can only pray...

278
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:47,501
to earn a decent living.

279
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,445
You can earn a decent living
with your hard-work.

280
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,107
I'll talk to Narangi and get
you a job.

281
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:22,072
Well done! You sold the entire
cartload on the first day itself.

282
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:26,482
You look like a fool but are
hardworking.

283
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,077
Here is Rs three,
your commission.

284
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,480
Look, Raju, this is your first
earning.

285
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,082
Give it to Murti.

286
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,494
How are you, brother Raju?

287
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,496
Here is my first earning.

288
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,502
- Have you given with a true heart?
- Yes.

289
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,094
And on Narangi's behest.

290
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,442
You have already started dancing
to your sister-in-law's tunes.

291
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:56,512
This is my first earning,
so just give me ten paise.

292
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:02,453
- For peanuts? - No, I'll
light incense sticks for my Shyam.

293
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,046
Coming, Narangi.

294
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,459
- Give my rent.
- I don't have money.

295
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,453
- What is this?
- It's itching.

296
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,056
- Itching, eh?
- This is Raju's money.

297
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:20,404
I got him a job on your
recommendation to retrieve my rent.

298
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:25,467
How business minded! You give from
one hand and take from the other.

299
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,070
Give me twenty paise. Raju wants
to light incense sticks to god.

300
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:31,471
Take this.

301
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:45,495
Rama, you are too much. I've been
waiting for you since so long.

302
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:50,093
- Where were you?
- Savitri, come home, let me relax.

303
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:53,097
- Did you have a race?
- Hear me out.

304
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:57,100
My sister suddenly came from her
in-law's house after many days.

305
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,513
We got talking and I forgot
about my appointment with you.

306
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:05,106
And as soon as I remembered
I took my cycle and came.

307
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:09,510
I drove fast and at the turn
almost collided with a bus.

308
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:13,116
I braked.
Had god not saved me...

309
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,117
I'd have been dead today.

310
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:19,121
You have to drag god in everything.

311
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:22,125
You used your brains and so
avoided the accident.

312
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,127
Where did god come between
your cycle and the bus?

313
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:28,529
You are swayed by the new
generation wave.

314
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,475
You want to use your philosophy
in everything.

315
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,535
Where is Renu and the rest of
the gang?

316
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:45,556
Ladies, I'm a traveler and have come
walking from a pilgrimage to Benaras.

317
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,152
I am starving.
Please feed me.

318
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,493
God will help you pass in
your exams.

319
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,565
Rama, don't give him anything.

320
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,559
He looks like a fraud.

321
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:03,098
Had he come walking from Benaras
he'd have blisters on his feet.

322
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:08,512
Sage, do you think by applying
vermilion and wearing a necklace...

323
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:10,503
anyone can become an ascetic?

324
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,517
If with your blessings,
your god can make us pass...

325
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,112
then can't he feed you?

326
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,458
Ladies, wait!

327
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,119
- My money? - What is the matter?
Why are you laughing?

328
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:29,532
- We were eating apples.
- But I am poor man.

329
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:33,536
- Give me money.
- Did these girls steal your fruits?

330
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:35,128
No, they snatched it.

331
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,136
- Why are you all laughing?
- Let them laugh.

332
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:41,534
But ask them to give my money.

333
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,547
These fruits are not mine.
I work for someone on daily wages.

334
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,550
I get one rupee if I sell
fruits worth ten rupees.

335
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:51,488
Why are you troubling a poor man?
Give him his money.

336
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:55,149
We have never paid for fruits.
Then why set a precedent today?

337
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:01,098
- How much do they owe you?
- Ten rupees.

338
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,492
- Here.
- May god bless you!

339
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:10,099
Again god! I wonder why people
harass god so much.

340
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,098
Let's go.

341
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:34,121
Lord, with your grace,
I am going to buy mango orchards.

342
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,122
Be with me.

343
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:39,128
All that I have is because
of your grace.

344
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:41,127
And it will be who will
always be giving me.

345
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,487
Lord, your devotee had come
to you.

346
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,120
You saved my life.

347
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:42,523
No.
Who am I to say your life?

348
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:47,130
This is the lord's miracle.

349
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:48,528
Take this.

350
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,136
Wait! What is your name?

351
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,077
- What do you do?
- I sell fruits to make a living.

352
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:07,481
- Are you alone?
- No, my lord is with me.

353
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:10,484
Despite being his devotee you
sell fruits.

354
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,097
Are you so poor?

355
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:16,431
I am not poor. My wealth is
a glimpse of my lord.

356
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,096
- Take this?
- What is this?

357
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:24,101
It is a small gift of Rs 10,000
from me.

358
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:29,106
What will I do with it?
Make a temple with this money.

359
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:31,448
My lord fulfills all my needs.

360
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:34,517
That's fine but you have
helped me.

361
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,521
Had you not come on time, this
epileptic fit would have killed me.

362
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:43,119
Or seeing me unconscious someone
would have stolen all my money.

363
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,121
Take it.
You make your life with this.

364
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,523
My lord will make my life.

365
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:55,129
Look, the lord came in your form
to save me.

366
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,533
So too probably god has come in my
form to relieve you of your poverty.

367
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,077
- Take it.
- No.

368
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,471
If you have any doubts then
ask your lord.

369
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,073
Come.

370
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:13,080
- Ask him. - Lord, one of your
devotees is tempting me.

371
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:14,480
What right do I have over
this wealth?

372
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:18,494
The lord has answered your
question.

373
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:22,089
The lord has given permission.
Take it.

374
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,098
This is a delicate situation.

375
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:36,107
What shall be done?
Look, the lord was fond of butter.

376
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:39,506
So let's start a shop of milk,
butter, curd and clarified butter.

377
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,110
I'll go and buy buffaloes
with this money.

378
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:45,512
We won't sell butter made from
buffalo milk.

379
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,116
Gopal was fond only of
mother cow.

380
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,461
We'll sell butter made from
cow's milk.

381
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,531
Raju, with money you have
acquired brains also.

382
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,534
Alright, we'll put a big
board tomorrow.

383
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:04,473
- Will I get clarified butter here?
- Sir, didn't you read the board?

384
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,067
This shop belongs to Raju,
a Krishna devotee.

385
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,071
There is no adulteration here.

386
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:13,077
We have our own cows and personally
supervise to their milking.

387
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,476
And we personally set the curd.

388
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,486
We personally supervise the
process of making butter...

389
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:19,078
and clarified butter.

390
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,480
And if the customer is known
to us...

391
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,423
we go to his house to see...

392
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:27,087
if he's mixing any adulterated
clarified milk to our pure one.

393
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,090
Alright, give me a tin of
four kilos.

394
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:34,496
Here and count Rs 60 and
give it to the boss.

395
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:39,099
Boss? No, He is everyone's boss.

396
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:44,504
Give me one kilo of
clarified butter.

397
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,112
- Pardon me, but...
- We don't sell one kilo.

398
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,457
But come with me and I'll get you
one kilo from our smaller shop.

399
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:58,117
Welcome!

400
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,465
Why are you so late?

401
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:21,415
"Glories to Nandlal!"

402
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,497
"Lord, you are my master".

403
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,480
- How are you?
- I'm sorry...

404
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,483
I couldn't send milk to your
diary for a few days.

405
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,078
Because some cows have fallen
sick.

406
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,479
And I want to buy a few more cows.

407
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:36,085
I am a poor man and couldn't
arrange for the money.

408
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:40,089
Don't worry; take as much money
as you want from the manager.

409
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:42,090
- Tell him I have said so.
- Thank you!

410
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,493
- Yes, auditor? - We've to pay Rs
1,50,000 income-tax to the

411
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:48,494
government.
Pay it immediately.

412
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:53,102
- Yes? - Sir, I am the manager
of the landlord of Haripur.

413
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:54,500
The landlord's daughter is
getting married.

414
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:57,513
We want ornaments worth
Rs 2,00,000 within fifteen days.

415
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,380
- You will get it within a week.
- Okay.

416
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:07,447
I'm sorry, you had to wait
because of me.

417
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,051
My prayers took long.
Please sit, teacher.

418
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,462
You didn't come home since
a week.

419
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:16,465
I was busy arranging a match
for my young daughter.

420
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:21,063
With great difficulty,
I found a nice family.

421
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:25,474
The boy is also good but their
demands are high.

422
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:30,413
I am a poor man.
I approached all my friends...

423
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,073
but they all refused.

424
00:39:33,484 --> 00:39:36,476
Teacher, when I am there why did
you have to go to others?

425
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,479
You can take as much money as
you want from me.

426
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:43,483
Son Raju, I am as such under
your obligation.

427
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:45,494
I don't want to trouble you
further.

428
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,088
This is no trouble.

429
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,092
Have you favored me any less.
I was a rustic.

430
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,095
And it was you who educated me.

431
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:58,100
You are my teacher.
The money will reach in the morning.

432
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,501
But along with the money,
you will have to pay the interest.

433
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:06,106
Thank you. But if you don't
mind, can I clear one thing?

434
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:09,111
- What will be the interest?
- The interest will be...

435
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:12,514
that you won't tell anyone that
you borrowed money from me...

436
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,113
for your daughter's marriage.

437
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,117
Your daughter is my sister.

438
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,461
So please accept this small
token from a brother.

439
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,123
Start the preparations for
the marriage.

440
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:49,149
"There will be food and drinks
aplenty...

441
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,155
for brother's marriage".

442
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:14,107
"Sing, dance and make merry".

443
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:46,548
"Rich people have come for
the marriage...

444
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:50,552
with heave paunches".

445
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:56,558
"They will lay their hands on
whatever they find".

446
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:01,097
"And will eat a week's meal
in a day".

447
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:07,096
"Marriages take place only once".

448
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:17,504
"So eat to your heart's content".

449
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:06,086
"The groom is so handsome...

450
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,433
as if the moon is shining on
the mare".

451
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:18,507
"The bride in the veil looks
as beautiful...

452
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,511
as the lightening hidden behind
the clouds".

453
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,452
"Both are just waiting for the
people to leave".

454
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:42,133
"So they can hug each other".

455
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:45,466
"Come, friends!"

456
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:28,103
Raju, you got my daughter
married with such pomp...

457
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,104
I don't have words to express
my gratitude.

458
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,110
Children, touch his feet.

459
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:38,520
May god keep you both
always happy!

460
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,519
Please show me this.

461
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:56,528
Make the bill.

462
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:08,074
Thief! Thief!

463
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:33,099
- Don't you dare touch me!
- Return the necklace.

464
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:37,504
Don't you know my name is
Lagga?

465
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:40,106
- I've committed six murders.
- That is not my concern.

466
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:44,110
- Return me the necklace.
- Take it if you dare.

467
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,525
The police is chasing him
since long.

468
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,527
Lagga, first give the necklace.

469
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,119
Hurry up!

470
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:01,070
Come with us to the police
station to lodge a complaint.

471
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:03,064
You leave, I'll follow in my car.

472
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:07,069
Raju, now your life is as much...

473
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,469
as the days I'll be in jail.

474
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,070
Come!

475
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,485
- Are you the owner of that shop?
- Yes.

476
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,480
- I think you didn't recognize me?
- Not at all.

477
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,083
- You too had once done me
a favor. - I?

478
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:27,089
A few years ago when I sold
fruits...

479
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:29,489
some of your friends stole
fruits from my cart.

480
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:31,423
And you paid for it.

481
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:38,508
Yes, I remember. But the fruit
cart to the jewellery shop!

482
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,509
How did all this happen so soon?

483
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,101
Do you want to know?

484
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:47,109
My friend is a magician.
He brought about this miracle.

485
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,508
- A magician?
- You won't understand.

486
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:54,113
Goodbye!

487
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,055
Can't you see?

488
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,061
Those who until yesterday bought
fruits from my shop and sold...

489
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,472
are today roaming in cars.

490
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,475
And look at my destiny!
I'm selling peanuts.

491
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,478
Narangi, you must be happy
at other's progress.

492
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,075
God gets angry with jealous
people.

493
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:24,079
He makes some paupers and some
rich!

494
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,078
Take Raju for example!

495
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,481
That chit of a man has reached
so far in life.

496
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:32,087
Narangi, I know the secret of
Raju's prosperity.

497
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,487
- Then tell me.
- Really?

498
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,091
Raju prayed to god with
absolute devotion.

499
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,504
He lit incense sticks daily in
the Krishna temple.

500
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,496
The lord was happy.

501
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:47,509
A rich man came who got
an epileptic fit there.

502
00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:51,504
Raju gave him an iron rod to
hold and his life was saved.

503
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:54,448
Out of happiness he gave Raju
ten thousand rupees.

504
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,520
- Ten thousand? - With that money
he started a shop for clarified

505
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:00,455
butter.
And the rest is history.

506
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:06,054
You know that I helped Raju
in his bad days.

507
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:08,053
Today I've fallen upon bad days.

508
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:12,467
Murti, can you tell Raju and
get me some money?

509
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:17,463
There is only one way to get
money out of Raju.

510
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,066
He is Krishna's devotee.
Go to him...

511
00:48:20,477 --> 00:48:23,071
and tell him that you beheld
the lord in your dreams.

512
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:27,407
And ordered you to take money from
Raju and start life afresh.

513
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:31,076
I won't give you the money.

514
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:35,483
Brother, when Lord Krishna appeared
in Narangi's dreams and...

515
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:39,494
asked her to borrow money from you
then how can you refuse?

516
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:45,093
Murti, the lord is in every
breath that I take.

517
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,095
Every fibre of my being prays
to him.

518
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:54,510
When after such devotion also
He didn't appear in my dreams...

519
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:57,512
then how can He appear in
Narangi's dreams, Murti?

520
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,449
If Lord Krishna wanted to help
Narangi...

521
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,044
why would He appear in her
dreams?

522
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:05,046
He would appear in my dreams.

523
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:10,049
If someone comes to me and says
that he is in trouble...

524
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,460
then I'd surely help them.

525
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:15,054
But if someone tries to
cheat me...

526
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:19,060
that too taking my Lord's name...

527
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,063
I won't get conned by them.

528
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:25,465
Brother Raju, I never wanted
to lie.

529
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:27,475
It was Murti who asked me
to say so.

530
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:30,413
Brother, please forgive me.

531
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,481
So you agree that you lied?

532
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:39,488
That's all. Now it is not
only my duty to help you...

533
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,079
but it is right also.

534
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:45,493
Besides you are the cause
of my first earnings.

535
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:48,086
I can never forget that favor.

536
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:53,092
A person who forgets a favor
is the greatest sinner.

537
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,496
Will Rs 2000 be enough?

538
00:49:57,107 --> 00:50:00,099
- Rs 2000 for each of us will be
fine. - Shut up!

539
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:01,502
Earlier also you ruined my
chances.

540
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,504
Brother, give as much as
you deem fit.

541
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:09,111
Narangi, take ten thousand
rupees.

542
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:11,510
Don't take it as a loan...

543
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,521
but it your own money.

544
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:17,119
And if in future you ever
need money...

545
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:22,522
for work then speak the
truth and take it.

546
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,139
Philanthropist!

547
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:45,545
Who are you? I am hearing
this word after very long.

548
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,556
Did you forget me? I am Raju,
the slave of your temple.

549
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,561
The thief of the diamond of
the lord's peacock crown.

550
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,157
Raju, don't embarrass me.

551
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,432
I realized my foolhardiness
after you left.

552
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:06,099
The next day the diamond was
found in a coconut at the lord's

553
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,102
feet.
- Forgive me, Raju.

554
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:11,513
- What is this you are doing?
You are begging to a slave?

555
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:18,112
God bless you. Son, I've heard
that you have become a big man.

556
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:22,458
Today I am pleased to see that
you really are a big man.

557
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:25,118
You must come to my house.

558
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,466
But son, I came here to meet
my daughter.

559
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:33,296
She studies in a college here.

560
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:36,538
My car broke down on the way
so I had to stop.

561
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:40,133
- I plan to leave today itself.
- Sir, the car is repaired.

562
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:46,139
- Sir, please come to my house.
- Alright!

563
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:50,143
- My humble abode is at Shyam
Niwas, Lawahar Road. - Alright.

564
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:52,554
- I'll come after a while.
- Thank you!

565
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:05,494
Lord, brother Raju lit incense
sticks worth only ten paise.

566
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:09,097
And you made him rich.

567
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:13,499
Now I've brought incense sticks
worth Rs 10,000 for you.

568
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:19,107
Lord, now you decide how
much money I should get.

569
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:40,125
Come, child!

570
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:46,131
He is Raju.

571
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,137
And she is my daughter
Savitri.

572
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:53,140
I know him very well.

573
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:56,551
- How do you know him? - I'll
tell you later first come in.

574
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:29,508
Do you want anything?

575
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,120
- What happened?
- Nothing.

576
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,121
- Then why this cough?
- It is fake.

577
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:45,525
There is nothing fake in this
house, so no fake coughs also.

578
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:51,133
Son, do you still remember
me by that old name?

579
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:54,542
Child, when he stayed in the
village...

580
00:53:55,546 --> 00:53:57,138
he'd address me by this name.

581
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:02,485
Child, why are you not eating?

582
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:05,076
I ate enough, father.

583
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:12,087
- Eat some sweets.
- No. Your talks are so sweet...

584
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:14,487
that I don't need sweets.

585
00:54:15,098 --> 00:54:16,497
- A little.
- Alright, keep it.

586
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:25,097
I have taken this decision after
a lot of thinking.

587
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:28,103
Philanthropist, you know that
I am an orphan.

588
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:31,105
Nothing is known about
my parents.

589
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:35,107
I grew up in the temple ringing
the temple bell.

590
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,518
How can I compare myself to you?

591
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:42,458
Son, wealth and prosperity
is the lord's grace.

592
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:45,117
Anybody can get it anytime.

593
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:49,530
And if the lord wills, then
wealth...

594
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:53,534
and prosperity can be lost
anytime.

595
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:59,532
A man's deeds and his
clean mind...

596
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:01,075
are a person's true wealth.

597
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,072
And this is the wealth which
once got...

598
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,073
can never be lost.

599
00:55:09,086 --> 00:55:13,079
And I don't have this wealth
as much as you have it.

600
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:16,491
Try to recollect that incident...

601
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:22,488
when I accused you of theft and
threw you out of the village.

602
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,489
Today the time has come...

603
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:28,096
when I must atone for it.

604
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:34,102
I have decided to get my
daughter married to you.

605
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:47,112
Savitri, can I ask you a
question?

606
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:54,120
How did you agree to marry a
man like me...

607
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:56,121
after being born to such
rich parents?

608
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:58,123
What are you saying?

609
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:02,401
A man who on the strength of his
hard word can achieve something...

610
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,472
such a man is worthy of worship.

611
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:07,466
You have fulfilled all the
dreams...

612
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:11,411
I had weaved for my life partner.

613
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:15,474
Savitri, only hardwork is not
required to become successful.

614
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:18,486
You need the lord's grace also.

615
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,458
Whatever I am today is because
of my Lord Krishna's grace.

616
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:25,493
Don't talk such things.

617
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:49,517
Before marriage I had made
a vow...

618
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:54,515
to visit the temple in my village
with my wife after marriage.

619
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:56,514
- So let's...
- Pardon me...

620
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:59,527
but I can't come.

621
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,066
Instead tonight my friends
have invited us for a party...

622
00:57:04,468 --> 00:57:05,457
to celebrate our marriage.

623
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,459
You will have to accompany me.

624
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:10,463
Savitri, I am asking you to
come to the temple.

625
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:13,065
And I am requesting you to
come for the party.

626
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:18,480
So you give priority to parties
over god?

627
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:20,472
I never said that.

628
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:23,075
The doors of a temple are
always open.

629
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:25,076
You can go there anytime.

630
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:29,490
But it is impolite to accept a
dinner invitation and cancel.

631
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:33,089
Don't make me fall in my
friend's eyes.

632
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:34,486
They will not understand
all this.

633
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:39,091
Look, your god can forgive you.

634
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:42,094
But my friends will never
forgive me.

635
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:46,098
You can pray to god in your
mind also.

636
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:51,103
Why go so far to the temple for
something that can be done at home?

637
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:52,504
Stop it, Savitri.

638
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:55,109
Don't anger my god further.

639
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,511
I just want to know if you will
come with me to the temple or no?

640
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,450
Pardon me but I won't be
able to come.

641
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:06,050
You are my god.

642
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:08,462
And I can see you.

643
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:11,055
So why should I believe in
a god...

644
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:15,064
whom not only me but nobody
has seen?

645
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,461
Savitri, are these really
your thoughts?

646
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,067
Is my wife telling me all this?

647
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:25,070
A husband and wife's relationship
is eternal.

648
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:29,415
They should have the freedom to
speak their mind.

649
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:34,079
Why put up a facade?

650
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:38,489
You know that my father is the
trustee of the temple.

651
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:41,487
But till today I have never
stepped into that temple.

652
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:44,088
Please don't misunderstand me.

653
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:48,502
You can follow your path.

654
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:51,095
And I will follow my path.

655
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:06,045
- Priest, where is Mr Pandey?
- Who Pandey?

656
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:10,051
My Baba, who for years has been
the priest of this temple.

657
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:13,453
He left the temple a few
years ago.

658
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:17,058
He left!
But why?

659
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,391
I heard a few years ago someone
called Raju lived here.

660
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,062
The landlord insulted him and
threw him out.

661
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,067
The next day Mr Pandey also
left.

662
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:52,491
My lord, my friend, my master,
Your Raju has come.

663
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,097
I have come in the clothes
I left in.

664
00:59:57,107 --> 00:59:59,507
Had I dressed up and come,
would You have liked it?

665
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:05,513
Would I show off to one who has
given me everything?

666
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:09,108
In your presence, even kings
and emperors are beggars...

667
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:10,441
then who am I?

668
01:00:11,454 --> 01:00:13,513
I have brought this gold
crown for you.

669
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:17,457
The gold is yours but the
devotion is mine.

670
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:24,123
"Chant Radhe Krishna"

671
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:37,536
"What else is divine?"

672
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:25,527
"Your name...

673
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:36,128
is the solution to all problems".

674
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:45,137
"Lose yourself to the lord".

675
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:23,108
"Devote yourself to the lord...

676
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:33,527
and make your heart His seat...

677
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:43,131
and lose yourself to the lord".

678
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:56,534
Fire!

679
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:04,077
I've burnt to ashes these incense
sticks worth ten thousand rupees.

680
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:07,479
Now this is my last packet.

681
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:12,086
Don't trouble me more and
fulfill my wish.

682
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,102
He's come.
I won't leave him.

683
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,108
Take this.

684
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:41,512
He went away!

685
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:51,125
So much money?

686
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:57,130
So much of money!

687
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,405
You do answer prayers maybe
late but never deny it.

688
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:08,073
How were your prayers?
Did it go off well?

689
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:11,419
Only I know the peace I get
from prayers.

690
01:05:12,088 --> 01:05:14,079
- How was your party?
- An accident took place.

691
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,084
A fire broke out and ruined
our fun.

692
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:21,427
How is Krishna connected
with the accident?

693
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:26,093
Why argue when you have no
faith in god?

694
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,438
This is the lord's offerings.
If you want to eat, do so...

695
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:33,097
or keep it in the prayer room.

696
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:45,451
- Are you Narangi? - Shut up!
I am Ms Narangi.

697
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:51,118
Actually it was below my dignity
to come to such a cheap market.

698
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:56,121
But I came to ask after my old
acquaintances.

699
01:05:57,533 --> 01:05:59,524
Mr Ramchandra, come here.

700
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,061
How is business?

701
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:05,065
Business is bad an I'm neck
deep in debts.

702
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:10,068
Why are you worried when I'm
there.

703
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:14,473
Take this.
Money begets money.

704
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:18,485
- Narangi, do me also a favor.
- Don't you dare call me Narangi.

705
01:06:19,422 --> 01:06:21,083
I am Ms Narangi.
Get lost!

706
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:26,087
- Ms Narangi, give me something.
- Yes, you called me Ms Narangi.

707
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:33,091
- I haven't paid the shop rent
for six months. - Take this.

708
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:40,508
Address me respectfully.
I'm no longer that old Narangi.

709
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,099
Why, what happened?

710
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:46,108
Talk to me respectfully.

711
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:51,510
- I am a millionaires now.
- How come!

712
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:57,117
Where did you get these
clothes from...

713
01:06:57,527 --> 01:06:58,516
and this bird's nest on your
head?

714
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:01,062
Until yesterday you were in an
ascetic's garb...

715
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:04,465
and today you look like
a film heroine.

716
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:08,060
How did all this happen?

717
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:10,063
All this is the lord's grace.

718
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:12,473
You must have conned him also.

719
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:16,068
Look, my time is getting over.

720
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:20,074
Don't waste my time.
Murti, I've so much wealth...

721
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:21,474
that I can't take care of it.

722
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:24,475
Will you become my secretary?

723
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:30,425
Yes. You are fourth pass and
still can't speak proper English.

724
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:34,086
- Will you?
- What work will I have to do?

725
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:38,090
Maintaining accounts.

726
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:44,096
- Maintaining accounts? - Yes and
buying cosmetics and toiletries.

727
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:49,511
And take the post-card of
those who come to meet me.

728
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:54,447
Alright, I get it.
But what will be the salary?

729
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:59,111
Two meals a day,
a good bath-room to stay...

730
01:07:59,522 --> 01:08:01,046
and fifteen hundred rupees.

731
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,458
- Fifty or hundred?
- Can't you understand English?

732
01:08:05,061 --> 01:08:06,050
- Five hundred rupees.
- Five hundred rupees.

733
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:09,053
Will I get some advance?

734
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:18,063
Take this Rs 500 and go make
a new suit.

735
01:08:18,474 --> 01:08:21,068
Come to my bungalow in a suit.

736
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:36,491
If you keep chanting god's name
all the while who'll do your work?

737
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:41,486
Savitri, allow me to take His
name who's given me name and fame.

738
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:45,499
You have slogged day and night
to make a name.

739
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,096
But it is god who gave the
strength to slog.

740
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:53,098
Savitri, it is man's duty to
work.

741
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,099
But it is in his hands to
give the fruits.

742
01:08:56,112 --> 01:08:59,104
If the watchman takes care
of the master...

743
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,039
won't the master also do
the same?

744
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:03,382
I can never win an argument
with you.

745
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:05,443
But I know...

746
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:08,447
that you will have to come to
the dining room for dinner.

747
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:12,050
God will not put food
into your mouth.

748
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:14,453
- Why not?
- Talks won't help.

749
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:18,465
If god can fill the coffers of
a man like me...

750
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:22,462
then if He wants he can feed
me here itself.

751
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:24,462
Then call out to him.

752
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:27,474
- Sir!
- Yes?

753
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:30,070
Sir, I got my son married.

754
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,071
As the marriage was in the
village, I couldn't invite you.

755
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,074
Please accept these sweets.

756
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:39,080
- A million congratulations!
- Thank you!

757
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:51,433
Did you see? God fills his
devotee's stomach here also.

758
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:56,503
If a parrot sitting on a mango
tree throws a mango at someone...

759
01:09:58,107 --> 01:09:59,506
it shouldn't be mistaken as
god's gift.

760
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:04,511
Coincidences are not called
divinity.

761
01:10:13,122 --> 01:10:16,523
Lord, you have spread awakening
all over.

762
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:20,462
But your this devotee can't
enlighten his wife.

763
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:24,523
Those people who tried to
enlighten atheist's about you...

764
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,527
must have faced so many trials.

765
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:50,492
Do policemen come to stitch
their uniforms here?

766
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:54,152
Have you come after duty
to buy clothes?

767
01:10:54,564 --> 01:10:55,553
We haven't come here to
buy clothes.

768
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:59,157
You must be thirsty so have
come to have a cold-drink.

769
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:01,500
Hurry up and order some
cold-drinks.

770
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:05,096
Or they'll get your boss
arrested for smuggling.

771
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:08,508
- Extend your hands.
- Do you know palmistry also?

772
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:11,102
See and forecast my future.

773
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:14,439
Your stars are changing.
Constable, handcuff him.

774
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:18,518
- He is innocent.
- I'm saying it for you not him.

775
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:20,520
The owner of the shop has
called us here.

776
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:23,523
The notes that you gave him
were counterfeit.

777
01:11:24,126 --> 01:11:25,115
Counterfeit money!

778
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:30,521
Welcome, aunt!

779
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:40,130
Take back your money.

780
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:43,134
Wait! What's wrong with my money
that you all are returning it?

781
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:46,478
Narangi, if you wanted to play
a prank...

782
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:48,548
you should have done it
with Murti. He's a bachelor.

783
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:52,143
- But we have families.
- But what is the matter?

784
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,546
- Where is Murti?
- The police has arrested him.

785
01:11:56,559 --> 01:11:57,548
Come here!

786
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,424
Narangi, you've come. You
should have come here before me.

787
01:12:01,097 --> 01:12:02,086
But they brought me first.

788
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,091
Who is the police to bring
me here?

789
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,493
- I came here on my own.
- Now I am convinced.

790
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:13,441
- Narangi, did you give me
those notes? - Yes.

791
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:17,102
Officer, note her statement.
I free myself.

792
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:20,107
- Not yet.
- Do you need bail?

793
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:25,110
- Don't open the bag. - Money is
not more important than you.

794
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:30,115
Officer, how much do you want?
Ten thousand, twenty thousand...

795
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:32,460
thirty thousand or fifty
thousand?

796
01:12:33,529 --> 01:12:35,463
Officer, same notes.

797
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:38,532
You arrested me for five notes.

798
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:41,126
Narangi has so many notes.
Will you hang her for this?

799
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,533
- Murti, he's telling you.
- I am already standing.

800
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:53,140
- Madam, you stand up.
- I?

801
01:12:53,549 --> 01:12:55,540
Tell me who gave you these
counterfeit notes?

802
01:12:56,485 --> 01:13:00,148
Counterfeit notes? Oh lord,
these are counterfeit notes!

803
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,081
I worshiped you with real notes.

804
01:13:03,492 --> 01:13:05,084
And in return you gave me
counterfeit notes.

805
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:08,088
Narangi, the fruits of fake worship
will be counterfeit notes.

806
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:09,486
Shut up!

807
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,499
Sir, the leader of the gang
manufacturing fake notes is nabbed.

808
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:15,502
- He is that man.
- Officer, it is him.

809
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:19,497
- Have you seen this girl?
- Yes, sir.

810
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:23,501
When I was running from the police
I took refuge in a temple.

811
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:27,505
I slipped on a banana skin
and fell.

812
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:30,108
I thought you got an epileptic
fit...

813
01:13:30,453 --> 01:13:33,115
so I came towards you with an
iron rod.

814
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:37,456
- Constable, put this man
behind bars. - Yes, sir.

815
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:40,517
You both can go.

816
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:45,123
But if required you will have
to come for testification.

817
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:58,545
It's midnight. Now go to sleep.

818
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,077
Don't you know I'm reading
the Bhagwad Gita?

819
01:14:04,086 --> 01:14:05,485
You can read it later.

820
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:10,084
Don't you get bored reading
the same book everyday?

821
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:16,087
Savitri, you drink tea daily.
And eat three meals a day.

822
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:18,498
You wake up in the morning
and sleep at night.

823
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:22,437
Do you get bored of this
routine?

824
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:25,505
What is life without
eating and sleeping?

825
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:29,100
So too my life is meaningless
without reading the Gita.

826
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,107
This is not a novel that can
be read and discarded.

827
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:37,108
The more you read it the
better you understand life.

828
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,111
Lust as eating, sleeping and
waking up is connected to life...

829
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:45,116
so too reading the Gita is
connected with the lord and the soul.

830
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:48,520
Again sermons. Nobody has
either seen god or the soul.

831
01:14:49,532 --> 01:14:54,128
- Will you read till morning?
- I'll read until I get sleep.

832
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,537
I am very sleepy.
Please come.

833
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,075
It isn't necessary for you to
keep awake for me.

834
01:15:01,477 --> 01:15:04,412
- You go and sleep.
- Alright!

835
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:51,115
- Are you hurt?
- What was to happen to me?

836
01:15:51,527 --> 01:15:53,119
Why are you trembling?

837
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:56,123
A goon attacked you with a knife.

838
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:58,121
Attacked me?

839
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:12,070
He attacked you but this book?

840
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:15,073
I was reading the Gita when
I fell asleep.

841
01:16:15,484 --> 01:16:17,475
The Gita was on my chest.

842
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:22,080
Had I not woken up, that goon
would have attacked you again.

843
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:24,491
It was my good fortune that you...

844
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:27,494
My lord will protect me.

845
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:31,091
The Gita shielded me from
the attack...

846
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,093
and saved my life.

847
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:38,496
- Or your husband...
- Don't say such things.

848
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:44,101
Now go to sleep.

849
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:49,507
Man sleeps and god keeps awake.

850
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:54,512
Until He wills otherwise
nobody can harm anybody.

851
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:59,119
How I wish somebody could have
teared my heart apart...

852
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:02,393
but not attacked my Bhagwad Gita.

853
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:14,065
- Sir, a saint has come to
meet you. - Saint?

854
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:30,083
- Seer!
- Get up, child.

855
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:31,481
Please sit.

856
01:17:32,494 --> 01:17:35,486
Today is such an auspicious day
that you came to my humble abode.

857
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:37,497
When He willed, I came.

858
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,094
Besides, I wanted to meet
you also, son.

859
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,097
Sage, I looked high and low
for you.

860
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,098
And seeing you here suddenly
today, I am elated.

861
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,510
It was you who guided me
correctly towards god.

862
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:54,105
Today my lord has made me
prosper so much.

863
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:57,507
It is all His grace.

864
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,111
Son, do you re-collect
I once told you...

865
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:04,052
- that the lord is a slave to his
devotees. - Yes, I remember.

866
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,461
But when I saw 'Shyam Niwas'
written outside your house...

867
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:10,454
I was very happy.

868
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:14,058
Now Shyam resides not only in
your house but your heart also.

869
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:18,471
I can see that you are totally
devoted to your lord.

870
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:22,069
Sage, your preachings helped me.

871
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:25,072
The lamp of faith that you
lit within me...

872
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,472
has brightened my life.

873
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:30,475
I don't have words to sing your
glories.

874
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:36,084
Son, glories are sung of the
lord not of a mortal.

875
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:40,493
And I am just a speck in this
material world.

876
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:44,489
That day when you met me
you were in darkness...

877
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:50,495
do you remember I told you that if
you repose your faith in the lord...

878
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,101
he will surely come to your help.

879
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:57,104
Gurudev, you were right.
All this is the lord's grace.

880
01:18:57,513 --> 01:19:01,040
I have a flourishing business and
there is no dearth of wealth.

881
01:19:02,051 --> 01:19:04,042
And I have a nice, beautiful
wife.

882
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:06,377
If you don't mind,
I'll bring her to you.

883
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:09,047
With your blessings her life will
also become complete.

884
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:11,048
Bring her.

885
01:19:13,062 --> 01:19:17,055
People say that science is
making people atheist.

886
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:20,057
It is so heartening to know...

887
01:19:21,403 --> 01:19:24,065
that good people like Raju
still exist...

888
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:29,069
who have surrendered themselves
completely to the lord.

889
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:34,246
Savitri, come, a great soul
has come to our house.

890
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,483
He is a great saint.

891
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,078
Come and touch his feet and
seek his blessings.

892
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:48,496
I am not interested in touching
any saint's feet.

893
01:19:49,098 --> 01:19:51,089
- He's not an ordinary man.
- So what happens?

894
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:53,492
A man doesn't become great by
chanting and applying ash.

895
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:57,095
Talk softly.
Your words will hurt him.

896
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:58,495
It makes no difference to me.

897
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:02,102
Look, you keep all this to
yourself.

898
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,503
Lust come once and meet him.

899
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:09,107
I can give my life on your
one indication.

900
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:13,111
But I can't believe in this
blind faith.

901
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:09,510
Child, I heard your and your
wife's conversation.

902
01:21:10,445 --> 01:21:11,503
But don't despair.

903
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:15,506
A husband wife relationship dates
back to several births.

904
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:18,518
Consider this difference of
opinion...

905
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:22,113
as a flaw of the material world.

906
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:26,526
One day fate will bring your
thoughts closer.

907
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,122
Lust as one day you lost
faith in god...

908
01:21:32,534 --> 01:21:34,525
and you atoned for that
mistake.

909
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:40,131
So too Lord Krishna will one day
clear all your wife's doubts.

910
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:06,500
Because of your whim, a great soul
left my house dissatisfied.

911
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,493
I couldn't even serve him.

912
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:14,507
If he is a true saint why does
he need you to honor him?

913
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,501
Had you told me an elderly
person has come...

914
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:21,107
I'd have come and touched
his feet.

915
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:26,114
But I don't want to apply the dirt
from the saints's feet on my

916
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:28,113
forehead.
Savitri, the feet which you

917
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:30,115
call dirty...
have become dirty in the

918
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:34,118
pursuit of god.
You are my wife. And the man

919
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:36,121
whom your husband respects...
it is your duty to respect

920
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:39,125
that man.
My duty is to only respect you.

921
01:22:40,535 --> 01:22:44,528
You are my husband and are
responsible for me.

922
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,134
If there is a god for me
then it is you.

923
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:51,478
Had I been your god,
wouldn't you have obeyed me?

924
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:57,541
I can place my head on your
feet several times in a day.

925
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:01,081
But I won't bow down to a
stranger only because...

926
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:06,493
he is wearing sandalwood
paste and is an ascetic.

927
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:12,499
Pardon me but you see god even
in beggars wandering the streets.

928
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:14,500
Savitri, you are a fool.

929
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:19,096
The man I consider a saint, you
call him a beggar on the streets!?

930
01:23:19,508 --> 01:23:21,100
If our thoughts are so
different...

931
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:23,502
peace and happiness can never
prevail in this house.

932
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:29,106
At times I wonder that in this
age of technology...

933
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:34,114
there are people like you also who
believe in old dogmas.

934
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:36,115
It is because of such people...

935
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,119
that the world is what it is.

936
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:42,520
You are surrounded by
illusions. You have traumas.

937
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:47,124
And you remember those illusions
and fear as god.

938
01:23:47,536 --> 01:23:50,130
- Is illusion and fear god?
- What else?

939
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:52,538
Like you always say...

940
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:56,133
that god is everywhere...

941
01:23:56,545 --> 01:24:01,073
- isn't it an illusion? - Then tell
me a place where god doesn't exist?

942
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,078
You tell me a place where god
exists.

943
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:06,078
There is no place where
god doesn't exist.

944
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,480
God exists even in this paper.

945
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:15,086
- Why are you laughing?
- God exists in this paper also!

946
01:24:15,497 --> 01:24:18,091
Yes, it was made and will be
destroyed only by His will.

947
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,094
This is also one of your
illusions which has no basis.

948
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,097
This is a fact and not
my illusion.

949
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:26,100
I can prove it that god exists
in this paper.

950
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:31,105
- Impossible!
- Then, can you destroy it?

951
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:36,110
In times of atom bombs when a single
bomb can blast an entire nation...

952
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:37,507
- can't this paper be destroyed?
- No!

953
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,109
We'll see.

954
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:50,462
Now say.
Answer me.

955
01:24:55,537 --> 01:24:58,529
Savitri, you can't destroy it.

956
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,473
By tearing it,
you have changed its form.

957
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:05,071
Earlier it was one paper now
there are many pieces of it.

958
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,471
But it is still a paper.

959
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:13,419
Only god has the power to make
or destroy anything.

960
01:25:14,089 --> 01:25:16,489
This is just a superstition
not an argument.

961
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:20,425
How do I make you understand?
It is very simple.

962
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,488
If there is no god...

963
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:24,497
then where did this earth and
sky come from?

964
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,489
I'll explain.

965
01:25:27,502 --> 01:25:29,094
The sun rotates.

966
01:25:30,105 --> 01:25:32,096
And parts of it keep falling.

967
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:35,101
One part of it kept cooling
for long...

968
01:25:35,477 --> 01:25:37,104
and became the earth.

969
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:43,451
1/3rd part became the land
and the remaining the sea.

970
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:47,520
With climatic changes insects
and worms were born on land...

971
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:49,512
and fishes in the sea.

972
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:54,518
Along with small animals big
animals were also formed.

973
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,519
One of them was monkeys.

974
01:25:58,133 --> 01:26:03,070
After years of evolution a new form
took shape from the monkeys...

975
01:26:03,472 --> 01:26:05,463
and became a human-being.

976
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:08,474
This is not my theory.

977
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:13,074
But the theory of evolution by
the great scientist Charles Darwin.

978
01:26:14,483 --> 01:26:17,077
Very good! This is what your
education has taught you.

979
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:22,481
But whose wish was it that a
part of the sun become the earth?

980
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:25,426
Why weren't the worms not born
in the sea instead of land?

981
01:26:26,495 --> 01:26:28,486
And why weren't the fishes not
born on land instead of the sea?

982
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:31,088
Trees were born but where did
the seed come from?

983
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:34,095
As per your education the sun
is the seed for everything.

984
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:36,092
Okay...

985
01:26:37,105 --> 01:26:39,505
and I consider that seed,
that sun as god.

986
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:41,498
- You also accept it.
- No!

987
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:45,105
Sun is the sun,
it can't become god.

988
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:48,108
So were Ram, Lesus, Mohammed
nothing?

989
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:50,448
Was there nobody to kill Kansa?

990
01:26:51,453 --> 01:26:52,511
Was the war between Kauravas
and Pandavas a myth?

991
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:55,114
Is the Mahabharat a figment of
imagination?

992
01:26:55,524 --> 01:26:58,516
Did Krishna not preach the
Bhagwad Gita to Arjuna?

993
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:01,391
- There was neither any Krishna nor
Arjuna. - What did you say?

994
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:04,056
- There was no Krishna?
- No.

995
01:27:04,466 --> 01:27:06,457
- No?
- No! No!

996
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:08,467
No! No!

997
01:27:11,072 --> 01:27:15,475
Kill me if you want but I'll
still stand by my belief.

998
01:27:16,478 --> 01:27:18,469
A married woman's god is her
husband.

999
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:21,073
If you don't agree with my
belief...

1000
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:27,480
then go and ask a saint or seer
if what I said is untrue.

1001
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,425
If god really exists, even he
can't challenge my statement.

1002
01:27:32,494 --> 01:27:36,089
That after marriage a husband
is a wife's god.

1003
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:40,491
You are ready to accept a
mortal as god.

1004
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:44,503
But you don't want to accept the
one who made mortals, god?

1005
01:27:45,106 --> 01:27:48,507
We can never get long.
Our relationship is over.

1006
01:27:49,511 --> 01:27:52,105
You won't find god by leaving me.

1007
01:27:52,514 --> 01:27:55,506
Leave me.
You have insulted my Krishna.

1008
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:59,510
You are no longer my wife.
Leave me.

1009
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:03,056
- Leave me.
- Listen to me.

1010
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:22,475
You are just a statue.

1011
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:26,070
But my god considers you
as god.

1012
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:31,077
And today without understanding
me he discarded me.

1013
01:28:32,487 --> 01:28:33,476
He is your devotee.

1014
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:36,423
You are the cause of our rift.

1015
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:42,086
You are standing in the way
of two people in love.

1016
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:48,492
There is no place for you here.
I won't keep you here.

1017
01:29:07,455 --> 01:29:08,444
Father!

1018
01:29:09,457 --> 01:29:12,449
As there was no news from you
for so many days...

1019
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:15,393
I was coming to meet you...

1020
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,054
and I met Raju on the way.

1021
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:23,401
- I have heard everything.
- What did he say?

1022
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:26,064
He gave me the picture of
the rift.

1023
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:32,069
Raju said now he can no longer
stay with you.

1024
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:36,073
And he has candidly asked me...

1025
01:29:37,485 --> 01:29:39,077
to take my daughter home.

1026
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:43,489
He thinks that is best for
both of you.

1027
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:47,484
Savitri, did I educate you...

1028
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:51,088
so that after marriage you
create a rift...

1029
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,091
between you and your husband
over a minor argument?

1030
01:29:55,503 --> 01:29:59,098
After marriage it is every
girl's duty...

1031
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:03,104
to see and gauge her husband's
every need...

1032
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:06,105
and to adapt herself to his
ways.

1033
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:09,108
Savitri, you are so lucky...

1034
01:30:09,517 --> 01:30:11,451
to get a husband like Raju.

1035
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,111
And you fail to understand him.

1036
01:30:14,522 --> 01:30:19,516
Can't you adopt his beliefs?

1037
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:26,123
After marriage a father has no
right to teach his daughter.

1038
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:28,525
But yet for your good I
am telling you...

1039
01:30:29,537 --> 01:30:34,133
that to make a success of marriage
you have to tread very cautiously.

1040
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:38,544
Rest is upto you.
I'll leave now.

1041
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:45,543
- Father!
- Son, I've told her as much as...

1042
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:47,143
a father can make his daughter
understand.

1043
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:49,145
Now allow me to go.

1044
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:55,152
Savitri, there is no need for
you to give any explanations.

1045
01:30:55,563 --> 01:30:56,552
But listen...

1046
01:30:57,565 --> 01:31:00,159
hereafter I'll step into this
house only when...

1047
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:03,502
Raju sends me a message...

1048
01:31:04,105 --> 01:31:06,505
that you have bowed to his wish.

1049
01:31:07,108 --> 01:31:09,508
And that now there is no
differences between you two.

1050
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:15,506
Until then neither are you my
daughter nor am I your father.

1051
01:31:23,525 --> 01:31:29,122
- Pardon me.
- What for?

1052
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:34,124
I never hid anything from you
nor will I ever.

1053
01:31:35,136 --> 01:31:37,127
When you left in anger...

1054
01:31:38,139 --> 01:31:39,538
I lost my composure...

1055
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:46,139
and I wanted to throw the idol
of your Lord Krishna.

1056
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:49,139
Sinner! You dared to touch my
Lord.

1057
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:54,554
When someone is speaking the truth
you must listen to them calmly.

1058
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:59,152
When I was about to do it,
I heard the horn.

1059
01:32:00,428 --> 01:32:02,419
And I thought that you had come.

1060
01:32:03,498 --> 01:32:06,490
My body started shaking...

1061
01:32:07,502 --> 01:32:08,491
and I came back.

1062
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:11,435
Did you got scared of the
lord's anger?

1063
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:16,102
I am your slave but our life...

1064
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,103
comes to a halt at one point.

1065
01:32:19,113 --> 01:32:22,105
And that point is god.

1066
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:25,509
Think rationally and tell me...

1067
01:32:27,121 --> 01:32:31,125
have I ever failed in my
duties as a wife?

1068
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:35,118
If I haven't then what is the
cause of this rift?

1069
01:32:37,131 --> 01:32:41,534
I want to ask you...

1070
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:44,536
just as you ask me everyday...

1071
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:50,133
to pray and worship god...

1072
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:55,540
similarly if I, as a wife
also ask you...

1073
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:59,145
to forsake worshiping god.
Will you do it?

1074
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:00,418
How can I leave my god?

1075
01:33:01,489 --> 01:33:08,486
Lust as you can't leave your god
how can I leave my habits and nature?

1076
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,093
To worship is a habit and
not to worship is also a habit.

1077
01:33:13,501 --> 01:33:15,492
It is our duty and not habit
to believe in god.

1078
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:19,505
Why are you harping on it
so much?

1079
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:24,103
We have everything in this house.
The only problem is...

1080
01:33:25,113 --> 01:33:26,512
if god exists or no.

1081
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:29,107
You continue to believe that god
exists.

1082
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:33,110
And I'll continue to believe
that you are my god.

1083
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:39,522
Like other couples have we spent
even a day happily?

1084
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:46,125
If we want we can happily
accept each other's views.

1085
01:33:47,135 --> 01:33:52,129
Child, I heard your conversation
with your wife.

1086
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,529
Don't despair.

1087
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:57,534
A husband wife relationship
dates back to several births.

1088
01:33:58,546 --> 01:34:00,411
Consider this difference of
opinion...

1089
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:04,483
as a drawback of your married
life.

1090
01:34:05,486 --> 01:34:08,478
One day fate will bring your
thoughts closer.

1091
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:13,483
Lust as one day you lost
faith in god...

1092
01:34:14,495 --> 01:34:16,486
and then atoned for it.

1093
01:34:17,098 --> 01:34:22,092
So too, one day Lord Krishna
will clear your wife's doubts.

1094
01:34:24,356 --> 01:34:27,348
Savitri, you are right.

1095
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,351
Until you don't believe in god...

1096
01:34:30,763 --> 01:34:33,357
I will not compel you to
worship him.

1097
01:34:34,366 --> 01:34:37,358
And hereafter we will not fight
on this issue.

1098
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:43,708
Then for a few days let's go
to some hill-station.

1099
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,768
Alright, I'll make the
necessary arrangements.

1100
01:34:47,379 --> 01:34:48,778
And write to father also.

1101
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:52,782
- What for?
- Father and daughter must re-unite.

1102
01:34:53,385 --> 01:34:56,377
I'll also write to him about
the ceasefire.

1103
01:34:57,389 --> 01:35:00,381
- He'll feel better.
- I thought something else.

1104
01:35:01,393 --> 01:35:03,384
That father will also join us?

1105
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:31,755
"When the heart bonds with
the heart...

1106
01:35:34,693 --> 01:35:38,754
then love becomes sublime".

1107
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:49,363
"When the beloved becomes
a part of life...

1108
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:55,369
then love becomes eternal".

1109
01:36:18,403 --> 01:36:21,395
- What are you thinking?
- The heart has bonded with the

1110
01:36:22,674 --> 01:36:25,336
heart.
Then love becomes sublime.

1111
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:30,748
- And you?
- I was thinking...

1112
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:33,341
when the beloved becomes a
part of life...

1113
01:36:35,354 --> 01:36:36,753
Iove becomes eternal.

1114
01:36:37,356 --> 01:36:41,759
"A flower asked a bird...

1115
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:45,762
where does love reside?"

1116
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:56,366
"The bird cut her heart and
replied...

1117
01:36:57,376 --> 01:37:00,777
Iove resides here".

1118
01:37:06,385 --> 01:37:10,389
"The ocean is the destination
of the river. And the...

1119
01:37:10,389 --> 01:37:16,726
destination of love is the
beloved's heart".

1120
01:37:52,364 --> 01:37:56,357
"The birds flying in the
azure sky...

1121
01:37:56,768 --> 01:38:00,363
sing the song of love".

1122
01:38:06,378 --> 01:38:10,781
"Either make someone yours...

1123
01:38:11,383 --> 01:38:14,784
or you become someone's."

1124
01:38:20,392 --> 01:38:26,729
"If there is no family...

1125
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:32,326
Love too can't exist there".

1126
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:18,375
- Sir! - You got married and
took heavy loans.

1127
01:39:18,784 --> 01:39:21,378
But you don't want to pay my
rent of four months.

1128
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,713
A man who gets married on loans,
how can he pay your rent?

1129
01:39:26,391 --> 01:39:28,382
If you took loans you should
have paid my rent.

1130
01:39:28,794 --> 01:39:31,786
Then you should have married
Narangi?

1131
01:39:32,397 --> 01:39:35,730
Sir, go home;
your wife must be waiting for you.

1132
01:39:36,401 --> 01:39:37,800
In two days,
I'll pay every penny of yours.

1133
01:39:39,404 --> 01:39:40,393
Damn you!

1134
01:39:43,408 --> 01:39:44,807
Sir, did you also hear what
I told him?

1135
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:48,803
So you too...
Sensible people!

1136
01:39:50,415 --> 01:39:52,406
- Narangi, come. - Why do you
listen to all these taunts?

1137
01:39:52,751 --> 01:39:55,413
Take a loan from brother Raju
and pay them off.

1138
01:39:55,821 --> 01:39:58,415
I know he won't return me
empty-handed.

1139
01:39:58,824 --> 01:40:00,416
But I become tongue tied
in his presence.

1140
01:40:01,827 --> 01:40:03,818
If you open your mouth,
your luck will also open.

1141
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:05,418
They have returned from their
holiday.

1142
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:08,766
We must take their blessings
also.

1143
01:40:09,768 --> 01:40:10,826
Let's go.

1144
01:40:13,438 --> 01:40:16,430
Savitri, we left for a ten
days holiday...

1145
01:40:17,442 --> 01:40:18,431
but it's three months now.

1146
01:40:18,844 --> 01:40:20,436
And yet it looks as if it
were yesterday.

1147
01:40:21,446 --> 01:40:26,383
But these three months have
done us a lot of good.

1148
01:40:26,785 --> 01:40:31,779
That is fine. But I'll have to
make up for the lost time...

1149
01:40:33,392 --> 01:40:34,381
and will lose all the charm.

1150
01:40:35,394 --> 01:40:39,387
Work and rest both are equally
important in life.

1151
01:40:39,798 --> 01:40:45,395
- Murti will come so deal with
him the way I told you. - Okay.

1152
01:40:45,804 --> 01:40:51,401
Raju will soon come, so do as
I told you and lie down flat.

1153
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:54,402
- How will that help?
- You are so dumb.

1154
01:40:55,414 --> 01:40:56,403
He's come.

1155
01:41:00,419 --> 01:41:01,408
Get up, Murti.

1156
01:41:05,424 --> 01:41:10,418
Lord, pardon us for marrying
in brother Raju's absence.

1157
01:41:10,829 --> 01:41:12,421
There is no need to
apologize, Murti.

1158
01:41:13,432 --> 01:41:14,831
I was very happy to hear it.

1159
01:41:15,434 --> 01:41:18,426
That's good but without you
we didn't enjoy.

1160
01:41:18,837 --> 01:41:21,829
Actually it was an auspicious time
and everyone was getting married.

1161
01:41:22,441 --> 01:41:23,373
There was one in our
neighborhood also.

1162
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:26,768
So we borrowed their garlands.

1163
01:41:27,379 --> 01:41:30,780
The priest was leaving. We asked
him to perform our marriage also.

1164
01:41:32,384 --> 01:41:35,376
We paid in Rs 1.25. He was leaving
after two circumambulation...

1165
01:41:35,787 --> 01:41:38,779
I asked him why. He said this is
all he can do in quarter rate.

1166
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:40,790
The rest we did it ourselves.

1167
01:41:41,393 --> 01:41:43,384
A band was passing by from
our house.

1168
01:41:43,728 --> 01:41:46,788
We asked him to play for
us also for a while.

1169
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:49,390
He did so and we paid him a
rupee for it.

1170
01:41:50,402 --> 01:41:53,394
And people thought the band had
come for our marriage.

1171
01:41:53,738 --> 01:41:55,399
Atleast you got married.

1172
01:41:55,807 --> 01:41:59,402
Murti, I've come back after long, so
there's lot of work. I'll leave.

1173
01:41:59,744 --> 01:42:00,733
Congratulations for your marriage!

1174
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:07,408
He left!
He didn't even open his bag.

1175
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:13,416
Sister-in-law, she is my
Narangi.

1176
01:42:13,825 --> 01:42:14,814
I mean my wife Narangi.

1177
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:18,828
What is this you are doing?
Get up!

1178
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:23,367
Be happy!
This is for you.

1179
01:42:29,374 --> 01:42:33,708
Murti, didn't I tell you that
sister-in-law is very generous?

1180
01:42:34,379 --> 01:42:36,370
Narangi, what is this?

1181
01:42:37,382 --> 01:42:43,378
I told her that brother Raju
is very large hearted.

1182
01:42:43,722 --> 01:42:47,783
Infact he only asked me
to give you this gift.

1183
01:42:48,393 --> 01:42:50,384
He told you?
Didn't I say so?

1184
01:42:50,795 --> 01:42:53,730
Now you shift into the outhouse.

1185
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:59,395
- Brother told this? Did you
hear? - Yes, I heard.

1186
01:42:59,804 --> 01:43:01,795
Both of them are good.

1187
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:07,810
You are very smart.
You buttered both of them.

1188
01:43:11,816 --> 01:43:15,809
- Doctor, what happened?
- First offer me some sweets.

1189
01:43:16,821 --> 01:43:20,814
There is no dearth of sweets.
It is the lord's offerings.

1190
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:25,353
- Tell me. - Raju, you will
be pleased to hear...

1191
01:43:25,764 --> 01:43:26,753
that your family will now
increase.

1192
01:43:46,384 --> 01:43:49,376
What you couldn't say you asked
the doctor to say it.

1193
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:54,782
- Is it true?
- Do doctors also lie?

1194
01:43:55,794 --> 01:43:57,785
Is that so?

1195
01:44:04,402 --> 01:44:08,805
Don't show me your teeth.
I know you brush your teeth twice.

1196
01:44:09,407 --> 01:44:10,806
Don't torture me.

1197
01:44:11,409 --> 01:44:15,743
I rarely get into the mood
and you run away from me.

1198
01:44:16,414 --> 01:44:19,406
I don't like your stupid
laughter.

1199
01:44:19,818 --> 01:44:23,345
It's just a month to the marriage
and you don't like my laughter.

1200
01:44:24,356 --> 01:44:27,348
How can I make you happy?

1201
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,759
- Shall I tell you?
- Yes.

1202
01:44:31,363 --> 01:44:36,357
I want... that.

1203
01:44:39,371 --> 01:44:45,367
Other men's wives demand ornaments
and clothes from their husbands.

1204
01:44:45,777 --> 01:44:48,371
And you want just a calendar?

1205
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:52,375
I'll floor you with such
calendars.

1206
01:44:52,717 --> 01:44:54,378
You are such a dimwit.

1207
01:44:54,786 --> 01:44:59,382
I don't want a calendar but a child
like the one in the calendar.

1208
01:44:59,791 --> 01:45:02,783
- Impossible!
- Why?

1209
01:45:03,395 --> 01:45:07,388
- How will it happen? - Like brother
Raju you also fast once a week.

1210
01:45:07,799 --> 01:45:11,394
- And you? - Like sister in law,
I'll eat raw mangoes.

1211
01:45:11,803 --> 01:45:14,397
You want to keep me hungry and
eat mangoes yourself.

1212
01:45:14,806 --> 01:45:18,401
Parents have to do a lot to
beget a child.

1213
01:45:18,810 --> 01:45:20,801
- You will have to fast!
- Oh, yeah!

1214
01:45:23,748 --> 01:45:25,739
This fair child seems to be
a foreigner's.

1215
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:28,742
And I...
How is it possible?

1216
01:45:39,364 --> 01:45:42,697
Lord, let my lineage continue.

1217
01:45:53,378 --> 01:45:55,369
- A son is born.
- A son!

1218
01:45:59,384 --> 01:46:03,377
- Raju, congratulation!
A son is born. - Really!

1219
01:46:12,397 --> 01:46:14,797
Raju sir, I've never come across
such a delivery case.

1220
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,792
Thank god your wife's life
was saved.

1221
01:46:19,404 --> 01:46:22,396
My wife's life is saved?
And my child?

1222
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,733
The child's limbs are not working.

1223
01:46:25,343 --> 01:46:30,679
Unfortunately, in the womb itself
the child was struck with paralysis.

1224
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,681
He will be almost lifeless.

1225
01:48:13,384 --> 01:48:16,785
Forgive me.
Your dream was fulfilled...

1226
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:22,385
but in such a way that it was
better not to open the eyes.

1227
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:28,732
We were so eager to play
with our son.

1228
01:48:30,335 --> 01:48:32,735
But a son was born but...

1229
01:48:34,339 --> 01:48:37,672
Savitri, it is not your fault.
This is destiny.

1230
01:48:39,744 --> 01:48:44,340
You can't fight fate.

1231
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:48,342
Whether the news is good or bad,
you can't fight fate.

1232
01:48:49,754 --> 01:48:51,346
You may call it destiny.

1233
01:48:53,358 --> 01:48:57,351
But I'll consider it to be some
problem arising in the womb...

1234
01:48:57,762 --> 01:48:59,354
for such a child to
be born.

1235
01:48:59,764 --> 01:49:01,755
Savitri, No.
I am sure...

1236
01:49:03,368 --> 01:49:05,359
because you never believed in
the supremacy of the lord...

1237
01:49:06,371 --> 01:49:08,771
so he has punished you thus.

1238
01:49:09,774 --> 01:49:14,768
Punishment? Alright, I agree
that your lord punished me...

1239
01:49:16,381 --> 01:49:17,780
because I didn't believe in him.

1240
01:49:18,716 --> 01:49:21,776
But you believe in him.

1241
01:49:23,788 --> 01:49:26,382
Then why did your benevolent
lord punish you thus?

1242
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:29,783
Isn't he not your son also?

1243
01:49:31,796 --> 01:49:36,790
Answer me. Why are you silent?
Where is your lord now?

1244
01:49:37,402 --> 01:49:38,391
Ask him!

1245
01:49:43,741 --> 01:49:46,801
Lord, I don't want anything
for myself.

1246
01:49:48,413 --> 01:49:49,402
You have given me everything.

1247
01:49:50,415 --> 01:49:53,407
But how do I reply to
my wife's barbs?

1248
01:49:53,751 --> 01:49:58,814
She's asks me to ask you is this
the fruits of my lifetime's devotion?

1249
01:50:00,425 --> 01:50:04,418
Lord, she maybe an atheist but
what she is saying is true.

1250
01:50:04,829 --> 01:50:08,424
I don't have any answer to
give her.

1251
01:50:09,434 --> 01:50:12,835
You are omniscient and you
protect everyone.

1252
01:50:13,771 --> 01:50:16,831
I am confident that you will
surely help my son.

1253
01:50:17,442 --> 01:50:21,845
But make her also understand
who is doubting my devotion.

1254
01:50:24,382 --> 01:50:28,785
Narangi, wear these flowers in your
hair and dress in this jeans.

1255
01:50:29,387 --> 01:50:31,787
Do you want to ridicule me
in this age?

1256
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:33,379
But this is a modern dress?

1257
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:36,384
This looks stupid to me.

1258
01:50:37,395 --> 01:50:41,388
I weave such wonderful dreams
but you dash all of them.

1259
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,803
The one who feed us are again
having the same problem.

1260
01:51:10,828 --> 01:51:13,763
In my experience, I don't think
this child's limbs can ever work.

1261
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:16,822
Is there no cure for this?

1262
01:51:18,836 --> 01:51:22,431
There is a specialist for this
disease, Dr Mohanlal.

1263
01:51:23,374 --> 01:51:25,774
- Seek his advise.
- You please call him.

1264
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:49,798
I think this disease is
incurable.

1265
01:51:51,803 --> 01:51:55,739
Incurable? If I take a second
opinion...

1266
01:51:56,808 --> 01:51:58,400
will my son be cured?

1267
01:52:14,425 --> 01:52:15,414
Go to sleep!

1268
01:52:20,431 --> 01:52:22,695
Sleep, my child!

1269
01:52:44,789 --> 01:52:47,781
"Oh my child!"

1270
01:53:03,407 --> 01:53:09,403
"Every mother...

1271
01:53:10,815 --> 01:53:15,809
sings a lullaby to her son
to put him to sleep".

1272
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:35,362
"I am the only...

1273
01:53:36,374 --> 01:53:38,774
unfortunate mother...

1274
01:53:39,377 --> 01:53:44,781
who sings a lullaby to wake
her son".

1275
01:54:10,808 --> 01:54:16,804
"When will this day end and
that day dawn...

1276
01:54:17,815 --> 01:54:19,806
when my son...

1277
01:54:21,419 --> 01:54:23,683
will open his eyes"?

1278
01:54:28,759 --> 01:54:31,353
"There will be celebration
in the air...

1279
01:54:32,363 --> 01:54:35,355
my motherhood will cherish...

1280
01:54:35,766 --> 01:54:38,360
when he will play...

1281
01:54:39,704 --> 01:54:42,366
in my courtyard".

1282
01:54:42,707 --> 01:54:46,370
"An anguished mother...

1283
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:54,774
is eagerly waiting since so long".

1284
01:55:27,752 --> 01:55:30,744
"Why isn't the season...

1285
01:55:31,355 --> 01:55:34,347
changing...

1286
01:55:34,759 --> 01:55:37,751
and there is a shower...

1287
01:55:38,362 --> 01:55:40,762
of rain in my courtyard"?

1288
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:48,364
"I am a mother...

1289
01:55:48,773 --> 01:55:55,372
yet I am yearning for my child...

1290
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:58,371
to call out 'mother' to me".

1291
01:55:59,784 --> 01:56:02,776
"How can a hapless mother...

1292
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:11,794
find peace?"

1293
01:57:40,751 --> 01:57:43,686
After examining the child we
doctors have come to the

1294
01:57:44,355 --> 01:57:45,754
conclusion...
that this disease is incurable.

1295
01:57:48,759 --> 01:57:50,750
In today's times when science
has advanced so much...

1296
01:57:52,363 --> 01:57:53,352
when there are heart and
eye transplants...

1297
01:57:54,765 --> 01:57:56,357
then can't my son be cured?

1298
01:57:57,768 --> 01:57:58,757
This is beyond our power.

1299
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:01,362
Only god can save your child.

1300
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,721
All doctors have given up hopes.

1301
01:58:29,733 --> 01:58:31,325
But one doctor is still
remaining...

1302
01:58:32,736 --> 01:58:34,727
who gives pain and cures it also.

1303
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:40,743
Savitri, you consider me as
your god, isn't it?

1304
01:58:41,745 --> 01:58:46,341
Then trust me and repose your
faith in my god for a while.

1305
01:58:47,751 --> 01:58:50,743
Savitri, faith is such a
thing...

1306
01:58:51,355 --> 01:58:53,346
that can spring a shower of
milk from mountains.

1307
01:58:54,358 --> 01:58:57,759
I'm not saying this to make
you believe in god.

1308
01:58:58,762 --> 01:59:00,354
But for our son's sake.

1309
01:59:03,367 --> 01:59:07,360
We can't bear to see each
other's pain.

1310
01:59:08,372 --> 01:59:10,772
Our pain is shared.

1311
01:59:11,775 --> 01:59:15,370
Savitri, you don't know the
power of chanting.

1312
01:59:17,381 --> 01:59:20,373
If you are a mother,
then just once heed my advise.

1313
01:59:21,785 --> 01:59:23,719
I am ready to do whatever
you say.

1314
01:59:24,788 --> 01:59:27,780
I'll come wherever you ask
me to come.

1315
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:30,384
So, will you come with me
for a pilgrimage?

1316
01:59:31,395 --> 01:59:35,456
Yes, not for myself but
for my son.

1317
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,800
Every mother can go to any
lengths for her child.

1318
01:59:40,404 --> 01:59:43,396
I too am a mother and am no
different.

1319
01:59:43,741 --> 01:59:44,799
Let's go.

1320
01:59:45,409 --> 01:59:46,398
- Did you keep the luggage?
- Yes.

1321
01:59:51,815 --> 01:59:54,807
Child, may your pilgrimage
be a success!

1322
02:01:12,429 --> 02:01:16,832
A snake!

1323
02:01:33,717 --> 02:01:36,379
Oh god!

1324
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:42,382
Lord Krishna, save my son!

1325
02:01:45,396 --> 02:01:48,729
Lord Krishna, save my son!

1326
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,771
Listen!

1327
02:02:41,785 --> 02:02:44,777
I saw your lord!

1328
02:02:45,389 --> 02:02:47,789
- What?!
- Yes, I saw with my own eyes.

1329
02:02:48,792 --> 02:02:50,384
- What are you saying?
- Listen!

1330
02:02:51,795 --> 02:02:53,729
After a bath when I was
applying vermilion...

1331
02:02:54,798 --> 02:02:56,800
a huge snake came near our son.

1332
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,394
I screamed out of fear.

1333
02:03:00,404 --> 02:03:02,565
Then I don't know what
happened...

1334
02:03:03,807 --> 02:03:05,798
and Krishna's name came on
my lips.

1335
02:03:06,744 --> 02:03:10,407
- Then what happened?
- Then a peacock attacked the snake.

1336
02:03:10,814 --> 02:03:13,408
He injured him and took him away.

1337
02:03:14,418 --> 02:03:16,818
And my son's life was saved.

1338
02:03:18,822 --> 02:03:20,414
All this while I was living
in darkness.

1339
02:03:21,425 --> 02:03:23,757
And refused to accept His
presence.

1340
02:03:26,363 --> 02:03:27,762
If you can, please forgive me.

1341
02:03:29,767 --> 02:03:33,703
Savitri, why are you asking my
forgiveness?

1342
02:03:35,372 --> 02:03:37,772
Come, ask Him for forgiveness.

1343
02:03:50,788 --> 02:03:52,380
"O my master...

1344
02:03:58,395 --> 02:04:01,796
we have come to You for help"

1345
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:08,795
"We have come to your doors...

1346
02:04:09,406 --> 02:04:13,399
chanting Your name, o Ghanshyam".

1347
02:04:54,384 --> 02:04:59,788
"It's only with your
benevolence...

1348
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:04,724
that I'll be free from my misery".

1349
02:05:12,402 --> 02:05:17,396
"The light of my life...

1350
02:05:18,408 --> 02:05:21,809
will bring happiness in my life".

1351
02:05:29,353 --> 02:05:32,686
"Where You are...

1352
02:05:37,761 --> 02:05:39,353
how can darkness prevail there"?

1353
02:06:26,743 --> 02:06:31,737
"O lord, help me".

1354
02:06:48,765 --> 02:06:53,702
"You have made many devotees
happy...

1355
02:06:54,371 --> 02:06:58,774
resolve my problem also,
o my lord!"

1356
02:07:24,334 --> 02:07:28,737
"After your birth,
Mother Devaki...

1357
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:32,675
was free from all her troubles".

1358
02:07:34,745 --> 02:07:39,739
"You made me a mother but
why did You...

1359
02:07:40,350 --> 02:07:44,343
then take away all my
happiness"?

1360
02:07:45,355 --> 02:07:50,349
"We are in trouble...

1361
02:07:51,361 --> 02:07:55,354
help us, o Girdhari!"

1362
02:08:24,728 --> 02:08:27,322
"Krishna, strange are your
ways!"

1363
02:08:32,335 --> 02:08:36,328
"Glories to You!"

1364
02:08:41,344 --> 02:08:45,747
"Whoever comes in Your refuge...

1365
02:08:46,349 --> 02:08:49,341
is blessed!"

1366
02:09:04,367 --> 02:09:07,768
"Lord, nobody goes...

1367
02:09:08,371 --> 02:09:08,769
empty handed from your doors".

1368
02:09:13,376 --> 02:09:16,368
"You bless all Your devotees...

1369
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:20,781
with the fulfillment of their
wishes".

1370
02:09:22,385 --> 02:09:26,378
"Radha's consort and Meera's
Mohan...

1371
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:30,385
resolve my problems".

1372
02:09:56,419 --> 02:09:59,411
"O Nandlal...

1373
02:10:17,841 --> 02:10:19,433
"o Gopala...

1374
02:10:24,381 --> 02:10:27,373
"o flute singer...

1375
02:10:28,785 --> 02:10:32,721
You are my only succor".

1376
02:10:34,391 --> 02:10:38,384
"I am shrouded in darkness".

1377
02:10:43,733 --> 02:10:47,396
"Now shower Your grace on us".

1378
02:10:48,405 --> 02:10:50,396
"Please cast aside...

1379
02:10:55,412 --> 02:10:57,403
the shadows of sorrow now".

1380
02:11:33,383 --> 02:11:35,783
When You have developed faith
in me for Yourself...

1381
02:11:37,387 --> 02:11:38,376
so please forgive me also.

1382
02:11:38,788 --> 02:11:41,382
We have wandered and prayed at
all Your temples...

1383
02:11:41,791 --> 02:11:43,725
now please pardon us, Lord.

1384
02:11:44,794 --> 02:11:45,783
My only fault is that...

1385
02:11:47,397 --> 02:11:50,798
I considered my house a temple
and my husband my lord?

1386
02:11:51,801 --> 02:11:53,393
My husband is my master.

1387
02:11:53,737 --> 02:11:55,796
But You are the master of
the entire universe.

1388
02:11:57,407 --> 02:11:58,396
I didn't fold my hands to You.

1389
02:11:59,809 --> 02:12:01,800
And for so long never chanted
Your name.

1390
02:12:02,812 --> 02:12:03,801
I resisted You.

1391
02:12:05,415 --> 02:12:09,408
Punish me but don't punish my
son for my sins, Lord.

1392
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:13,821
You have given him life,
but...

1393
02:12:16,426 --> 02:12:17,825
You can breathe life in
stone also.

1394
02:12:18,828 --> 02:12:23,356
Then why don't You give my child
the strength to call out mother?

1395
02:12:23,767 --> 02:12:26,759
A mother is eager to hear her
child's voice.

1396
02:12:27,771 --> 02:12:30,763
Please Lord, for the sake of your
mother, grant this mother her right.

1397
02:12:31,775 --> 02:12:34,767
If not for me or my husband...

1398
02:12:36,379 --> 02:12:37,778
but show Your power for
those...

1399
02:12:39,382 --> 02:12:40,781
who don't believe in You.

1400
02:12:41,785 --> 02:12:42,774
Like I didn't believe in You.

1401
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:48,783
Lord, show your miracle so even
they can believe in You.

1402
02:12:49,793 --> 02:12:51,784
Perhaps our voice may not
reach You...

1403
02:12:52,796 --> 02:12:53,728
or Your doors...

1404
02:12:54,397 --> 02:12:56,797
but the sound of this bell
will surely reach You.

1405
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:00,801
And this will ring until this
child is cured.

1406
02:13:02,405 --> 02:13:03,804
I will continue to ring the
bell...

1407
02:13:04,407 --> 02:13:05,396
until my last breath.

1408
02:16:02,385 --> 02:16:03,784
Move!

1409
02:16:05,788 --> 02:16:06,777
Why are all of you so sad?

1410
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:09,381
Why aren't you all smiling?

1411
02:16:09,792 --> 02:16:11,384
Child, who are you?

1412
02:16:11,794 --> 02:16:14,786
My name is Gopal and I am
a cowherd.

1413
02:16:15,398 --> 02:16:17,389
I was tending to my cows in
the fields.

1414
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:21,793
But on hearing the temple
bells, I came here.

1415
02:16:24,674 --> 02:16:25,732
Why are they lying down here?

1416
02:16:28,344 --> 02:16:29,743
Whose child is this?

1417
02:16:30,747 --> 02:16:32,339
He is so cute.

1418
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:36,341
Child, open your eyes.
You won't?

1419
02:16:36,753 --> 02:16:39,745
Child, say something.
You won't?

1420
02:16:40,356 --> 02:16:42,688
Let me see! Let me see!

1421
02:17:21,397 --> 02:17:22,386
Who's that?

1422
02:18:30,333 --> 02:18:34,326
"Sing glories of Radhe Shyam!"

1423
02:19:19,382 --> 02:19:22,715
"Glories to Govardhan Girdhari!"
