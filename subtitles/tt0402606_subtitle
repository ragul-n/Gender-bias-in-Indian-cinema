1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,538
23.976

2
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:02,335
Brother-in-law...

3
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:06,249
why're you panting like a dog?
Was there a dog chasing you?

4
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:09,328
How'd a dog chase me?
You were at home

5
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,492
I see...

6
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,697
am I a dog...?
I'm your brother-in-law

7
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:18,237
People give their brothers-in-law
so much of respect and love

8
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:22,565
But you just won't encourage me!
- I've stopped encouraging asses

9
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,976
Am I an ass? A moron...?

10
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:30,598
Don't keep insulting me like this!

11
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,304
I come from Hoshiarpur too.
(Hoshiar: Smart)

12
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,801
Listen, you moron from Hoshiarpur.
After what I've done today...

13
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,672
your Hoshiarpur's going to
look extremely silly

14
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:45,709
What did you do...?
Picked the pocket of an old woman?

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,872
That's what your folks taught me.
I gave that up when they were jailed

16
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:55,741
I've made ten rupees!
- Ten rupees? How come?

17
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:59,070
The bus was ahead of me,
and I kept running after it...

18
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:02,734
I kept running after it all the way,
I didn't get into it...

19
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,230
I didn't buy a ticket,
saved 10 rupees and even reached home

20
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:12,764
Why're you wailing...?
- I'm laughing! Not wailing!

21
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:15,054
Can't tell whether you're
laughing or crying

22
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:20,841
Brother-in-law, no matter what you
wear, you're still a miser

23
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,794
You could've saved 300 rupees
instead of 10 rupees!

24
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:29,372
How come...?
- Had you run after an...

25
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:33,203
air-conditioned taxi instead of a bus,
you'd have saved 300 rupees!

26
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:38,989
Why did you slap me?

27
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,194
Why do you keep such ideas
to yourself? Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:46,023
Maybe you're from Hoshiarpur,
but don't act smart with me

29
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:48,729
Else, I'll rip you apart

30
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,977
Get ready to leave.
Got to get to work

31
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:54,098
Let's go!
- Listen... get that too

32
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,344
That bag?

33
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,426
Let's go, brother-in-law.
You haven't changed.

34
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,923
But I'm wearing a coat.
- It's an old one

35
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:06,044
So all right...
- Listen...

36
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,624
I've told you so often not to call out
to me when I'm leaving the house

37
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,996
What could I do,
if not call out to you?

38
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:15,743
Here, eat these peels.
- What peels are they?

39
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,824
Peels of the apples
you had last night

40
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,696
You asked me not to throw them away.
That you'd have them for breakfast

41
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,818
Must you call out to me
to feed me these peels?

42
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:28,856
Whenever you call out to me from
behind, all hell breaks loose

43
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:35,349
That's hell for you!

44
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,299
This is Raj Saxena's
maternal grandmother speaking

45
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,295
Grandma!
- Yes. Is Raj Saxena there?

46
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,670
One minute

47
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:50,125
Here you are. It's your
grandmother from Madras

48
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,456
Because you called out from behind,
grandma has telephoned!

49
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:55,411
You must've told her I'm right here!
- Yes, I don't speak lies

50
00:04:55,412 --> 00:04:58,325
Really? Should I ask my grandma
how old you are?

51
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:00,948
I didn't ask you how old you were
when I married you

52
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,319
Brother-in-law, you can keep
fighting over that all your life

53
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,776
Now take that call! Maybe your grandma
has won the legal suit of 500 million!

54
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,354
You might get some money!
- She'll take away whatever I have...

55
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:14,393
she's not giving me a penny.
But I'm a smart alec too

56
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,807
She won't get her hands on me.
- So what are you going to do?

57
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:21,469
Just watch

58
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:27,880
Raj, looks like you have a cold.
Your voice is cracking up

59
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,582
Mix two spoons of honey in
warm water and drink it up

60
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:38,203
Your voice will be restored.
But I'm in bad shape, my son

61
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,696
It's this legal battle
that involves millions and millions

62
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,316
I've got to pay the lawyer
25,000 rupees

63
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:51,647
This appears to be a wrong number.
- Are you listening...?

64
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:54,061
Who's this...? Hello!

65
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,516
I'm Raj Saxena's grandmother,
Mrs Gunkari calling from Madras

66
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:04,468
But we don't sell anything
of the sort at this place

67
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:11,377
Let it remain off the hook!
Or the old hag will keep calling

68
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:14,416
I've told you a million times
not to call me from behind!

69
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,371
Not to give me grandma's calls!
But you won't listen

70
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:20,119
If you call me from behind
or give me grandma's calls again...

71
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:24,574
I'll give you a divorce!
- Enough! You say it just thrice!

72
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,361
Really...? Very good. Let's go
- Where to...?

73
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:31,274
A marriage

74
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:34,312
The bridegroom and the bride
may now take the sacred vows

75
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,728
Stop it, priest!

76
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,517
The vows will be taken only when
they pay 100,000 rupees as dowry

77
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,430
What are you talking about?
100,000 rupees...?

78
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,801
You didn't tell us earlier.
- I'm telling you now!

79
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:52,629
Unless you pay me 100,000 rupees,
my son won't take another step

80
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:56,583
Please don't do this!
For God's sake!

81
00:06:57,332 --> 00:07:00,870
I'm a very poor man! I don't
have a penny to give you...

82
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:04,533
where will I bring
100,000 rupees from?

83
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:08,320
Please don't do this!
I lay my honour at your feet!

84
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:11,401
Have mercy on me and my daughter!

85
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:14,314
Please let the marriage take place!

86
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:16,396
I won't forget your favour
all my life

87
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:20,559
Mr Digamber, a turban is like
a crown for a man

88
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,137
It ought to remain on your head,
not at someone's feet

89
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:27,343
Open the bag

90
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:30,631
Here's your 300,000 rupees.
- 300,000...?

91
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:34,170
For me?
- Yes, for you

92
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,166
It's the end of your problem.
- How can that be?

93
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:43,161
I don't even know you! So how
can I accept this charity...?

94
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:46,033
No charity, this money
is rightfully yours

95
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,280
Mine...?
- Yes

96
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:52,693
20 years ago, your grandfather
gave me 10,000 rupees on interest

97
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:56,731
So that the money would help in
his grand-daughter's marriage

98
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:59,936
Am I not here at the right time then?
- What?

99
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:05,555
Yes. That 10,000 with interest
has accumulated to 300,000 rupees

100
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,342
300,000...?
This is amazing!

101
00:08:10,343 --> 00:08:13,464
Wonderful!
What an honest man

102
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:17,667
I haven't seen an honest man
like you in all my life!

103
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:22,747
Brother-in-law, how has a rotten thief
suddenly turned honest?

104
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,242
Are you out of your mind? If I become
honest, who'll be dishonest?

105
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,696
So what kind of drama was that?
You've lost 300,000 rupees!

106
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:34,651
It was mere fodder.
- Fodder...? Worth 300,000?

107
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,856
I gave it to a servant. He'll be back
soon. With suckers who have millions

108
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:42,852
Friends, to accept people's monies
and return it after 20 years...

109
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:46,722
with interest, has been
the profession of our family

110
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:49,719
My grandfather had started the trade.
When did he first take the money?

111
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,383
1899.
- In 1899...

112
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,714
he took billions of rupees
from princes and maharajas...

113
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:56,879
and when did he return it?
- 1922

114
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,459
In 1922, he returned the money
with the accruing interest

115
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,039
After that, it was my father
who took over the business

116
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,371
From the English, he took
billions of Dollars...

117
00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:05,786
when...?
- 1932

118
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,450
1932. When did he return it?
- 1947

119
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:11,364
He returned it after the British
left in 1947

120
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:15,818
After him, it was I
who took over the business

121
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:18,648
We can see the pictures of your
father and your grandfather

122
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,271
Why's the third frame empty?
- It's booked in advance. For him

123
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,599
What rubbish?

124
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,305
My father had adopted this chap.
That frame is for him

125
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,343
The day he dies, his picture
will be fixed in it

126
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:35,965
Mr Saxena, I too wish to deposit
half a million rupees with you

127
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,247
I can't accept your money.
- Why not?

128
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:50,117
Not from young men.
The youth ought to work hard

129
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:53,030
If they get into the habit of
living off interest at this age...

130
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:55,653
it'll ruin the nation

131
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:58,358
So I can't ruin the nation
because of you, can I?

132
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,648
But you can come to me
when you're as old as them

133
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,353
Will you be around then...?
- Oh yes

134
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,017
I've put my age on pause mode

135
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:09,389
But you can give it away to me
if you wish to. No...?

136
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,720
Here's your receipt

137
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,718
Good bye

138
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,132
See you again certainly

139
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,380
Bye. See you after 20 years

140
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:19,712
See you

141
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:20,919
Good bye!

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,374
Good bye Mr Saxena. See you.
- See you!

143
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:28,745
See them where?
In the graveyard or hell?

144
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:31,076
Tell me something.
- What?

145
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:34,240
How could you lose the half a million
that boy had brought?

146
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:38,402
You...?
- What do you have for brains?

147
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,272
These guys who were here. How many
years do you think they will live?

148
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:47,018
Maybe five or ten years.
- 20 years from now, can they...

149
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,766
come back to ask for their money?
- No

150
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,596
How old was that boy?
- 20

151
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,761
How old will he be after 20 years?
- 40

152
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:59,339
Won't he come back for his money?
So why must I take it?

153
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,711
Brother-in-law! You have
even beaten Satan!

154
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,874
Amazing! But there will come someone
who's going to chew up your money!

155
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:11,244
No way! No one has the teeth
to chew up my money

156
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:30,434
Who whistled?

157
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:35,762
This one?

158
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:43,046
Yours too?

159
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,043
Also this?

160
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,373
Six bags! My God!

161
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,580
All this luggage is yours?

162
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:56,990
One man with so much luggage?
How much must your family have!

163
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:11,767
Taxi, sir...?

164
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:17,179
C'mon

165
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:48,481
Hey smart-ass!

166
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:03,947
Who's this?

167
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:09,649
One, two, three, four!

168
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,354
Six bags! A new sucker!

169
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:15,351
Brother-in-law!

170
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,683
Brother-in-law!

171
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:20,222
It works out to 90 million,
87,003 rupees

172
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:23,343
How can I forget the 3 rupees?
- Forget it, brother-in-law

173
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:27,381
How can I forget it?
I'll sue you for it

174
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:30,545
Forget it, brother-in-law! Whose
face did you see early this morning?

175
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:33,041
Yours, of course.
- You must, every day

176
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,330
We have a new sucker!
- What will I do with him?

177
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:39,744
Six bags! Full of currency notes!
- Where?

178
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:44,198
Out there! But don't drive him away.
He's a youngster

179
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:47,735
You drove a youngster away earlier.
- With one bag, I'd drive him away

180
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:53,980
With six bags, I'll make him live here!
Prepare to welcome him!

181
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,883
Yours is a fantastic welcome.
- Our good-bye is fantastic too

182
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,338
What does that mean...?
- Nothing. He's nuts

183
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,627
Because I'm his brother-in-law.
- I'll beat the hell out of you

184
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,332
Pleased to meet you

185
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:22,451
Raj K. Saxena.
- Raj K. Saxena

186
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:25,448
Don't imitate me, feller.
My name is Raj K. Saxena

187
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,444
But I'm not imitating you.
My name is Raj K. Saxena too

188
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:33,149
Two Raj K. Saxena's!
What a co-accident!

189
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,350
Move it!

190
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:44,471
Welcome

191
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:49,631
Six suitcases!
A new sucker!

192
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:52,754
Raj... watch how you fall

193
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:58,457
I mean, watch your step, okay?

194
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:03,244
Actually, I do up the
dining table every morning

195
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:07,739
Unless I take a liking to someone,
I can't even swallow a morsel

196
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,361
I have a whole lifetime ahead
to eat and drink

197
00:16:11,362 --> 00:16:16,356
How about talking business first?
- What a sensible boy!

198
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:21,143
Come

199
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:28,219
Keep it here... careful

200
00:16:28,345 --> 00:16:30,133
Wonderful

201
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,256
Open it.
- Of course, I will...

202
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,337
but please shut the doors first.
- Why?

203
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:40,208
It has to do with millions, you see.
Even walls have eyes nowadays

204
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,036
He's so right! Jagirdar...
- Murli!

205
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,908
Whatever! Go and shut
all the doors and windows!

206
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:52,070
Hurry!
- At once

207
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,482
Done...?

208
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:02,185
Open it now.
- Open it!

209
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,347
They're empty!

210
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,011
I'll fill them up with the
currency notes you give me

211
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:12,217
I'll give you currency notes?
- He...? No way! No way!

212
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:15,587
Am I out of my mind to give
you money to take away?

213
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,751
But I'll have to fill it up, sir.
- Why?

214
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:21,374
20 years ago, my grandfather had
sold the land in our village

215
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,746
For 200,000 rupees. And that 200,000
he had deposited with you on interest

216
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:29,242
He was so impressed by you
that he named me after you!

217
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,364
Raj K. Saxena!

218
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:34,943
After 20 years, I've come
to recover the money from you

219
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,274
10 per cent per annum
on 20,00,000...

220
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:42,728
works out to 146 million...
- Step back! Lay off!

221
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:46,307
Who are you? Who's your grandfather?
What name...?

222
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:49,346
Brij Kumar Saxena...
- I don't know any Brij Kumar Saxena!

223
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:52,343
We're from Benaras!
- Which country is that...?

224
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:55,505
No country, it's a city, sir.
On the banks of the Ganges...

225
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:58,670
What's a river?
- Water-bed. He doesn't know the sea

226
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:04,332
This is wonderful, sir! So you don't
know my grandfather Brij Kumar Saxena

227
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,619
No.
- You don't know about Benaras

228
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,659
Never heard of it.
- You don't know the river Ganges

229
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,324
No

230
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:13,530
But you will recognise the
receipt you signed, won't you?

231
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:19,690
Receipt...? Let me see

232
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:23,062
What have you done!
- Swallowed it

233
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,474
His style. He swallows your money
and then the receipt

234
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:29,597
You can't do anything legally,
nor can you send him to jail

235
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,803
It's all in his tummy.
- What?

236
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,926
You came to recover money from me?
Get going!

237
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,339
My money...?
- What money?

238
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,669
Guys came to me to recover
millions of rupees

239
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,916
But I swallowed it all up.
Every penny and dime!

240
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,537
But I will recover the money
my grandfather gave you!

241
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:50,867
I'd even swallow your grandpa,
what's money!

242
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,032
Get going, or I'll collect
a fee for pushing you out

243
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:56,238
This is going to cost you dearly!
- Get lost!

244
00:18:56,695 --> 00:19:02,731
You're driving me out of my mind...
- To hell with you! Get lost!

245
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:16,259
What are you laughing for?
- Because, 15 years ago...

246
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,923
I came to collect from this man
the money my father had given him

247
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,417
He threw me out just as
he drove you out now...

248
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:26,748
and I fell just where
you landed today!

249
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,871
To make life miserable
for him...

250
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,158
I started this betel-leaf shop
right opposite his house

251
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,198
I suggest you start selling
snacks somewhere around

252
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,819
When he hasn't paid me any money,
how're you going to get it?

253
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,732
I don't know whether you have
received your money or not

254
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,897
But I will leave only after I have
collected my grandfather's money

255
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,851
Hold on, hold on,
when you get your money...

256
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,387
get me 27,00,332 rupees, okay?
- I will, all right

257
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,425
How many people does he
have in the family?

258
00:19:57,426 --> 00:20:00,882
They're three and a half
beings in that house

259
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:05,293
Three and a half?
- Raj K. Saxena, his wife...

260
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:09,248
and his moron of a brother-in-law.
- That makes it two and a half

261
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:13,701
He has a daughter too.
- Don't tell me!

262
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:16,364
How's she to look at? Young?
- Young and cute!

263
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,864
Beautiful...?
- Very beautiful

264
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:20,944
So where is she?
- In Goa. She studies

265
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:24,274
Will she take the bait?
- They all take the bait...

266
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:28,979
if you have what it takes!
- They all take the bait...

267
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:34,389
if you have what it takes!

268
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,317
"Come..."

269
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,108
"come to me..."

270
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,522
"you, who appears in my dreams,
come to me"

271
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,811
"Come..."

272
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,725
"come to me..."

273
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:19,010
"you, who appears in my dreams,
come to me"

274
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:25,421
"My heart pines for you..."

275
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:32,623
"how I wait for you"

276
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:23,446
"All night..."

277
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:26,652
"I can't go to sleep"

278
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,564
"Not for a moment..."

279
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:34,102
"can I stop thinking about you"

280
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,515
"Your love..."

281
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:44,010
"is giving me a kick"

282
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:51,043
"O heartless one..."

283
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:54,457
"I pine for you"

284
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,663
"You are the one..."

285
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:02,365
"I wait for"

286
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:03,780
"Come..."

287
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,696
"come to me..."

288
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:09,900
"you, who appears in my dreams,
come to me"

289
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,444
"Why is there..."

290
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,567
"a fragrance in the air?"

291
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:55,687
"The thought of you..."

292
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:59,100
"sends me astray"

293
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:02,597
"I know not..."

294
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:09,049
"what has happened to me"

295
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:15,792
"My heart..."

296
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:18,915
"pines for you"

297
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:23,117
"You are the one..."

298
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:26,573
"I wait for"

299
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,946
"Come..."

300
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:30,652
"come to me..."

301
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:34,191
"you, who appears in my dreams,
come to me"

302
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:41,331
You...

303
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,454
What did you say? What?

304
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:46,326
This is wonderful! You splash
the muck at me and even...?

305
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:50,488
Muck only, right?
We didn't blow you up

306
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:53,485
You've dirtied my clothes!
Instead of saying you're sorry...

307
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:57,191
you're taking off on me?
- Here's 500 rupees

308
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:03,975
There's a laundry. Have your
clothes dry-cleaned, okay?

309
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:10,468
I've seen many like you

310
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,757
Here's 1000 rupees.
- What for?

311
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:20,084
There's a laundry ahead. Have
your clothes dry-cleaned

312
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,829
What's the 1000 rupees for?
- There's a laundry ahead

313
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,118
Have it dry-cleaned.
- What?

314
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,116
Her clothes.
- But they aren't even stained

315
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:34,278
They'll soon be

316
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:40,648
Madcap! Insolent!
Let me go!

317
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,185
I'm not doing it for free, okay?
I've paid her a thousand rupees

318
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:47,473
You don't know who...
- Hey!

319
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,638
You're a girl and you can
still give me 500 rupees

320
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:53,177
You think we guys are broke?
- Looks like you don't know who I am

321
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:57,547
I'm Raj K. Saxena's daughter!
I'll fix you for sure

322
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:05,707
She was the one I came to woo.
How could I offend her?

323
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:19,401
Wherever you go,
you will find only me

324
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,439
But I don't want to be
a tailor, father

325
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,062
I want to become the
greatest dancer in the world

326
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:26,101
But we're a family of tailors!

327
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,348
I want you to be a ladies' tailor,
not a dancer!

328
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,261
That's exactly why I've brought you
to the fashion designing college here

329
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:35,509
Stand straight!
I'll go and see the Principal

330
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:53,658
Fantastic!
What a sight, I say!

331
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,320
From a distance... stay away!
- What stay away?

332
00:27:57,321 --> 00:28:00,650
Don't get close to the mannequin.
Stay away

333
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:03,814
Where will I find the Principal?
- That's me!

334
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:07,643
I'm the Principal of this college
for fashion designing

335
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:11,182
Teach my son the designing
of fashion like this one

336
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:15,635
But the rascal hates
a needle and thread

337
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:18,674
Don't be worried

338
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:21,671
Not to worry. I'll say something
in your son's ear...

339
00:28:21,672 --> 00:28:23,586
he'll find himself stitching
even in his dreams

340
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:28,164
But he's a real scoundrel.
- So am I

341
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:33,117
He's a third-rate chap!
- So am I

342
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:38,362
He's a bloody dog!
- So am I

343
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:43,275
He teases girls, you know.
- I tease them too

344
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:47,145
What?
- In my dreams

345
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:51,391
If I were to really tease them,
I'd get beaten up

346
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:54,138
All right. Stop guffawing away
and wasting my time

347
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,678
Send the boy in quickly.
I'll have an interview with him

348
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,047
She splashed the muck at him.
He looked like a complete fool

349
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:04,420
He's going to think hard before
he messes with us again

350
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:07,833
Think very hard!

351
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:12,745
What happened?

352
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:17,823
You can certainly interview him, sir.
Oh yes

353
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:21,361
But there's a problem.
- What problem?

354
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:25,774
Save your legs from him.
Don't let him get his hands on them

355
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,479
Why? Will he pull my leg
and cause me to fall?

356
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,767
Yes, sir. He brought my
father to such a crash...

357
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,802
he lost all his front teeth!

358
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:44,214
He can't even fix
dentures anymore

359
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:47,669
God! Dangerous chap!
What sort of a boy is he?

360
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,915
Send him in. I'll take care.
- Do please take care, sir

361
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:56,743
Because you're a nice man

362
00:29:57,618 --> 00:30:01,904
Where are you...?
Babu...

363
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:07,233
It's okay, mister.
Babu...

364
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:17,431
God! Here he comes
to pull my leg

365
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:30,792
You're not touching my legs, okay?
- But why have you put them up, sir?

366
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:36,204
If I keep them down, you'll pull my
legs and send me crashing, right?

367
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:40,365
Why on earth would I cause
you to crash, sir?

368
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:44,653
You're not touching my legs!
I know it all!

369
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:48,357
You want to pull my legs
and make me fall!

370
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,688
But a disciple touches the feet
of his teacher. Old tradition

371
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:53,894
I told you not to touch my feet!
Stand where you are!

372
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,682
But my admission, sir...?
- Your admission is done already

373
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,885
Done?
- Yes

374
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:04,049
My hostel room, sir?
- You've got that too

375
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,379
Really? The room number, sir?
- Room number 102

376
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,332
I told you not to touch me!
Go away!

377
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,201
Let's change the board

378
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,401
Get that here

379
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:33,771
Hurry up

380
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:44,053
No...

381
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,495
Kiran, apply some soap
on my back, will you?

382
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:04,740
Hang on. I'm coming

383
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:12,689
The soap's lying down there.
Could you rub some on my back?

384
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,103
Me?

385
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:32,379
I've been asking and asking.
Apply some soap on my back

386
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:41,911
Haven't you had any breakfast?
Rub it a bit harder

387
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,363
Wow! That's something!

388
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:52,485
But why're your tender hands
feeling like iron today, princess?

389
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,354
No princess. I'm Raja

390
00:32:57,355 --> 00:33:01,681
What happened...?
- Kiran! He got into my bathroom!

391
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:04,888
He even rubbed soap on my back!
- The other day...

392
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:08,550
you dirtied my clothes with yours
and you got on her back today?

393
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,922
Believe me, I don't even know how
I've landed in the girls' hostel

394
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:16,418
The Principal will give you
the answer

395
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,540
Let's go!

396
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,081
At least hear me out, sir...
- Shut up!

397
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,038
How did you get into
the girls' hostel?

398
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,411
I went to the boys' hostel,
not the girls' hostel, sir

399
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:26,908
So you found the girls there?
- Please believe me, sir...

400
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:30,404
it was the boys' hostel I went to.
- I went to the boys' hostel too...

401
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:33,401
but I never found a girl there!
But you find them!

402
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:36,064
It's a matter of one's destiny, sir.
- Shut up!

403
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:38,396
Tell me the truth.
What did you do there?

404
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:41,641
Sir, I took off my clothes
and stood under the shower

405
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:44,764
I then heard this girl's voice.
"My soap has fallen down..."

406
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:49,178
"give that soap to me, please"
- Liar! When did I say that?

407
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:54,214
One moment... what happened then?
- I gave her the soap. And she said...

408
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:59,000
rub the soap on my back, please.
- Really?

409
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,705
When did I say all that?
- Quiet, you stay quiet

410
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,577
I know, girls at this age say
things like that. They sure do

411
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,365
And what happened afterwards?
- I started rubbing soap on her back

412
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:12,820
But sir...
- You girls go away. Go on

413
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:17,357
It's a scene for adults.
Not kids

414
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,894
Go on. I will punish him.
I sure will. Go on. Go

415
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,511
They've gone away!
So tell me... what happened then?

416
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,216
She said, "Rub the soap on my back".
- And you did?

417
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,211
Yes, sir. I started rubbing it
on her back

418
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:42,664
Slowly...

419
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:47,286
and then...

420
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:52,031
Wow!

421
00:34:56,943 --> 00:35:01,312
He's going away!

422
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:03,810
The soap's being
rubbed on her back

423
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:06,431
Her body's on fire.
- Sir!

424
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:10,845
You let him off without a punishment?
- I gave him a warning

425
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:15,340
Just a warning...?
- That's my style

426
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:17,754
Before punishing someone,
I warn him first

427
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:20,668
Then comes the second warning
and the third

428
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:24,249
Must you wait till the third warning?
- Till I suffer a personal loss...

429
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,827
I keep giving them eighth, ninth
and tenth warnings

430
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:36,653
I'm going to teach him a lesson!
- This isn't the time for lessons

431
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:39,774
We've got to attend the rehearsal.
Let's go

432
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,981
You bastard!

433
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:43,021
My cheque book is missing
from 3 months...

434
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:45,310
and money's being siphoned off
from my account. Where's it all going?

435
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,599
It's difficult to trace
a missing cheque-book!

436
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:51,304
I gave you a letter to stop payment
of the cheques. How about that?

437
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:54,301
That one was snatched away too.
So was the cheque book!

438
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:57,548
Snatched it away? Who did?
- Your daughter!

439
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,544
My daughter...?
- Yes, she has taken after you!

440
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,411
I now understand where hundreds of
thousands are going every month

441
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:11,743
My daughter's been forging my signature
and transferring the money there

442
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:15,529
I'll go and close that account
right now. Come on

443
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,693
You slapped me for no reason.
- I'll give you another slap too

444
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:20,357
Listen...
- What?

445
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,439
Not me! It's her

446
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,352
Whenever I'm going out,
this cuckoo sings from behind me

447
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,683
If my sister's a cuckoo,
what am I?

448
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,264
Charcoal!
What is it...?

449
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:34,635
Didn't you ask me to give you
these biscuits crumbs for breakfast?

450
00:36:34,636 --> 00:36:38,299
How could you forget?
- Never mind, I say

451
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,336
Since you called from behind,
I'll surely face some trouble

452
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,334
The telephone bell!

453
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:48,664
God! Save me!

454
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:52,743
This is your grandmother here, son

455
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,782
Damn it! Grandma!
Didn't I tell you...?

456
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:57,320
What is it?

457
00:36:57,321 --> 00:37:00,651
The last hearing in the court
is coming up

458
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,858
I'm surely going to win this case
involving millions and millions

459
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:08,727
It's our property. We will
certainly have it back

460
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,390
Win or lose,
why must I care?

461
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:15,762
Didn't I tell you? I've got to pay
the lawyer his last installment

462
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:19,340
I need only 70,000 rupees.
That's all

463
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:23,254
"All the lines in this route
are busy. So please hang up..."

464
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:25,751
"and don't call this number again"

465
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,082
"The lines are flooded with water.
If you call..."

466
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:32,162
"you could face a deluge.
Please hang up and don't call again"

467
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:34,951
"Buy a mobile phone,
but don't call this number"

468
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,073
"Else, you will have to
face hardships"

469
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:40,278
Who are you?
- I'm the message taking machine

470
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,901
Message? What rubbish!

471
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:45,439
That's the message box I am.
- What rubbish!

472
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,394
Don't call this number again

473
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,723
Three women, I'm really fed up of.
Of the grandma who keeps harassing me

474
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:56,970
Of my wife, who's
always chewing my rains

475
00:37:56,971 --> 00:38:02,008
And my daughter, who keeps
blowing up my money

476
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,661
You...? Here?
- To sign the contract of love

477
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:17,407
What does that mean?
- If you could fix this flower...

478
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:21,738
in your hair, I'll think you
have forgiven me

479
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,776
I will forgive you.
But I have a condition

480
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:27,356
What?

481
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:30,562
You will go out,
close your eyes...

482
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,389
walk fourteen steps to me
and put the flower in my hair

483
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:42,175
Do you agree?
- I agree

484
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:49,334
So close your eyes.
- I have

485
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:51,415
Now start walking

486
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,039
More

487
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,411
More

488
00:38:55,412 --> 00:38:58,408
More

489
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:03,403
Hey! Why have you stopped?
Keep walking

490
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:08,732
Come on... come, closer

491
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:14,103
Come on... keep walking

492
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:21,385
Now bow a little
and plant the flower in my hair

493
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:23,383
One moment!

494
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:29,795
Before you plant the flower,
won't you flatter your darling?

495
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:59,431
Nice partner you have.
Dance with her, go ahead

496
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:03,594
Remember, at the Emami fashion show,
I'll be the one who dances with Kiran

497
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:07,131
How about a bet?
- Sure

498
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:09,462
If I indeed dance with Kiran...

499
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,709
you will blacken your face and go
around the college 10 times

500
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,748
And what if you lose? Speak up.
- I'll take ten rounds

501
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:21,784
That's Bobby Topi's promise

502
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:30,775
Kiran, call for you.
- For me?

503
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:34,687
Kiran, my child.
This is your daddy speaking

504
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:39,682
I'm in a bad way

505
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:45,718
When one is hit by losses,
he sheds tears, my child

506
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,005
The Income Tax department
has raided our house

507
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:52,461
They've seized all documents
of our undeclared income

508
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:55,624
The Income Tax Commissioner has
taken away all the money

509
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,830
What are you talking about?
- It's true

510
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:01,577
Our house, our cars and everything we
have, is soon going to be auctioned

511
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,448
Save me from that Income Tax
officer, my child

512
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:08,153
But how can I save you, daddy?

513
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:11,108
This Income Tax officer who
has raided our house...

514
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,397
has a son who has just
joined your college

515
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,937
Just joined the college?
What's his name?

516
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:20,267
He's your father's namesake.
His name is Raj K. Saxena too

517
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,931
What do you want me to do?
- For my sake, lure him in

518
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:27,676
If the son falls in your clutches,
the father will fall in my hands

519
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:33,963
But dad...
- No discussions, my child

520
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:40,872
Thank you, my child

521
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:52,360
Has she come?
- She's coming

522
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:09,426
So suddenly...?
- My heart, you see

523
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:12,047
It can take a turn anywhere
and anytime

524
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:15,502
Accept this flower.
And give me your heart

525
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:17,792
I'll accept the flower and
give you my heart too

526
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:20,165
But I have a condition.
- What?

527
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:23,662
Close your eyes,
walk 14 steps to me...

528
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,658
pin the flower on my t-shirt,
and then... give me a kiss

529
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:34,693
All right, I agree

530
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:45,431
One moment

531
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:51,134
Won't you say something
before you pin the flower?

532
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:03,746
Wow! This is fun!

533
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,368
I have it made!

534
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,407
What's all this, Raj?
- We're square now. And here I go

535
00:43:14,444 --> 00:43:17,775
Raj, I did make fun of you
and crack a joke at your expense

536
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:24,059
But I really love you today

537
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:28,013
Really?
- Really

538
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:32,259
You're the one I will dance with
at the Emami Golden Jubilee Night

539
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,422
"The nymph..."

540
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:38,545
"was venomous"

541
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:46,205
"I obviously kept my distance"

542
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:54,197
"She was called the spicy one"

543
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:37,819
"Red hot..."

544
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,851
"red hot, spicy..."

545
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:51,388
"in a moment,
it was all devoured"

546
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:55,843
"The parrot had bitten
on the chilli"

547
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:03,793
"Red hot, spicy..."

548
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:06,707
"in a moment,
it was all devoured"

549
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:11,578
"The parrot had bitten
on the chilli"

550
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:50,329
"I was crazy..."

551
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,661
"so was she"

552
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:57,532
"Somehow, our gaze met"

553
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,651
"I'm not in my senses..."

554
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:05,314
"I can't be blamed"

555
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:07,770
"I agree..."

556
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,643
"I've lost my heart"

557
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:14,223
"The state I've been
reduced to"

558
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:30,249
"I used to wield all the magic.
And yet..."

559
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,286
"I used to wield all the magic.
And yet..."

560
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:36,450
"he cast a spell on me"

561
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:40,821
"The parrot had bitten
on the chilli"

562
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:42,924
"Don't even ask me
what this is all about"

563
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:45,339
"He's here with me"

564
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,502
"In my hand is his hand
for good"

565
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:55,329
"Beautiful"

566
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,034
"My love"

567
00:47:58,035 --> 00:48:00,657
"These charms..."

568
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,363
"I'm bowled over by"

569
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:07,527
"I'm in love with her"

570
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:23,177
"Ever since I held her
to my lips..."

571
00:48:23,718 --> 00:48:26,340
"Ever since I held her
to my lips..."

572
00:48:26,341 --> 00:48:29,087
"hers is the colour
I've blended with"

573
00:48:29,088 --> 00:48:33,625
"The parrot bit at the chilli"

574
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,409
"Red hot and spicy..."

575
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,322
"in a moment it
was all devoured"

576
00:48:44,323 --> 00:48:48,901
"The parrot bit at the chilli"

577
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:13,708
Hey Bobby! What farce is this?
- Farce?

578
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,374
I had a bet that you'd dance
only with me

579
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,787
But you danced with Raj
and I lost the bet

580
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:23,742
That's what I'm paying for!

581
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,946
Raj! I'm not sparing you!

582
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:28,652
Who the hell are you, punk?

583
00:49:28,653 --> 00:49:30,775
My daughter is being
rude with me!

584
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:33,148
She means something
else in Gujarati

585
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:36,520
But where does she know Gujarati?
- Doesn't she?

586
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,352
Who's me?

587
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,681
It's me... your father,
your daddy

588
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:43,845
Daddy, you...? At this hour?

589
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:47,219
I'm visiting an acquaintance.
I saw his phone lying around...

590
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:52,753
so I quietly made a call to Goa

591
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:55,335
What's too much?
This is my true character

592
00:49:55,336 --> 00:49:59,040
What character! A shame...
on me, really

593
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,869
Dad, I've done just as
you told me to

594
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,407
What had I told you?
- Why don't you understand?

595
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:09,404
About wooing the boy, taking him
around, showing him places...

596
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:12,942
making things happen...
I've done it all, dad!

597
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:16,688
What boy and things? Are you crazy?
When did I say that to you?

598
00:50:17,105 --> 00:50:20,185
Two days ago, you said it to me!
- Are you mad?

599
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:22,973
I've been looking for a phone
for two days...

600
00:50:22,974 --> 00:50:24,721
now I found one, and I score!

601
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:28,051
Now wait! You mean, it wasn't you
who called two days ago?

602
00:50:28,052 --> 00:50:31,799
Not at all!

603
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,939
Kiran...

604
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,059
open your eyes

605
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:15,490
Get lost!
I'm not talking to you

606
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:18,905
You forged my signatures
and transferred all my money...

607
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,901
to your bank account in Goa.
- Daughters are meant to blow up money

608
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:27,104
Why would you earn money
if we don't blow it up?

609
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:32,348
But you can't blow up a treasure.
It was for your wedding...

610
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,970
Dowry, wedding expenses...
no tension at all

611
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:39,466
You mean you've organised your wedding?
- Yes

612
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:42,005
And a bridegroom, too.
- A bridegroom, too!

613
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:45,253
A bridegroom, who would not
take a cent in dowry

614
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:48,998
Is it?
- And he'll serve you all your life

615
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:51,412
What kind of a bridegroom is that?
Bring him over sometime

616
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,786
Sometimes? Right now, I say.
Hold your heart

617
00:54:55,534 --> 00:54:58,614
And close your eyes.
He's so damn handsome

618
00:54:58,615 --> 00:55:01,028
Really? Call him

619
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:04,609
Come on, Mr Bridegroom.
- Come on

620
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:07,105
Show up.
- Won't you let me say it?

621
00:55:07,106 --> 00:55:10,560
I've said it already

622
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,932
Come on, Mr Bridegroom

623
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:16,346
Give him a hug

624
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,093
Wow! He's so cold

625
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:22,340
Obviously! He comes for free.
- Shut up

626
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:24,921
You'll feel the heat in no time.
- No way

627
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,543
Enough brother-in-law. You're through.
- No way

628
00:55:27,544 --> 00:55:29,916
It was tough finding a son-in-law.
- I say, enough

629
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:34,994
Let go!
- Let it be

630
00:55:34,995 --> 00:55:38,200
What the...? Don't go away, son.
- He is here to stay

631
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:45,734
You can open your eyes now

632
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,981
You?

633
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:51,312
Son-in-law, my foot!
He can't be my bloody servant

634
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:57,014
Not even my driver or cook!

635
00:55:57,015 --> 00:55:59,053
My shoe!
Where did he go?

636
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:02,966
He wants to use my daughter
to reach my safe. Where is he?

637
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:05,796
Father-in-law! Your wildest fear
is going to come true

638
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,961
The father-in-law will cry and the
son-in-law will have the last laugh

639
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:09,376
Damn you!

640
00:56:09,377 --> 00:56:12,373
The father-in-law will cry and the
son-in-law will have the last laugh

641
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:15,787
Freeloader! If you return, I'll have
you trampled under military shoes

642
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,033
If not, I'm no Raj Saxena!
- Dad, what's this madness?

643
00:56:19,034 --> 00:56:22,363
I'm in love with him.
- Shame on you. He's just not worthy

644
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:25,653
He loves my money, not you.
If he touches my money...

645
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:28,857
I'll wring his neck.
- Do what you want, dad

646
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:31,770
But I'll marry only him.
- Not even in your wildest dreams

647
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,934
If you do, I'll come into your dream
and thwart the wedding

648
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:37,306
Now look, don't pick my brains.
Go inside

649
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:41,011
Get in, I beg of you

650
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:44,341
What a girl!
- Let's go to Dhaniram...

651
00:56:44,342 --> 00:56:47,005
and fix the wedding

652
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:50,503
You'd better give it another thought.
- I always think before I decide...

653
00:56:50,919 --> 00:56:55,747
Listen...
- There! The spanner in the works

654
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,494
I wanted to tell you that I'll never
call out to you when you're going out

655
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,447
Now that you've done it,
the damage is as good as done

656
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:08,943
There!
- Pick it up

657
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:11,981
Who?

658
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:14,311
I'm grandma from Madras

659
00:57:14,312 --> 00:57:17,392
Grandma from Madras!
A serious matter, is it?

660
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:20,556
It's serious, she says.
- No way! She wants money. Cut her off

661
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:26,132
Yes, he is in. Talk.
- May you be ruined

662
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:29,963
Mrs Gunkari here. Your grandma

663
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:33,751
He's not in. I'm his dear wife

664
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:38,579
I was ruined the day
I married your grandson

665
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:44,491
He's fallen deep in debt. He's gone to
the Himalayas to get it off his back

666
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:49,568
I think he's renouncing the world.
I fear, he might freeze in the cold

667
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:52,357
Even if he returns,
he'll melt down and flow away

668
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:57,310
Don't call here again.
I'll hang up. Hail India

669
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,850
Sonofagun, get lost!

670
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:02,554
I think your grandson Raj Saxena
didn't speak to you

671
00:58:02,555 --> 00:58:06,802
He used to send me money
to fight the case

672
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:13,003
Finally he has given up

673
00:58:13,003 --> 00:58:18,207
Like me. I'm sick and tired
of pursuing this case

674
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,327
He has even stopped talking to me

675
00:58:25,574 --> 00:58:30,360
Bloody scrooge

676
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:34,648
He changes his voice
and tries to fool me

677
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:44,222
Lawyer, he doesn't know that the case
worth 500 million has come in my favour

678
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:50,132
My time is up

679
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,504
Lawyer...
- Yes?

680
00:58:52,505 --> 00:58:57,792
You must deliver the 500 million
to my grandson Saxena

681
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:03,661
And tell him not
to be angry with me

682
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:07,865
Please sign this will

683
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:12,068
Sign here

684
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:16,482
One here

685
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:21,976
This is the limit. At least
your grandson should've spoken to you

686
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,220
Mrs Gunkari, I think...

687
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:10,011
What's wrong with brother-in-law?

688
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:11,384
Brother-in-law!

689
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:13,799
What the hell...?
- Why are you hiding like a dog?

690
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,462
Don't talk about dogs!
- Dogs aren't so wild

691
01:00:16,463 --> 01:00:20,375
My car ran over a dog.
- Your car?

692
01:00:20,376 --> 01:00:23,622
How can a man's car, who runs
behind buses, run over a dog?

693
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:26,869
It's the brakeless car that
your sister brought in dowry

694
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:30,406
I see. But why are you worried?

695
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:33,655
It was just another dog, right?
- Not just another dog

696
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:37,900
It was the minister's dog.
- The minister's dog?

697
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:42,229
Good Lord! It's life is
more precious than a human's

698
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:45,808
Don't scare me.
- It's true. You've got to face it

699
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,348
Well!

700
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:50,345
I was wondering
why the cops called here

701
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:53,842
They've already called?
- Yes. I told them your whereabouts

702
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:57,630
Look at her!
- They must've asked her. So what?

703
01:00:57,631 --> 01:01:00,335
Damn!
- The cops will be here...

704
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:02,333
Don't say it!
- Along with a lawyer

705
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:05,538
May you be ruined.
- There! The cops. I'll check...

706
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:09,243
Wait, you are jinxed. I'll check.
- Jinxed? It should be the cops

707
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:15,361
Police!
- I told you. Welcome

708
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:17,193
Here's my brother-in-law.
- What are you upto?

709
01:01:17,194 --> 01:01:19,691
I'm a patriot.
I can't violate the law

710
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:23,438
He is the one.
- We're here...

711
01:01:24,437 --> 01:01:26,559
someone has died.
- Died?

712
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,848
You will be charged for murder.
You are a goner

713
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:34,051
Dead...? Really?

714
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:36,340
Yes. She is dead.
- A female?

715
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:40,004
Strange. Who knows better
than you do?

716
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:43,293
So that's the matter.
- Right. It's very serious

717
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:46,749
And it has to be solved right away,
before we goof up

718
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,411
To err is human.
- So he erred

719
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:54,031
You are prone to err, too.
- Of course, I'm human too

720
01:01:54,032 --> 01:01:56,487
That's exactly the problem. Which is
why we're investigating thoroughly

721
01:01:56,488 --> 01:01:59,694
But the problem is that we know
the area where Raj K Saxena lives...

722
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:06,728
however, we don't know
his exact address

723
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:12,763
So it is imperative that we know
who this Raj K Saxena really is

724
01:02:13,304 --> 01:02:16,552
There are lots of Raj K Saxenas
apart from me in the neighbourhood

725
01:02:17,092 --> 01:02:20,839
Really?
- The one over there is a scoundrel

726
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,084
He drives so recklessly,
his car is brakeless

727
01:02:24,085 --> 01:02:28,289
We've nothing to do with that.
We have the court's order

728
01:02:28,997 --> 01:02:32,868
So go to the betel-leaf vendor there.
Hurry up, else you'll miss him

729
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:34,990
All right

730
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:40,860
Go on... go!
- Gone

731
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:43,815
Who is Mr Raj?

732
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:45,605
I'm Raj

733
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:49,101
Full name?
- Raj K Saxena

734
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:53,138
Father's name?
- Balraj K Saxena

735
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:56,010
Where's block 17?

736
01:02:56,011 --> 01:03:00,799
Damn it! You're standing right there

737
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,835
Block 17 starts here
and ends there...

738
01:03:06,377 --> 01:03:07,957
There? I see

739
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:11,580
And where do you stay, sir?
- This is where I stay

740
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,325
The name is right

741
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:17,947
Father's name is right, too

742
01:03:17,948 --> 01:03:21,110
Looks decent, too

743
01:03:21,111 --> 01:03:25,023
Block 17... right

744
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:27,063
Mr Raj, there's bad news for you

745
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:29,394
There's good news, too

746
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:32,973
The good news is that you've
become a millionaire overnight

747
01:03:32,974 --> 01:03:37,303
And the bad news is that
your grandma is dead

748
01:03:37,304 --> 01:03:41,508
Raj, your grandma is dead.
- But she died 10 years ago

749
01:03:42,923 --> 01:03:47,335
I'm acting. You'd better act, too,
and you will become a millionaire

750
01:03:47,336 --> 01:03:50,040
My grandma is dead! Lord

751
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:54,204
Oh, what have you done, Lord?
What am I to do now?

752
01:03:55,036 --> 01:03:57,948
Grandma, I'm coming!

753
01:03:57,949 --> 01:04:01,362
Look, don't be upset.
Please listen to me

754
01:04:01,363 --> 01:04:07,814
Don't weep. Your grandma willed
a demand draft of 500 million to you

755
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,349
500 million? Mine?
- Yes

756
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,556
500 million!
- I have with me her belongings

757
01:04:17,929 --> 01:04:20,718
Spectacles, a shawl,
a walking stick and some clothes

758
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:23,923
I'll give it to you
the next time I come. Goodbye

759
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:31,500
You made me cry for no reason.
- No reason? You got 500 million...

760
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:34,329
for shedding a few drops of tears.
- What do you mean?

761
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:38,535
It is that Raj K Saxena's
grandma who died

762
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:44,111
The advantage of bearing the same name
fetched you 500 million

763
01:04:44,112 --> 01:04:46,317
Which means...

764
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:49,648
if God snatches something away,
He offers you something too

765
01:04:50,314 --> 01:04:55,850
I've become a millionaire!

766
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,804
Brother-in-law, by jogging it out,
we've saved 200 bucks till here

767
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:03,426
225 bucks, to be exact

768
01:05:03,427 --> 01:05:06,297
It's 300 now

769
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:09,462
300? It's 600.
- How come 600?

770
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:12,748
300 yours and 300 mine

771
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:15,830
Why should both of us pay when
we're travelling in the same taxi?

772
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:20,243
As for me, I won't be
travelling with a jerk like you

773
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,988
Both of us will travel
in different taxis

774
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:28,443
I'm not travelling with
a scrooge like you either

775
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:33,522
Please sit in the taxi,
I'll drop you

776
01:05:33,979 --> 01:05:37,766
For free?
- Taxi drivers are very generous

777
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:42,719
No way. It's a matter of the bill,
which I'll be paid for

778
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:47,508
Bill? Who's going to foot the bill?
- The mental asylum

779
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:50,585
The mental asylum!

780
01:05:50,586 --> 01:05:56,664
Right. The chaps there told me that
if I fetch them lunatics...

781
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:02,201
they will pay me the taxi fare

782
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:08,361
So you see, I'll get paid

783
01:06:13,563 --> 01:06:15,062
Chicken...
- Murli!

784
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:17,352
Hardly matters

785
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,806
Are you watching what I'm watching?
- Yes, brother-in-law

786
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:25,386
Which means, you guys are not mad

787
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,882
Shut him up, will you?
- We aren't mad

788
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,296
But that boy will
surely drive us mad

789
01:06:31,297 --> 01:06:33,959
I know the boy

790
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,747
His grandma died, left behind millions
of rupees for him. He's having a ball

791
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:42,950
Look

792
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:46,323
He's distributing notes
of 500 denomination

793
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:51,026
You wish you were a beggar, right?

794
01:06:51,027 --> 01:06:54,399
Hey! Look at a big boy cry

795
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:57,020
For 500 bucks?

796
01:06:57,021 --> 01:07:00,641
Not for the money, Chicken...
- Murli! Get the name right

797
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,471
It's one and the same thing.
It reminds me of my grandma

798
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:08,758
His grandmother died and left
him millions. Mine only abuses me...

799
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:12,338
and keeps asking me for money.
- Tell you something...

800
01:07:12,339 --> 01:07:15,377
she hasn't called for days now

801
01:07:15,378 --> 01:07:18,540
Must she call me? Every time
your jinxed sister nags me...

802
01:07:18,957 --> 01:07:22,411
my grandma calls up.
- I'm surprised

803
01:07:22,412 --> 01:07:25,490
What about?
- This guy is going to make you...

804
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:28,529
face the music someday

805
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,777
"Hear me, father-in-law"

806
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:36,689
"I'm allergic to wealth"

807
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:40,517
"Let me meet my beloved"

808
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:44,141
"For me..."

809
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:49,801
"my bride is my dowry"

810
01:07:55,461 --> 01:07:58,792
"Get us married, father-in-law"

811
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,621
"The girl is willing...
heed my appeal"

812
01:08:25,307 --> 01:08:28,679
"Give the bride away,
you will be blessed"

813
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:32,424
"Don't take me for a fraud"

814
01:08:32,883 --> 01:08:35,922
"Don't take him for a fraud"

815
01:08:40,126 --> 01:08:43,413
"Get us married, father-in-law"

816
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:47,576
"The girl is willing...
heed my appeal"

817
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:18,837
"I'm richer than you"

818
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:22,625
"So tell me, father-in-law,
what do you think?"

819
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:26,620
"Tell me"

820
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,035
"Neither silver nor gold,
neither bungalow nor car..."

821
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,697
"I want my bride to come
only wearing a dress"

822
01:09:39,858 --> 01:09:43,352
"Don't take me for
a broke tailor"

823
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:46,642
"The girl is willing...
heed my appeal"

824
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:50,513
"The girl is willing...
heed his appeal"

825
01:10:15,363 --> 01:10:18,944
"How dare you think of
becoming my son-in-law"

826
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:23,272
"Why don't you go and
look into the mirror?"

827
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:29,891
"I know your types, punk"

828
01:10:30,348 --> 01:10:33,637
"I'm not giving you my girl"

829
01:10:39,965 --> 01:10:43,334
"You are not worthy
of being even my cook"

830
01:10:43,335 --> 01:10:46,749
"This wedding is not happening
without my consent"

831
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,578
"This wedding is not happening
without his consent"

832
01:10:58,113 --> 01:11:01,734
"Daddy, don't break our hearts"

833
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:05,479
"You too, my child?"

834
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,936
"Daddy, don't break our hearts"

835
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:12,932
"Happily give your consent
to this relationship"

836
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:19,966
"When the boy and the girl
are willing..."

837
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,962
"father-in-law,
the priest has no choice"

838
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:33,409
"I'm his princess,
he's my Prince Charming..."

839
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,783
"Don't take him for
a fraud son-in-law"

840
01:11:44,816 --> 01:11:48,353
"Get us married, father-in-law"

841
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:52,225
"The girl is willing...
heed my appeal"

842
01:11:59,343 --> 01:12:02,756
"Listen to me, father-in-law,
listen..."

843
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:06,335
"get us married.
Let's become relatives"

844
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:09,583
"That's a dream
you will see for ever"

845
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:13,495
"I've brought the priest over.
- I'll throw him out"

846
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,743
"I've brought the mullah over.
- I'll box him"

847
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,489
"Father is here...
- I've called the police over"

848
01:12:20,946 --> 01:12:24,358
"I'll go on a hunger strike!
- I won't allow you"

849
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:27,648
"I'll take my bride away!
- I'll send you to jail"

850
01:12:28,064 --> 01:12:31,477
"Don't get worked up.
- Don't work up this matter"

851
01:12:31,478 --> 01:12:34,849
"Give your consent, please.
- I'm a tough nut to crack"

852
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:38,428
"Tough, eh?
What are you saying?"

853
01:12:38,429 --> 01:12:41,009
"Tough, really?
Then hear this..."

854
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,007
"from a madcap"

855
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:47,170
"Give me your daughter, father-in-law.
I'll make you a grandfather"

856
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:50,041
"What did you say?
No way"

857
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:53,205
"Never, never"

858
01:12:53,664 --> 01:12:59,241
"I will, I will"

859
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:04,027
"Yes, yes"

860
01:13:04,028 --> 01:13:05,526
"No"

861
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:10,480
"No"

862
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:43,864
Trembling?

863
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:48,316
You're trembling

864
01:13:48,317 --> 01:13:51,772
Even a tiger trembles
before Sher Aflatoon

865
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:56,308
Death is terrible

866
01:13:56,309 --> 01:13:58,057
Spare me!

867
01:13:58,057 --> 01:14:01,054
Brother...

868
01:14:01,054 --> 01:14:03,759
Salaam. We have found out

869
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,923
He's a young boy. Raj K Saxena

870
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:09,878
He's got all of 500 million

871
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,960
Keep talking.
You are my brothers. Go on

872
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:16,080
Brother, he is from Benaras

873
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:19,619
Stays in Vidya Nagar.
Blows up money like water

874
01:14:20,077 --> 01:14:24,322
Really

875
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:27,152
500 million

876
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:30,066
I have a right over 250 million

877
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:35,229
Tell him to give me my 250 million
and live in peace

878
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:40,598
If he doesn't agree,
show him this bloodstained coat

879
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:45,550
I will.
- He will agree

880
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,882
Well... what's your name...?
- Nothing

881
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:51,004
You forgot my sister's name? Rekha!
- Forget it

882
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:55,041
Call our daughter.
The suitor's family is here to see her

883
01:14:55,042 --> 01:14:56,415
Greetings

884
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:58,913
Good Lord! Is he the suitor?
- Good...

885
01:14:58,914 --> 01:15:03,866
He's not the suitor.
There he is

886
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:06,322
Is he, really?
- Or, is he a parrot?

887
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:09,694
Shut up. Call her here.
They've come to see her

888
01:15:10,068 --> 01:15:12,815
She flew to Dubai yesterday

889
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:16,353
What? Your daughter goes to Dubai
before her wedding?

890
01:15:16,354 --> 01:15:20,309
That too all alone?
- Daddy! The girl is flawed

891
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,721
Dubai? That too, all by herself?

892
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:26,135
We don't want this alliance.
- Let's go

893
01:15:26,136 --> 01:15:29,007
We don't want an alliance with such
a family. I don't want to hear a thing

894
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:31,297
Listen to me...
- We don't want this alliance

895
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:33,502
Listen...

896
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,001
What a shame!

897
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:37,998
My daughter goes to Dubai
and I don't even know!

898
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:41,328
Only if you spare time from inventing
formulas to scrimp and save

899
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,992
You keep making entries
of dead old men

900
01:15:43,993 --> 01:15:47,322
You never care for your family.
- But you should've told me...

901
01:15:47,323 --> 01:15:50,319
that my daughter flew to Dubai.
- She has gone on a world tour

902
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,316
World tour? You should've said that
to the suitor's family

903
01:15:53,317 --> 01:15:55,814
Why did you say Dubai?
- Dubai is the first halt

904
01:15:55,815 --> 01:15:58,311
You should've said so

905
01:15:58,312 --> 01:16:01,642
Looks like another suitor. I'll check.
- Hang on. Follow me

906
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:09,342
Greetings.
- Old nuisance, brother-in-law

907
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,630
But I didn't run over anyone today.
What is it?

908
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:16,294
Mr Raj K Saxena is not at home

909
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:20,123
I have his belongings with him.
- Don't even mention him

910
01:16:20,124 --> 01:16:22,537
Why?
- He ran away with his daughter

911
01:16:22,538 --> 01:16:25,617
She's your niece, too.
Why must you tell outsiders?

912
01:16:25,618 --> 01:16:28,782
Outsiders? But I'm inside my house.
- You are shameless

913
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:31,278
Take it easy, please

914
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,275
If you could keep
these things of his...

915
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:36,939
Dump them in a trash bin! Not here

916
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,435
Make him see reasons. Besides,
it's only a few things;...

917
01:16:40,436 --> 01:16:44,266
Walking stick, spectacles, shawl,
grandma's picture... that's all

918
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:48,011
Brother-in-law, you mustn't insult
elders' pictures. Keep it

919
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:51,176
Why don't you keep it?
- Gosh! Give it to me, mister

920
01:16:54,839 --> 01:16:59,251
Hats off to the grandma who left
behind 500 million for her grandson

921
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,287
Let me take her blessings

922
01:17:03,288 --> 01:17:06,284
My luck might just shine

923
01:17:06,285 --> 01:17:10,490
This is what you call granny! And you!
You never bother about your granny

924
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:14,318
At least take a look.
Your luck might shine too

925
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:16,399
I don't want...

926
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,979
Hey! That's my granny!

927
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,519
What?
- She's my granny

928
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,434
Your granny?
- Yes, I swear by you

929
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:27,223
Don't swear by me. I'm not a scrooge.
- She's my granny!

930
01:17:27,598 --> 01:17:31,552
Which means, your granny is dead.
- No, I'm dead

931
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:35,839
That fraud Raj K Saxena flew away
with my daughter and my 500 million

932
01:17:36,422 --> 01:17:39,711
Somebody catch him.
Somebody call the police

933
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:44,164
Somebody call the army!
My 500 million!

934
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:46,286
He!

935
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:49,784
You gave my 500 million
to the wrong guy

936
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,697
You will break it.
- To hell with it!

937
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:57,067
Give me back my 500 million!

938
01:17:57,068 --> 01:18:00,231
If this is your granny, and if your
money has gone to the wrong guy...

939
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:04,102
you alone are responsible for it.
- How am I responsible?

940
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:08,306
How strange! I had come to you.
You said you are not Raj K Saxena

941
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:11,471
You told me he lives there.
You told me, didn't you?

942
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,967
Shut up! It appeared as if you had
come to arrest me

943
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,838
We lawyers have a typical style.
- Damn the style

944
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:22,333
My 500 million has
gone down the drain!

945
01:18:22,334 --> 01:18:25,457
I don't even have short change.
- My 500 million!

946
01:18:26,122 --> 01:18:30,535
I'll get my money back! Somebody
buy me a ticket to tour the world!

947
01:18:55,218 --> 01:19:01,046
This is our money!
Jackpot!

948
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:07,664
Damn you!

949
01:19:42,296 --> 01:19:43,918
Bullseye!

950
01:19:43,919 --> 01:19:47,124
My Lord, you harass me a lot

951
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:51,411
Where do you always go
leaving me behind?

952
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:55,783
You wooed me back in Kerala.
For you, I went against my father

953
01:19:56,366 --> 01:19:59,445
I fought with my brother
and my uncles

954
01:19:59,446 --> 01:20:02,317
You brought me to a foreign land,
I didn't resist

955
01:20:02,318 --> 01:20:05,979
Why do you always disappear
like a horse?

956
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,019
You are a Punjabi, I'm a Malayali

957
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:11,350
I'm observing a fast
for your long life

958
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:16,221
But where are you? I can't break
my fast without seeing you

959
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:21,048
Where are you?
- Hi sis

960
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:24,463
Eighteen scoundrels died
and I was born

961
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:28,791
You are hungry, aren't you?
Eat your husband up

962
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,746
No more worries. Once he's out
of the way, there'll be no problems

963
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,074
How could you say such things
about your brother-in-law?

964
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:39,905
My brother-in-law is
of the stud genre

965
01:20:40,489 --> 01:20:43,901
I'm not of the ass genre
unless I rein him in

966
01:20:44,568 --> 01:20:47,522
Don't you malign our family

967
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:50,604
Whatever we are, we mustn't
make it obvious. Okay, darling?

968
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:56,804
I mustn't? I'd rather take
his hat off and thrash him!

969
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:06,753
Okay, sis. I'm going to find him
and bring him back home!

970
01:21:13,038 --> 01:21:15,494
What are you doing here?
Take the wheels

971
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:18,782
Are you going to India?
- I'm fleeing to India

972
01:21:19,324 --> 01:21:23,653
Fleeing? From your wife?
- From my brother-in-law, too

973
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:27,400
They are a bloody menace.
- What?

974
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:31,563
I mean, disturb me... what they say?
- Harass?

975
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:37,013
C'mon, start the car,
I'm getting late

976
01:21:37,014 --> 01:21:41,968
That side!

977
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:49,294
Are you also going
to drive like that?

978
01:22:05,278 --> 01:22:11,771
Give your wife or brother-in-law
the slip, but please spare me

979
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:17,265
Here you are

980
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,304
500 dollars...?

981
01:22:20,305 --> 01:22:24,717
Sir...

982
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,752
There's a taxi

983
01:22:29,753 --> 01:22:33,292
He's back already?
Got into new clothes in no time

984
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,745
Put the stuff in the car, quick.
- But you were going to India...

985
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:41,493
fleeing from your wife, right?
- Me...? I just arrived from India

986
01:22:41,908 --> 01:22:45,239
Rubbish. I picked you up
from Michael street

987
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:48,360
Damn, he's off his rockers.
- This is the first time...

988
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:53,272
he's flown abroad. He's a scrooge.
Won't even dream about a foreign land

989
01:22:53,729 --> 01:22:56,477
Why not?
- To save expenses. He's here...

990
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:59,349
out of sheer helplessness.
- What makes him so helpless?

991
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,888
Shall I tell him?

992
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:03,386
A chap ran away
with his daughter

993
01:23:03,387 --> 01:23:06,050
Aren't you ashamed to reveal
family matters to strangers?

994
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:09,464
Brother-in-law, if we want them to
help us, we must tell them the truth

995
01:23:09,465 --> 01:23:13,293
Is it?
- Yes

996
01:23:13,294 --> 01:23:18,330
Where are you going?
Get back

997
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:20,951
Have you seen them?

998
01:23:20,952 --> 01:23:25,572
Have I...? Oh yes! I dropped them
at Hotel Hill, ten days back

999
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:29,360
Ten days back?
- Yes. He was boasting away

1000
01:23:29,361 --> 01:23:33,357
Said, he stayed for 8 days in Paris,
12 days in Switzerland...

1001
01:23:33,856 --> 01:23:37,560
18 days in London... he was talking
as if he was a millionaire

1002
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:41,390
Millionaire, my foot! Bloody pauper!
He's blowing up my money

1003
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:45,844
Take me there! I'll reward you
the way no Indian ever did

1004
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:52,004
Really? Let's go

1005
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:53,359
Mummy here, dear

1006
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,398
Raj here, mummy.
- Kiran's daddy has left India

1007
01:24:57,065 --> 01:24:59,644
He's been trying to trace you
you since ten days

1008
01:24:59,645 --> 01:25:02,724
He has found out where you are put up.
He must be reaching there any time

1009
01:25:02,725 --> 01:25:06,305
Don't worry. We've fixed the worst.
We'll fix daddy, too

1010
01:25:06,763 --> 01:25:11,176
Okay, son

1011
01:25:13,422 --> 01:25:18,210
What?
- A few tears

1012
01:25:25,994 --> 01:25:30,406
Wrestler...

1013
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:38,149
It's serious

1014
01:26:09,035 --> 01:26:12,362
Bullseye

1015
01:26:12,363 --> 01:26:16,485
Great place, brother-in-law

1016
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:26,308
Grand hotel

1017
01:26:26,308 --> 01:26:30,762
It's the biggest resort around here.
I dropped them right here

1018
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:35,424
Couldn't you find a third-class hotel?
- It wasn't my idea, though

1019
01:26:36,008 --> 01:26:39,377
Our stuff! He's taking them away.
- Easy, brother-in-law

1020
01:26:39,378 --> 01:26:42,500
Put it down.
- Put it down, please

1021
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:49,910
Sir, you were supposed to reward me
like no Indian ever did

1022
01:26:51,324 --> 01:26:57,693
Oh yes. I was too tensed
to remember

1023
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:01,023
Take this.
- What's this?

1024
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:03,478
Sand-lizard oil.
Hold it

1025
01:27:03,479 --> 01:27:07,226
If someone hits you, whacks you,
thrashes you...

1026
01:27:07,642 --> 01:27:10,388
just apply this all over your body.
The pain will disappear in half-hour

1027
01:27:10,389 --> 01:27:13,301
You'll be ready to take more blows.
- Shameless oil, I must say!

1028
01:27:13,302 --> 01:27:19,546
Take care of it,
while I look for that shameless boy

1029
01:27:19,547 --> 01:27:22,752
Conned a smart guy like me.
How strange

1030
01:27:36,947 --> 01:27:40,818
He's staying in a grand hotel.
He's ruined all your money

1031
01:27:41,358 --> 01:27:45,646
Stop rubbing salt into my wounds.
- A cup of tea must cost 350 bucks

1032
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:49,558
Shut up.
- An omelette must cost 500 bucks

1033
01:27:50,058 --> 01:27:55,885
I'll scratch your face.
- This way

1034
01:27:55,886 --> 01:28:00,214
Brother-in-law, room number 605

1035
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:02,128
Get the stick

1036
01:28:02,129 --> 01:28:05,000
The stick's treated with oil.
Use it carefully

1037
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:06,915
What do you mean?
- He's young

1038
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:09,329
Don't hit in the wrong place.
- Shut up

1039
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:12,535
I'm going to hit him to a sixer.
- Hail Hanuman

1040
01:28:18,321 --> 01:28:20,943
His voice has changed

1041
01:28:20,944 --> 01:28:24,774
That's because he swallowed my money.
I'll beat the hell out of him

1042
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:31,350
I'll rip him apart. Gather the pieces.
- Sure

1043
01:28:35,096 --> 01:28:40,299
I'm dead! Mother!

1044
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,667
Sounds like brother-in-law

1045
01:28:46,668 --> 01:28:49,707
Is he beating or getting beaten up?
Can't figure it out

1046
01:28:56,366 --> 01:29:00,404
Brother-in-law, I told you
to be careful. He's young

1047
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:04,358
No, he's a wrestler.
Look at that

1048
01:29:07,023 --> 01:29:10,186
Take this trash out.
- All right, sir. Sorry, sir

1049
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:15,764
He beat me black and blue.
Which room did you send me in?

1050
01:29:16,346 --> 01:29:19,801
605!
- Did you check the room number?

1051
01:29:20,342 --> 01:29:23,338
I did.
- This foreign land has disgraced you

1052
01:29:23,339 --> 01:29:25,336
Let's get out of here. Get up

1053
01:29:25,337 --> 01:29:29,583
So sorry

1054
01:29:29,584 --> 01:29:32,747
Take this. Sand-lizard oil

1055
01:29:33,329 --> 01:29:35,743
If you are beaten up,
thrashed or whacked...

1056
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,323
you will be ready in half-hour
to take more blows

1057
01:29:38,324 --> 01:29:41,779
I see. I've run out of gas

1058
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,443
Else, I'd have made this day
memorable for you

1059
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:49,354
Apply it to your taxi
when it meets with an accident

1060
01:29:49,355 --> 01:29:53,101
lt'll be fixed. Get lost

1061
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,764
See? He serves me with the same sauce.
- Insolent

1062
01:29:57,431 --> 01:29:59,469
Who?
- He! Not you

1063
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:03,007
I won't spare him if I find him.
- Who?

1064
01:30:03,008 --> 01:30:05,296
Him! What's his name?
- Raj?

1065
01:30:05,297 --> 01:30:09,793
Yes. I'll beat the music out of him!
- Music?

1066
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:50,377
"When my heart beats..."

1067
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:54,040
"it feels like..."

1068
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,495
"you are hiding..."

1069
01:30:57,496 --> 01:31:01,449
"somewhere inside
my heart, my love"

1070
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:04,737
"In every breath of mine..."

1071
01:31:04,738 --> 01:31:08,275
"the fragrance
of your breath lingers"

1072
01:31:08,276 --> 01:31:11,357
"It's etched in my memories;..."

1073
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:16,309
"the season of your love"

1074
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:19,680
"My love..."

1075
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,344
"my sweetheart..."

1076
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:26,341
"my honey..."

1077
01:31:26,342 --> 01:31:30,045
"you are my darling"

1078
01:31:30,046 --> 01:31:33,500
"When my heart beats..."

1079
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:36,623
"it feels like..."

1080
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:40,951
"you are hiding..."

1081
01:31:40,952 --> 01:31:47,362
"somewhere inside
my heart, my love"

1082
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:20,454
"Obsession is taking over"

1083
01:32:20,995 --> 01:32:24,532
"It's driving me crazy"

1084
01:32:24,533 --> 01:32:27,613
"This rising intoxication..."

1085
01:32:28,321 --> 01:32:31,608
"is making me lose my composure"

1086
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:34,897
"It is dreams about you..."

1087
01:32:34,898 --> 01:32:38,270
"that invade my eyes every moment"

1088
01:32:39,018 --> 01:32:44,222
"My love..."

1089
01:32:49,342 --> 01:32:54,712
"O my love"

1090
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:50,572
"My loneliness urges me..."

1091
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:54,235
"to hold you in my arms"

1092
01:33:54,652 --> 01:33:58,355
"Let me forget the whole world"

1093
01:33:58,356 --> 01:34:01,518
"Let only your name linger
on my lips"

1094
01:34:01,519 --> 01:34:04,932
"All my life, sweetheart;..."

1095
01:34:04,933 --> 01:34:08,180
"my love for you is insatiable"

1096
01:34:09,054 --> 01:34:12,841
"My love..."

1097
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:16,295
"my sweetheart..."

1098
01:34:16,296 --> 01:34:19,292
"my honey..."

1099
01:34:19,293 --> 01:34:22,997
"you are my darling"

1100
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:26,368
"When my heart beats..."

1101
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:29,575
"it feels like..."

1102
01:34:30,074 --> 01:34:33,154
"you are hiding..."

1103
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:37,483
"somewhere inside
my heart, my love"

1104
01:34:37,484 --> 01:34:41,021
"In every breath of mine..."

1105
01:34:41,022 --> 01:34:44,517
"the fragrance
of your breath lingers"

1106
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:47,640
"It's etched in my memories;..."

1107
01:34:48,347 --> 01:34:54,175
"the season of your love"

1108
01:35:00,835 --> 01:35:05,788
Chicken, get them!

1109
01:35:09,285 --> 01:35:12,031
I've caught them!
Come on, quick

1110
01:35:12,032 --> 01:35:13,946
Don't let them go!

1111
01:35:13,947 --> 01:35:17,401
Double-crosser!
- He bought me a flight ticket

1112
01:35:17,402 --> 01:35:20,398
I got to show some gratitude.
If he returns without me...

1113
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:23,311
I'll be ruined. I'll have to
go around begging. Don't worry...

1114
01:35:23,312 --> 01:35:25,976
I'll let you go when he's near.
- Promise?

1115
01:35:25,977 --> 01:35:27,807
Promise.
- You won't betray us, will you?

1116
01:35:27,808 --> 01:35:31,012
I won't. I've got them,
brother-in-law! Come here, quick

1117
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:34,092
Hold them tight

1118
01:35:34,093 --> 01:35:37,797
Who is it?

1119
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:39,462
Go on, take a look

1120
01:35:39,463 --> 01:35:42,710
Is he a friend?
How could he grab him?

1121
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:45,331
Listen guys...

1122
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:48,953
I have found my brother-in-law!
- Brother-in-law, my foot! Let me go

1123
01:35:48,954 --> 01:35:52,324
How can I let you go?
My sis is observing a fast for you

1124
01:35:52,325 --> 01:35:55,780
I'm not going to leave you.
- Your sis? My wife?

1125
01:35:56,321 --> 01:35:59,109
You think you can con me
by forcing me into a relationship?

1126
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:03,563
Come home, and you will know.
Here goes...

1127
01:36:03,564 --> 01:36:06,560
I picked him up!
I found him!

1128
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:10,431
I picked him up!
I found him!

1129
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,262
Good Lord!

1130
01:36:12,263 --> 01:36:14,885
Look who I brought home

1131
01:36:14,886 --> 01:36:17,840
What have you done to my husband?
- Helped him sniff some chloroform...

1132
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:20,421
made him unconscious
and brought him home to you

1133
01:36:20,422 --> 01:36:24,292
He will come around, won't he?
- If he doesn't, I'll get you another

1134
01:36:24,293 --> 01:36:28,288
Lord! How could you say that?
He's my husband

1135
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:32,951
You dog!

1136
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:38,363
Wait, let's make a phonecall.
- All right

1137
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:44,022
Why do you sound so heavy, mummy?

1138
01:36:44,023 --> 01:36:46,894
I'm not mummy.
I'm an extortionist

1139
01:36:46,895 --> 01:36:48,352
Extortionist?

1140
01:36:48,353 --> 01:36:51,724
Raj, it's some extortionist.
Talk to him

1141
01:36:53,348 --> 01:36:55,386
Where do you go begging, sir?

1142
01:36:55,387 --> 01:36:58,342
Sonofagun!
I'm Shera's younger brother

1143
01:36:58,343 --> 01:37:02,755
My business runs on contracts. Fooling
around with me is fooling with death

1144
01:37:03,338 --> 01:37:06,667
What do you want?
- You got 500 million for free

1145
01:37:07,042 --> 01:37:09,747
I want 250 million

1146
01:37:09,748 --> 01:37:13,744
Are you grandma's relative?
- Not a relative. But I have a right

1147
01:37:14,327 --> 01:37:17,573
He has a right.
Then it's no good arguing

1148
01:37:17,574 --> 01:37:21,236
Come over to hotel Plantation.
You will get your 250 million

1149
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:24,939
All right

1150
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:28,353
Who was it, Raj?
- Someone wants to extort 250 million

1151
01:37:28,354 --> 01:37:33,390
Now what?
- Old trick. Water, please

1152
01:37:33,391 --> 01:37:35,555
Can't help it

1153
01:37:35,556 --> 01:37:37,553
More

1154
01:37:37,554 --> 01:37:39,342
More?

1155
01:37:39,343 --> 01:37:43,422
Wrestler!

1156
01:37:43,423 --> 01:37:47,834
Wrestler...

1157
01:37:50,332 --> 01:37:53,704
I've asked your help so many times
that I'm ashamed to ask for more

1158
01:37:58,032 --> 01:37:59,988
Shall I?

1159
01:37:59,989 --> 01:38:01,819
Shall I?

1160
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:04,025
Sure?

1161
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:08,439
Hear

1162
01:38:35,329 --> 01:38:37,368
Bullseye

1163
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:41,863
Look, we're not here to eat,
we're here to extort money

1164
01:38:42,447 --> 01:38:47,108
Sonofagun! Talk about money

1165
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:50,854
I'm giving you. You think I'll be
bringing all the money abroad? No way

1166
01:38:51,438 --> 01:38:54,519
That's why I've borrowed for someone

1167
01:38:54,976 --> 01:38:57,390
You borrowed money? From whom?

1168
01:38:57,391 --> 01:39:01,760
From him

1169
01:39:05,466 --> 01:39:08,505
Milkshake. It's healthy.
- I love milkshake

1170
01:39:09,128 --> 01:39:13,208
But I'm here to extort money,
not to make you serve us

1171
01:39:13,581 --> 01:39:15,330
Where's the money?
- Talk

1172
01:39:15,331 --> 01:39:18,743
You'd better eat now,
because you are going to get weak

1173
01:39:19,327 --> 01:39:23,448
Weak after eating? How's that?
- You'll find out later

1174
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,358
Come... the stuff is waiting for you.
- You are our first client who...

1175
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:32,355
has treated us to a sumptuous meal.
- The last, too

1176
01:39:32,356 --> 01:39:36,891
What did you say?
- Nothing. The stuff's waiting for you

1177
01:39:36,892 --> 01:39:40,637
The swine conned us. No one here.
Where's the money, brother?

1178
01:39:40,638 --> 01:39:43,344
Where's our money?

1179
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:45,383
Want money, eh?

1180
01:39:45,384 --> 01:39:46,923
Who is it?
- Want money, eh?

1181
01:39:46,924 --> 01:39:51,961
Yes.
- Yes

1182
01:39:58,536 --> 01:40:00,410
How much did you get?

1183
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:03,032
Nothing?
Okay, take them away, please

1184
01:40:03,033 --> 01:40:07,903
I won't spare you

1185
01:40:10,067 --> 01:40:14,646
Bullseye

1186
01:40:24,345 --> 01:40:27,341
My Lord...
- Get lost, maid

1187
01:40:27,342 --> 01:40:30,796
Gosh! I'm your wife.
- You look like a sweeper

1188
01:40:31,338 --> 01:40:34,792
Don't say that.
You are my husband, I'm your wife

1189
01:40:35,334 --> 01:40:38,038
Are you out of your mind?
My wife is in Mumbai

1190
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:42,576
In Mumbai? Gosh!
One wife in India, another here!

1191
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:45,323
How dare you?
I'm going to sauce you

1192
01:40:45,324 --> 01:40:48,819
Hardly matters. My wife is in Mumbai.
You are not my wife

1193
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:52,691
You forget. You saw me
in a discotheque in Kerala

1194
01:40:53,066 --> 01:40:56,354
You spent a lot of money... it was fun.
- Hang on

1195
01:40:56,355 --> 01:40:58,475
I spent money on you?
- Yes

1196
01:40:58,476 --> 01:41:01,307
Wrong number.
I'm a first rate scrooge

1197
01:41:01,308 --> 01:41:04,387
If my money falls into the gutter,
I recover it, clean it up...

1198
01:41:04,388 --> 01:41:06,968
and put it back into my wallet.
How can I spend it on you?

1199
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:09,299
You are joking

1200
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,754
Now that I've taken a look at you,
I can eat

1201
01:41:13,296 --> 01:41:19,748
Consume poison. I'll offer...
Who's that?

1202
01:41:22,828 --> 01:41:25,950
She's passed out. I should leave
before I'm caught again

1203
01:41:35,108 --> 01:41:39,560
Did you find them?
- They flew away to India today

1204
01:41:40,935 --> 01:41:44,014
Flown already? Which flight?
- Air India

1205
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:47,221
Book tickets for the next flight.
We're going to India right away

1206
01:41:47,594 --> 01:41:51,258
I'll wring that lawyer's neck,
tear his clothes up...

1207
01:41:51,674 --> 01:41:56,877
break his teeth, and I'll...
- Enough!

1208
01:42:00,623 --> 01:42:03,410
Lawyer! May you be ruined

1209
01:42:03,411 --> 01:42:06,407
Where's that lawyer who made me
lose my 500 million?

1210
01:42:06,408 --> 01:42:09,739
He's bathing upstairs.
- Getting wet after drying me up?

1211
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,442
Wait till I change his colour!
- Sir, don't go there

1212
01:42:13,443 --> 01:42:17,191
The bathroom doesn't have a latch.
- I'd even swallow the door

1213
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:23,390
Lawyer! May you be ruined

1214
01:42:23,391 --> 01:42:27,138
Where are you, lawyer?

1215
01:42:27,139 --> 01:42:30,676
How did you enter?
- I'd even enter the bathtub

1216
01:42:31,383 --> 01:42:34,048
Who the hell are you?

1217
01:42:34,049 --> 01:42:37,919
I'm 500 million! 500 million.
- Yes, I recognise you

1218
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,371
Get up.
- Aren't you ashamed? One moment

1219
01:42:42,372 --> 01:42:45,785
I'm naked.
- I'll have you paraded naked

1220
01:42:45,786 --> 01:42:49,364
Give me my 500 million.
- Your 500 million? What 500 million?

1221
01:42:49,365 --> 01:42:52,613
I'll have this telecast live.
- I'm naked

1222
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,358
Give me my 500 million.
- I gave it away

1223
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:58,355
Why? Was it your father's money?
Where's my grandma's will?

1224
01:42:58,356 --> 01:43:01,021
Which grandma? I'm naked.
- Don't remember my grandma's will?

1225
01:43:01,022 --> 01:43:02,894
My grandma's will?
- I'll give it to you

1226
01:43:02,895 --> 01:43:04,975
Let go the towel
- After you give me her will

1227
01:43:04,976 --> 01:43:07,306
Okay, I'll get it... give me towel.
- No, you will escape

1228
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:11,011
Where can a naked man run?
- I don't trust you

1229
01:43:11,012 --> 01:43:13,382
Get it, I'll be right here.
- All right

1230
01:43:13,383 --> 01:43:15,007
I'll even chase you outside

1231
01:43:15,008 --> 01:43:18,295
No girl ever saw me naked,
but this chap has seen me

1232
01:43:18,295 --> 01:43:22,999
Here you go

1233
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,829
On the basis of this will,
I'll go to court

1234
01:43:27,411 --> 01:43:33,947
I'll go to each and every court
in the country

1235
01:43:34,654 --> 01:43:38,066
Any other courts you know about?
- Raincoat and overcoat

1236
01:43:38,067 --> 01:43:41,312
I'll go there... what did you say?
- Nothing. Go wherever you want

1237
01:43:41,313 --> 01:43:45,643
I'll go to all the courts and get
my 500 million back. Just you watch

1238
01:43:50,055 --> 01:43:53,884
You barged into my house, eh?
I'll sue you

1239
01:43:53,885 --> 01:43:58,295
Do that after you pick up
the towel, sir

1240
01:43:58,296 --> 01:44:01,376
Where the hell are you?
Come out

1241
01:44:01,377 --> 01:44:07,495
Bloody fraud! Lmposter

1242
01:44:07,496 --> 01:44:11,367
Sonofagun! Show up.
I'm here

1243
01:44:11,951 --> 01:44:15,363
Talk to me.
Get me milkshake

1244
01:44:15,988 --> 01:44:19,567
Must ask my master.
- Master? I'm your master

1245
01:44:19,943 --> 01:44:22,980
This is my bungalow.
Get it

1246
01:44:22,981 --> 01:44:24,436
Okay

1247
01:44:24,437 --> 01:44:27,059
Polish my shoes.
- Your shoes?

1248
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:30,305
Do it, will you? Or I'll tonsure you!
- I'll do it

1249
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:34,344
Go and tell him that disaster is here.
- Are you Mr Disaster, sir?

1250
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:37,590
I'm disaster for him.
Call him, or I'll smash you

1251
01:44:37,591 --> 01:44:43,960
I'll call him.
- Where was he picked up from?

1252
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:51,077
Welcome, father-in-law

1253
01:44:51,078 --> 01:44:55,406
Why are you grinning?
- Because it's time for you to cry

1254
01:44:56,073 --> 01:44:59,401
Are you going to die?
- Not yet. After I've killed you

1255
01:44:59,402 --> 01:45:02,232
Really?
- Your temporary reign is over

1256
01:45:02,233 --> 01:45:04,271
Your game is up.
- Really?

1257
01:45:04,272 --> 01:45:08,685
When you see my granny's will,
your heart will break into a shrill

1258
01:45:09,267 --> 01:45:14,303
Granny's will?
- Want to see?

1259
01:45:14,304 --> 01:45:17,009
Here's my granny's will

1260
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:19,881
Is that a will?
- You think it's a bill?

1261
01:45:19,882 --> 01:45:24,002
Is it original?
- Absolutely

1262
01:45:24,003 --> 01:45:30,081
Show me.
- What do you want to see? Look

1263
01:45:31,828 --> 01:45:34,034
What have you done?

1264
01:45:34,035 --> 01:45:37,447
What the hell have you done?
- You swallowed my grandpa's receipt

1265
01:45:37,448 --> 01:45:41,319
So I swallowed your grandma's will.
- But the will was worth 500 million!

1266
01:45:42,027 --> 01:45:45,523
I'll eat you up alive.
I'll kill myself and accuse you

1267
01:45:46,023 --> 01:45:49,144
I'll become a ghost and eat you up,
eat your entire family up

1268
01:45:49,144 --> 01:45:51,100
Keep it low.
- Okay... what did you say?

1269
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:54,014
Lower your voice. Shut up.
- You ask me to shut up?

1270
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:56,511
Go away or I'll have you thrown out.
- You will throw me out?

1271
01:45:56,512 --> 01:45:59,341
Not me. The dogs will.
- Dogs? Don't you touch me

1272
01:45:59,342 --> 01:46:03,797
Not him. The dogs.
Rocky! Rambo

1273
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:25,315
Bloody fraud! Lmposter

1274
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:28,605
You swallowed my 500 million?
500 million worms will eat you up

1275
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,767
You will go bald. 500 million worms,
each the size of a melon...

1276
01:46:33,308 --> 01:46:35,972
will eat you up. Swine

1277
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:40,759
The shop you go will crumble on your
head, in fact the whole building will

1278
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:45,713
You can't digest a penny...
- Belting out in-vogue curses?

1279
01:46:46,295 --> 01:46:49,875
That swine swallowed my 500 million.
Could you buy some poison...

1280
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:54,787
and consume it? I wish to die.
- If he has swallowed your money...

1281
01:46:55,328 --> 01:47:00,532
I got an idea. He'll fall at your feet
and give you every penny back

1282
01:47:00,948 --> 01:47:04,985
What if he doesn't?
- Then I'm not my neighbour's son

1283
01:47:04,986 --> 01:47:07,024
You are your neighbour's son?
- Right

1284
01:47:07,025 --> 01:47:10,479
Hardly matters. I don't care
if you get me back my millions

1285
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,935
Can you get it back for me?
- What will you offer me?

1286
01:47:15,017 --> 01:47:18,597
Anything, other than the 500 million.
I can give you my coat right now

1287
01:47:19,054 --> 01:47:22,509
I'll marry your daughter. What say?
- My daughter?

1288
01:47:22,510 --> 01:47:25,798
You can even marry my wife.
Take her away, she is a menace

1289
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:30,543
Oh no! I want a jasmine,
not a cauliflower

1290
01:47:31,084 --> 01:47:34,372
Meaning?
- I want your daughter

1291
01:47:34,373 --> 01:47:38,493
Very well. You get me my 500 million,
I'll marry my daughter off to you

1292
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:41,156
Now watch what magic
Bobby Topi works

1293
01:47:41,157 --> 01:47:44,736
Round the clock! My eyes
will be trained like a telescope...

1294
01:47:44,737 --> 01:47:47,067
on that swine.
- Swine? Who?

1295
01:47:47,068 --> 01:47:52,521
Raj.
- Then why're you pointing towards me?

1296
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,531
One, two, three...

1297
01:48:22,532 --> 01:48:25,029
four, five, six...

1298
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:27,402
are you guys thugs?
- Yes

1299
01:48:27,403 --> 01:48:31,815
In this age of AK47 guns, you go
around with these pen-knives?

1300
01:48:32,356 --> 01:48:34,644
What a shame!

1301
01:48:34,645 --> 01:48:38,850
No smart talk!
- No knives, they scare me... please

1302
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,469
You're scared of knives?
- Very much so

1303
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:46,466
So look at this. A bomb

1304
01:48:46,467 --> 01:48:49,421
To blow you to smithereens

1305
01:48:49,422 --> 01:48:53,710
Raj, they're rough-necks.
They won't heed any reason

1306
01:48:54,376 --> 01:49:00,745
So what are you thinking about?
Get cracking... go on!

1307
01:49:03,325 --> 01:49:05,988
One moment, one moment

1308
01:49:05,989 --> 01:49:09,318
Hey guys, won't it be a shame
if a girl beats you up...?

1309
01:49:09,319 --> 01:49:12,315
Speak the truth. No lies.
Only the truth

1310
01:49:12,316 --> 01:49:18,060
So take a beating from me

1311
01:49:57,354 --> 01:50:01,808
Give it to them!
Bruce Lee style!

1312
01:50:16,335 --> 01:50:21,372
Enough, enough

1313
01:50:52,424 --> 01:50:55,545
Don't hit me! Don't!

1314
01:50:55,546 --> 01:50:58,917
Forgive me... please!

1315
01:50:58,918 --> 01:51:04,704
I will, but go and bring
those cripples back

1316
01:51:13,528 --> 01:51:16,357
What a thrashing!

1317
01:51:16,358 --> 01:51:20,563
Who paid you to beat me up?
- It was Bobby Topi, sir

1318
01:51:21,145 --> 01:51:22,851
What are you doing...?
- How much?

1319
01:51:22,852 --> 01:51:26,765
20,000 rupees, sir.
- 20,000? What a shame!

1320
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:30,011
How could you guys sell out for
so little in these days of inflation?

1321
01:51:30,012 --> 01:51:32,341
You guys ought to raise the price!

1322
01:51:32,342 --> 01:51:36,796
Know what? I'll pay you 40 grand.
Thrash Bobby Topi and bring him to me

1323
01:51:37,504 --> 01:51:39,334
40 grand...?

1324
01:51:39,335 --> 01:51:42,415
At once, sir.
Just wait here

1325
01:51:42,416 --> 01:51:45,495
Right now, sir...
Let's go, boys!

1326
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:49,866
What are you doing?

1327
01:51:50,116 --> 01:51:52,321
You guys have switched loyalties?

1328
01:51:52,322 --> 01:51:56,026
But I've even paid you!

1329
01:51:56,027 --> 01:52:01,397
What are you guys doing...?
You've crossed over?

1330
01:52:07,765 --> 01:52:12,177
Don't hit me! Don't!

1331
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:27,787
I was out of my mind to target you
at Raj Saxena's say-so

1332
01:52:29,327 --> 01:52:32,407
You are now my sister, Kiran.
And you are my brother-in-law

1333
01:52:32,408 --> 01:52:34,655
Forgive me. Those guys
gave me such a thrashing!

1334
01:52:34,656 --> 01:52:38,235
Yes, I'll forgive you.
But I have a condition

1335
01:52:39,317 --> 01:52:42,979
Someone spoke about a bomb...
- Here you are, sir

1336
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:46,644
Plant this bomb in my
to-be father-in-law's house, okay?

1337
01:52:47,351 --> 01:52:52,720
As you say!
- Go on

1338
01:52:55,343 --> 01:53:01,254
It isn't a bomb that kills.
It just explodes

1339
01:53:03,085 --> 01:53:05,082
Who is it?
- Me

1340
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:08,079
Who's me?
- Brother-in-law...

1341
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:11,160
what sort of relatives you have!
They came from the villages to beg!

1342
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:14,406
I've come to give something,
not to take from you

1343
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:16,613
To give? Why didn't you
say that earlier?

1344
01:53:16,614 --> 01:53:20,317
Let's go and collect!

1345
01:53:20,318 --> 01:53:23,314
Hey! It's you?
How did all this happen?

1346
01:53:23,315 --> 01:53:26,976
You went well-dressed...
so how are you in tatters?

1347
01:53:26,977 --> 01:53:30,307
The job is done, Uncle.
- Yes? How's the enemy doing?

1348
01:53:30,308 --> 01:53:32,388
From my state, you can guess
how the enemy's doing, Uncle

1349
01:53:32,389 --> 01:53:35,385
They must be in tatters too!
How about the 500 million?

1350
01:53:35,386 --> 01:53:38,674
Here's your 500 million. I'm going!
- Just this much?

1351
01:53:38,674 --> 01:53:41,837
Big denomination notes? Take a look.
- Let me see

1352
01:53:44,336 --> 01:53:47,873
Brother-in-law, it isn't 500 million!
It's a bomb! A bomb!

1353
01:53:49,663 --> 01:53:53,700
You keep it!
- Throw it

1354
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:56,864
As a youngster, you used to
throw flowers at me. Green ones

1355
01:53:57,364 --> 01:54:00,528
And now you throw green balls?
- It's not a ball. It's a bomb!

1356
01:54:00,943 --> 01:54:02,358
What...?

1357
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:05,272
Blow up your husband if you must.
Why target me?

1358
01:54:05,273 --> 01:54:10,309
What are you doing?

1359
01:54:11,017 --> 01:54:16,137
Get it out!

1360
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:44,316
Bloody scoundrel!

1361
01:54:44,317 --> 01:54:47,605
You made us rot in this
prison for six months

1362
01:54:47,605 --> 01:54:52,975
We're not sparing you now

1363
01:55:10,333 --> 01:55:13,787
Anyone there...?
Where are you?

1364
01:55:14,329 --> 01:55:17,493
Sonofagun! Where are you?

1365
01:55:18,949 --> 01:55:23,277
Come on out!
Where are you hiding?

1366
01:55:23,278 --> 01:55:28,356
Where are you holed up?

1367
01:55:35,266 --> 01:55:40,927
Step out! Raj!

1368
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:48,128
Where are you hiding, you swine?
Come on out!

1369
01:55:54,538 --> 01:55:57,494
Brother, he's the one!

1370
01:55:57,495 --> 01:56:00,074
Hey laddie... come here

1371
01:56:00,075 --> 01:56:05,403
Me?
- Yes. Come here

1372
01:56:09,233 --> 01:56:12,727
So laddie, you know me?

1373
01:56:12,728 --> 01:56:16,142
We never met. We never got talking.
We never asked each others names...

1374
01:56:16,434 --> 01:56:21,261
so how would I know you?
- Don't you play with fire!

1375
01:56:21,262 --> 01:56:23,343
Look in my eyes!

1376
01:56:23,344 --> 01:56:26,713
You can see in them
your funeral pyre

1377
01:56:26,714 --> 01:56:31,169
Look at the kohl. You can see
the ashes of your remains

1378
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:36,079
What do you want...?
- Silly sonofagun!

1379
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:39,576
You showed my brothers the insides
of a foreign jail, didn't you?

1380
01:56:40,035 --> 01:56:43,323
But I still didn't hang you

1381
01:56:43,324 --> 01:56:46,818
Because we want a small part
out of your 500 million

1382
01:56:46,819 --> 01:56:49,317
250 million.
- What rubbish!

1383
01:56:49,318 --> 01:56:52,979
I wouldn't give you 25 cents!
- Listen, laddie...

1384
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:56,851
should you do that, we'll make
25 pieces of your body...

1385
01:56:57,393 --> 01:57:00,389
put them in a gunny bag
and dump them in the backwaters

1386
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,345
The fishes will feed on you

1387
01:57:02,346 --> 01:57:06,632
Why're you harassing
a young man, sir?

1388
01:57:07,008 --> 01:57:10,420
He's a young man.
His blood has reached boiling point

1389
01:57:10,421 --> 01:57:14,708
But you needn't worry.
You will have what you need

1390
01:57:15,333 --> 01:57:19,536
No needs! I want my 250 million
here and now

1391
01:57:20,994 --> 01:57:24,781
Sir, does anyone keep such a huge
amount of money in his house?

1392
01:57:25,365 --> 01:57:28,027
We'll go the bank tomorrow,
withdraw the money...

1393
01:57:28,028 --> 01:57:33,022
and give it to you.
- Smart man

1394
01:57:33,023 --> 01:57:36,561
I'll come tomorrow evening.
To collect my 250 million

1395
01:57:37,353 --> 01:57:41,806
No tricks with me, okay?
- My lord and master...

1396
01:57:42,348 --> 01:57:46,384
no tricks at all, sir!
See you tomorrow

1397
01:57:46,385 --> 01:57:52,754
We haven't forgotten the bars.
- We'll fix you yet

1398
01:57:53,004 --> 01:57:56,916
I wouldn't give them 25 pennies
and you promised him 250 million?

1399
01:57:57,957 --> 01:58:01,786
After much thought, I have
acceded to a small request

1400
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:04,740
All in your interests, son

1401
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:07,988
Hey Emperor of Bihar!

1402
01:58:07,989 --> 01:58:11,110
Hey Laloo, darling
of every heart

1403
01:58:11,111 --> 01:58:14,314
O sweetheart!

1404
01:58:14,315 --> 01:58:17,687
It's your friend speaking.
Raj Saxena

1405
01:58:18,644 --> 01:58:23,597
There's this young chap who has
swallowed 500 million from me...

1406
01:58:24,098 --> 01:58:27,676
and he just won't think
of returning it to me

1407
01:58:27,677 --> 01:58:31,589
Really? I know, you're good
at toppling governments

1408
01:58:32,922 --> 01:58:36,043
Where are you sending this chap?
To the Tihar Jail?

1409
01:58:36,044 --> 01:58:40,747
The oval cell?

1410
01:58:47,406 --> 01:58:50,402
Sir, I had no idea you have
connections in such high places

1411
01:58:50,403 --> 01:58:53,567
You know now? So aren't you scared?
- I surely am

1412
01:58:54,068 --> 01:58:57,064
Which is why I've brought documents
of my land and property

1413
01:58:57,065 --> 01:58:58,436
Where are they?
- Outside

1414
01:58:58,437 --> 01:59:03,724
Someone will bolt with them!
It has to do with 500 million!

1415
01:59:06,387 --> 01:59:10,424
One moment... who's inside?

1416
01:59:10,425 --> 01:59:13,630
Welcome, welcome Mr Millionaire

1417
01:59:13,631 --> 01:59:16,753
Let me become a millionaire first.
- Very soon you will be

1418
01:59:17,668 --> 01:59:20,332
So ladies and gentlemen...

1419
01:59:20,332 --> 01:59:24,536
you folks are witness that I'm
returning every penny to him

1420
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:28,990
This is the key to his 80 million
worth bungalow...

1421
01:59:28,991 --> 01:59:33,195
which I will vacate in a week.
And here are the keys of his cars

1422
01:59:33,694 --> 01:59:37,355
That makes it 90 million in all.
Right?

1423
01:59:37,356 --> 01:59:40,644
How about the cash?
- I bought jewellery for your daughter

1424
01:59:40,645 --> 01:59:42,851
I spent so much on her abroad.
Who'll pay for that?

1425
01:59:42,852 --> 01:59:45,347
You will. She's your girlfriend.
Why must I pick up the bill?

1426
01:59:45,348 --> 01:59:47,345
Out with the cash!

1427
01:59:47,346 --> 01:59:49,510
The bungalow and cars worth
90 million...

1428
01:59:49,511 --> 01:59:53,339
and here's a bank draft
worth 160 million

1429
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,963
That makes it 250 million.
Where's the other 250 million?

1430
01:59:55,964 --> 01:59:58,003
I told you, I spent it
on your daughter

1431
01:59:58,004 --> 02:00:00,332
250 million on a daughter...?
Are you crazy!

1432
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:02,456
I could 2500 daughters with
that kind of money

1433
02:00:02,457 --> 02:00:05,327
I'm not paying for it! Give me the
money or I'll be the worst yet

1434
02:00:05,328 --> 02:00:07,367
Brother-in-law...

1435
02:00:07,368 --> 02:00:10,531
you can't do any harm to him.
- Why not?

1436
02:00:10,532 --> 02:00:15,194
He has eaten up grandma's will.
- But I have Yadav on my side

1437
02:00:16,401 --> 02:00:19,313
That was a fake phonecall!
- How do you know?

1438
02:00:19,314 --> 02:00:22,854
I've listened to it myself.
Never mind... listen to me

1439
02:00:23,436 --> 02:00:26,850
Take whatever he's giving you.
Something's better than nothing

1440
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:30,386
But he's taking away 250 million!
- You're getting the rest, aren't you?

1441
02:00:30,387 --> 02:00:32,801
That's too little.
- Take it. Accept it!

1442
02:00:32,802 --> 02:00:36,215
Someone else might take it away.
Pounce on it! Go on!

1443
02:00:41,376 --> 02:00:44,330
What nuisance? Say good things!
- But what is to happen will happen

1444
02:00:44,331 --> 02:00:48,035
What is going to happen?
- Who can avert what is destined?

1445
02:00:48,036 --> 02:00:53,448
Let's pose for pictures...
- What's going to happen!

1446
02:01:29,745 --> 02:01:33,658
"You've stolen my heart.
Don't ever look away from me..."

1447
02:01:34,323 --> 02:01:38,611
"don't ever forget
how much I love you"

1448
02:01:40,817 --> 02:01:44,688
"You've stolen my heart.
Don't ever look away from me..."

1449
02:01:45,312 --> 02:01:49,225
"don't ever forget
how much I love you"

1450
02:01:56,718 --> 02:02:00,214
"I realised I was in love..."

1451
02:02:00,672 --> 02:02:04,793
"when people started calling me
the crazy one"

1452
02:02:05,292 --> 02:02:08,914
"You've stolen my heart.
Don't ever look away from me..."

1453
02:02:09,538 --> 02:02:13,534
"don't ever forget
how much I love you"

1454
02:02:20,736 --> 02:02:24,690
"I don't know how
this legend was made..."

1455
02:02:25,355 --> 02:02:29,185
"I could never get to know,
nor did you"

1456
02:03:15,639 --> 02:03:19,510
"You are the peace
of my heart..."

1457
02:03:19,968 --> 02:03:23,631
"you are the one
I thirst for"

1458
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:32,288
"Sweetheart, do you even
realise my feelings?"

1459
02:03:33,329 --> 02:03:37,200
"You are the one I think of
when I sleep..."

1460
02:03:37,741 --> 02:03:41,613
"you are the one
I dream of"

1461
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,858
"For you, my heart..."

1462
02:03:46,483 --> 02:03:50,562
"pines so much"

1463
02:03:58,346 --> 02:04:01,801
"Don't ever put my love
to test, my love"

1464
02:04:02,592 --> 02:04:06,505
"You've driven me crazy,
don't drive me to madness"

1465
02:04:07,045 --> 02:04:10,750
"You've stolen my heart.
Don't ever look away from me..."

1466
02:04:11,416 --> 02:04:16,536
"don't ever forget
how much I love you"

1467
02:04:57,412 --> 02:05:01,948
"We have met..."

1468
02:05:01,949 --> 02:05:05,487
"to romance"

1469
02:05:06,278 --> 02:05:10,191
"What else do we need..."

1470
02:05:10,607 --> 02:05:14,519
"in life?"

1471
02:05:14,936 --> 02:05:18,599
"For a moment..."

1472
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:23,510
"don't ever go away from me"

1473
02:05:24,093 --> 02:05:27,631
"I have you..."

1474
02:05:28,298 --> 02:05:32,169
"I don't ever want
to lose you"

1475
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:43,824
"Hide me in your eyes
every moment"

1476
02:05:44,365 --> 02:05:48,402
"Hold me to your bosom
every moment of my life"

1477
02:05:48,819 --> 02:05:52,690
"You've stolen my heart.
Don't ever look away from me..."

1478
02:05:53,314 --> 02:05:57,435
"don't ever forget
how much I love you"

1479
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:01,639
"I don't know how
this legend was made..."

1480
02:06:02,264 --> 02:06:06,135
"I could never get to know,
nor did you"

1481
02:06:33,274 --> 02:06:36,521
Shera-bhai, I hope you now believe
how we've been robbed

1482
02:06:37,353 --> 02:06:40,307
We had millions till yesterday.
But we're paupers today

1483
02:06:40,308 --> 02:06:42,305
What do you mean?

1484
02:06:42,306 --> 02:06:46,301
I mean, I can't even
offer you tea today

1485
02:06:46,302 --> 02:06:51,465
Make a call to Saxena! Hurry

1486
02:06:53,671 --> 02:06:55,043
It's me here. Me

1487
02:06:55,044 --> 02:06:57,582
Why bleat like a goat?
Are you getting sacrificed?

1488
02:06:57,583 --> 02:06:59,996
I don't get sacrificed.
I bite

1489
02:06:59,997 --> 02:07:02,869
Are you a dog?
- Hey! Listen carefully

1490
02:07:02,869 --> 02:07:04,700
I have nice ears.
Carry on with the rubbish

1491
02:07:04,701 --> 02:07:07,530
You got the bungalow
yesterday morning?

1492
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:09,445
So I did.
Why does it make you jealous?

1493
02:07:09,446 --> 02:07:12,693
You got the money too?
- Yes. What's biting you?

1494
02:07:13,068 --> 02:07:16,313
I'm about to do something.
Which is why I'm getting you to agree

1495
02:07:16,314 --> 02:07:19,560
See? He admitted it!
- He took away everything!

1496
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:23,348
One minute, one minute

1497
02:07:23,349 --> 02:07:25,387
You've amassed a lot of wealth

1498
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:28,384
So what have you got to lose?

1499
02:07:28,385 --> 02:07:31,340
Bloody moron!
Don't talk back at me!

1500
02:07:31,341 --> 02:07:36,586
From your wealth, I want my share.
250 million

1501
02:07:37,002 --> 02:07:40,373
250 million? Can you even
count upto 250 million?

1502
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:44,160
When Shera makes an
extortion demand...

1503
02:07:44,161 --> 02:07:47,365
like a falcon, he
flies away with it

1504
02:07:47,366 --> 02:07:49,489
Now listen to my theory

1505
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:53,818
The water I bathe in, I don't let it
flow into the gutters

1506
02:07:54,485 --> 02:07:58,272
I boil it and drink it up.
I serve it to my guests

1507
02:07:58,689 --> 02:08:01,769
When a man doesn't throw away
the water he bathes in...

1508
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:05,681
you think he'll give you 250 million
for nothing? Is it up for grabs?

1509
02:08:05,682 --> 02:08:08,762
Not just you. Even your
father will give it to me

1510
02:08:17,336 --> 02:08:21,623
Who's Raj Saxena?

1511
02:08:21,624 --> 02:08:24,995
I've stopped taking deposits and
lending the money on interest

1512
02:08:24,996 --> 02:08:29,990
We've come to collect money,
not to pay it

1513
02:08:29,991 --> 02:08:32,320
To collect?
- Yes

1514
02:08:32,321 --> 02:08:34,444
From me?
- Yes

1515
02:08:34,445 --> 02:08:37,650
And who could you be?
- You want to know who I am?

1516
02:08:37,983 --> 02:08:41,603
Bloody pigeon! I'll tell you

1517
02:08:41,604 --> 02:08:44,726
I called you moments ago,
didn't I?

1518
02:08:44,727 --> 02:08:47,806
I see! So you're the one
who wanted 250 million?

1519
02:08:48,347 --> 02:08:52,260
I'm everyone's father.
Shera's here for his share

1520
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:57,963
250 million. In cash.
- Forget 250 million in cash...

1521
02:08:58,379 --> 02:09:02,957
I wouldn't give you 250 blank
papers either

1522
02:09:02,958 --> 02:09:06,204
Sonofagun! You don't know
who I am

1523
02:09:06,663 --> 02:09:09,742
I'll hack you into small pieces
and throw it in the sea!

1524
02:09:10,534 --> 02:09:13,321
Listen...

1525
02:09:13,322 --> 02:09:16,443
they appear to be very dangerous.
Give them whatever they want

1526
02:09:16,444 --> 02:09:19,107
Really? Did you bring the cash
in dowry?

1527
02:09:19,108 --> 02:09:22,563
Dog! Looks like you don't
love your life

1528
02:09:23,312 --> 02:09:28,224
I do love money. More than my life.
So I keep chasing it all the while

1529
02:09:28,765 --> 02:09:31,761
Shera knows how to
recover his money

1530
02:09:31,762 --> 02:09:36,674
Take his wife away

1531
02:09:36,675 --> 02:09:39,337
Help! Save me!

1532
02:09:39,338 --> 02:09:42,334
Brother-in-law! You're just watching?
They're taking my sister away!

1533
02:09:42,335 --> 02:09:47,746
Let them take her away.
Good riddance!

1534
02:09:47,746 --> 02:09:52,408
Good riddance?

1535
02:09:56,529 --> 02:09:59,025
You're now in serious trouble

1536
02:09:59,026 --> 02:10:01,440
Forget the woman.
And take him along

1537
02:10:01,441 --> 02:10:05,604
Hey... why me? What are you
going to do with me...?

1538
02:10:06,311 --> 02:10:08,558
Where are you taking him...?
- To hell!

1539
02:10:08,559 --> 02:10:11,055
That's all right then. He has
a lot many relatives there

1540
02:10:11,056 --> 02:10:13,345
He's going to enjoy it.
Take him away!

1541
02:10:13,346 --> 02:10:16,342
Raj, some gangster called Shera
has kidnapped daddy

1542
02:10:16,343 --> 02:10:18,548
Wow! That's wonderful news!

1543
02:10:18,549 --> 02:10:21,337
You're thinking of jokes, Raj!
What if something happens to daddy?

1544
02:10:21,338 --> 02:10:24,375
Good thing too. A man like him
has no right to walk the earth

1545
02:10:24,376 --> 02:10:26,540
He has swindled people
of all their money

1546
02:10:26,541 --> 02:10:28,497
We've got to save daddy, Raj!

1547
02:10:28,498 --> 02:10:32,535
Shera has made a ransom demand
of 250 million

1548
02:10:33,034 --> 02:10:36,489
All right. Let me do something
for my future father-in-law

1549
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:40,651
What're you doing with so much rope...?
- You talk too much, silly fig!

1550
02:10:41,526 --> 02:10:44,606
You're a parcel of
Shera's currency notes

1551
02:10:44,607 --> 02:10:48,394
How come? If I were a parcel,
wouldn't I make money for myself?

1552
02:10:48,851 --> 02:10:52,431
Quiet! You've been talking
rubbish for a long time!

1553
02:10:52,432 --> 02:10:56,843
Anymore rubbish from you and I'll
take out life from your body...

1554
02:10:57,427 --> 02:11:00,631
like children deflate a balloon!
- Take what you want

1555
02:11:01,047 --> 02:11:04,462
Even puncture me. But don't take
any money from my pockets

1556
02:11:04,877 --> 02:11:08,373
Because I've always taken money.
I've never given it

1557
02:11:08,374 --> 02:11:11,454
I know you won't part with the money
so easily

1558
02:11:11,455 --> 02:11:16,490
Shera has made
other arrangements

1559
02:11:16,491 --> 02:11:19,653
Where's Shera's money?
- We've got your share, Shera-bhai

1560
02:11:19,654 --> 02:11:22,983
I'm a man of honour.
Step out and take a look

1561
02:11:22,984 --> 02:11:26,189
I'm sitting in the car and the van
behind me carries your 250 million

1562
02:11:26,855 --> 02:11:30,561
It's here. The dough!

1563
02:11:31,309 --> 02:11:37,220
What dough...? What dough?

1564
02:11:43,423 --> 02:11:46,545
So you've come to save the life
of your future father-in-law?

1565
02:11:47,085 --> 02:11:50,746
Yes, Shera-bhai. I've brought your
share... in a van actually

1566
02:11:50,747 --> 02:11:53,453
Go and get the money, guys

1567
02:11:53,454 --> 02:11:56,117
Go and unload it

1568
02:11:56,118 --> 02:11:58,532
Does your father-in-law suffer from
a disease of talking too much?

1569
02:11:58,533 --> 02:12:02,569
Yes, he's driven me nuts too.
He's a regular chatter-box

1570
02:12:03,277 --> 02:12:06,607
Here it is.
- So many gunny bags? What is it?

1571
02:12:07,273 --> 02:12:09,978
I brought the money in loose change.
- Rotten fig!

1572
02:12:09,979 --> 02:12:12,351
You think I'm going to count
the loose change?

1573
02:12:12,352 --> 02:12:15,598
Shera-bhai, you know what
a scoundrel my pa-in-law is

1574
02:12:16,264 --> 02:12:19,386
He was afraid it would get stolen.
So he got it converted into change

1575
02:12:19,387 --> 02:12:22,549
If someone came to steal, he'd need
no less than a dozen men

1576
02:12:23,299 --> 02:12:26,752
The men wouldn't come and
the money wouldn't go away. Simple

1577
02:12:26,753 --> 02:12:30,582
But who's going to count that?
- You have so many men

1578
02:12:30,999 --> 02:12:34,037
Hurry up

1579
02:12:34,038 --> 02:12:39,199
Unload it. Go on

1580
02:12:46,068 --> 02:12:49,190
Bring that parcel of money here.
- Sure, I'll be on my way

1581
02:12:51,063 --> 02:12:54,351
Time for you to make a move.
C'mon

1582
02:12:54,352 --> 02:12:56,390
How will I move?
Set me free

1583
02:12:56,391 --> 02:12:58,513
Oh yes, I'll free you

1584
02:12:58,513 --> 02:13:00,053
Lack of it...?
- What?

1585
02:13:00,054 --> 02:13:05,796
Nothing... brains

1586
02:13:05,797 --> 02:13:09,170
This ship, this ship
and this one...

1587
02:13:09,627 --> 02:13:13,748
ought to be dismantled in 10 days.
An investment of 10 million Dollars

1588
02:13:14,373 --> 02:13:17,369
You've come all the way from London
only to break up the ships, sir?

1589
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:20,325
There's a lot of money to be made.
We'll discuss that later

1590
02:13:20,326 --> 02:13:26,319
Is there a toilet nearby?
- Take a right from there, sir

1591
02:13:29,648 --> 02:13:34,145
Where's my brother-in-law. Dude?
- The name isn't dude...

1592
02:13:34,643 --> 02:13:38,848
they call me Qutub Minar.
- Whatever minar you are...

1593
02:13:40,014 --> 02:13:43,676
I told you to find my brother-in-law.
So where is he?

1594
02:13:44,633 --> 02:13:49,587
Your brother-in-law's been
hopping around like a frog...

1595
02:13:51,626 --> 02:13:57,788
Hey! There's your brother-in-law!
Those guys are dragging him away

1596
02:13:58,536 --> 02:14:05,030
God Almighty! My brother-in-law
in this state?

1597
02:14:09,318 --> 02:14:14,646
Where do you think you're going?

1598
02:14:16,643 --> 02:14:21,637
Where has he gone...?

1599
02:14:21,638 --> 02:14:27,050
Over there! The scoundrel!

1600
02:14:28,299 --> 02:14:30,337
Where do you think you're going?
- Yes?

1601
02:14:30,338 --> 02:14:33,501
Where were you running away to?
- No running. I'm going to the toilet

1602
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:36,373
What's that?
- You don't know what a toilet is?

1603
02:14:36,374 --> 02:14:41,410
Let go of my hands

1604
02:14:45,447 --> 02:14:49,526
Get him!

1605
02:14:49,527 --> 02:14:52,732
Where are you going...?
- I'm not running away

1606
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,769
I badly want to pee.
- You're lying!

1607
02:14:56,770 --> 02:14:59,892
I want to pee, I swear.
- You want to pee, eh?

1608
02:15:01,266 --> 02:15:05,636
C'mon

1609
02:15:09,590 --> 02:15:12,921
Go on inside and come back soon.
- Don't take too long

1610
02:15:13,378 --> 02:15:19,331
I'll come back if you let me go.
- All right, go on

1611
02:15:20,996 --> 02:15:25,201
Where has my brother-in-law gone?
Where...?

1612
02:15:35,397 --> 02:15:41,017
We're taking you away now.
- We're not letting you go!

1613
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:59,166
I forgot, I forgot

1614
02:16:02,704 --> 02:16:06,699
Over there!

1615
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:08,239
Brother-in-law!

1616
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:12,652
Gotcha!

1617
02:16:13,735 --> 02:16:17,148
So you come chasing me from London?
I'm not your brother-in-law!

1618
02:16:17,689 --> 02:16:22,267
You are too! Wherever you go,
I will follow you

1619
02:16:22,268 --> 02:16:26,680
Why've you gagged him?
- He was cursing us in English

1620
02:16:27,304 --> 02:16:30,301
English? My father-in-law
has never been to school

1621
02:16:30,301 --> 02:16:32,965
How did he pick up English?
Take that gag off

1622
02:16:32,966 --> 02:16:37,376
Take it off

1623
02:16:37,377 --> 02:16:42,039
See...? See?

1624
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:45,326
One moment...
- What's he saying?

1625
02:16:45,327 --> 02:16:48,033
A third-rate father-in-law using
such high-class English expletives?

1626
02:16:48,034 --> 02:16:51,821
Have you been training him
in English speaking?

1627
02:16:51,822 --> 02:16:54,152
I'm taking you to my sister today!
- No way

1628
02:16:54,153 --> 02:16:58,356
I'll explain. I came to India
to buy ships

1629
02:17:01,311 --> 02:17:04,642
The 250 million is gone. Where will
you buy a ship from, pa-in-law?

1630
02:17:05,307 --> 02:17:07,555
Pa-in-law...? One minute

1631
02:17:07,556 --> 02:17:13,466
I haven't a son or a daughter.
So how do I become your pa-in-law?

1632
02:17:14,008 --> 02:17:16,421
Have you forgotten about Kiran and me?
- Kiran...?

1633
02:17:16,422 --> 02:17:19,627
My name is Kiran Kumar. Where did
the other Kiran spring from?

1634
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:23,706
Looks like news of 250 million
has made you lose your marbles

1635
02:17:23,707 --> 02:17:25,662
Lost my marbles? Oh no

1636
02:17:25,663 --> 02:17:28,325
When I arrive, people say,
"The rich man has arrived"

1637
02:17:28,326 --> 02:17:31,322
Look at your wedding photos.
You're standing with my sister...

1638
02:17:31,323 --> 02:17:34,945
Iooking so handsome!
My darling brother-in-law

1639
02:17:34,946 --> 02:17:36,526
Hey watermelon!

1640
02:17:36,527 --> 02:17:39,816
Until that loose change is counted,
you are not leaving this place

1641
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:44,602
That change? Lt'll take 25 years
to count it!

1642
02:17:45,351 --> 02:17:49,263
You'll grow old! I've got a flight
to take to London tonight

1643
02:17:49,681 --> 02:17:53,342
Why must you go to London, Pa-in-law?
Kiran and I are right here. In India

1644
02:17:53,343 --> 02:17:56,422
How often have I told you
that I'm not your pa-in-law!

1645
02:17:56,423 --> 02:17:58,379
Your father-in-law...
- You are!

1646
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:00,377
Your father-in-law...
- You are!

1647
02:18:00,378 --> 02:18:03,332
- Yes...? - You are.
- I'm not!

1648
02:18:03,333 --> 02:18:06,746
Shera-bhai wants us illiterate guys
to keep a count!

1649
02:18:06,747 --> 02:18:11,658
Open the other bag

1650
02:18:11,659 --> 02:18:16,071
Charcoal?

1651
02:18:18,401 --> 02:18:21,564
Charcoal! Give it to me!

1652
02:18:21,565 --> 02:18:24,854
Bhai... look at this!
- What is it?

1653
02:18:25,728 --> 02:18:29,849
There's charcoal instead of money.
Look at this

1654
02:18:37,716 --> 02:18:40,420
What's all that...?
- Charcoal

1655
02:18:40,421 --> 02:18:43,834
Charcoal! Shera's not
sparing the two of you!

1656
02:18:44,375 --> 02:18:47,371
Shera-bhai...

1657
02:18:47,372 --> 02:18:50,869
you've preyed enough on humans
and their wealth

1658
02:18:52,035 --> 02:18:55,239
I have today incapacitated Shera
from using his claws

1659
02:18:56,363 --> 02:18:59,359
No lion can prey
without his claws

1660
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:02,482
Like you can't use a gun
without any bullets

1661
02:19:02,483 --> 02:19:06,352
What rubbish!

1662
02:19:06,353 --> 02:19:09,932
When did you do that?
- I'll tell you

1663
02:19:09,933 --> 02:19:12,722
When you guys were counting
the change...

1664
02:19:12,723 --> 02:19:17,884
I took out all the slugs

1665
02:19:18,341 --> 02:19:23,086
You have betrayed us!

1666
02:19:23,087 --> 02:19:28,083
Charcoal instead of money!

1667
02:20:21,945 --> 02:20:26,857
Kiran, my child...

1668
02:20:28,313 --> 02:20:33,892
Are you okay, daddy?
- Daddy?

1669
02:20:34,391 --> 02:20:37,387
I've been hired.
- I'm sorry

1670
02:20:37,388 --> 02:20:40,717
When she's my daughter, how can
I be your brother-in-law?

1671
02:20:41,425 --> 02:20:43,422
One moment!

1672
02:20:43,423 --> 02:20:46,669
Raj has gone inside to Shera
to rescue you

1673
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:52,372
But if you are here,
who's the one in there?

1674
02:20:52,705 --> 02:20:57,909
Ram's here, Shyam's over there

1675
02:22:49,338 --> 02:22:54,083
Yes, I cheated you!

1676
02:22:54,084 --> 02:22:57,788
I cheated you

1677
02:22:57,789 --> 02:23:02,949
I'm a smartass, all right

1678
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:08,236
I'm going to wrap you
in a shroud

1679
02:23:08,278 --> 02:23:13,356
Let my brother go!

1680
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:20,516
You want 250 million...? You ought
to be kicked 250 million times!

1681
02:23:26,301 --> 02:23:29,881
You're the root of
all the problem, Saxena

1682
02:23:29,881 --> 02:23:33,753
You're not escaping today!
Not today, you old man!

1683
02:24:01,558 --> 02:24:04,929
Come, Inspector

1684
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:10,341
The police show up in the end

1685
02:24:11,423 --> 02:24:16,751
Get them all!

1686
02:24:17,001 --> 02:24:20,288
Hey miser, I'll come again to
collect the extortion money

1687
02:24:20,289 --> 02:24:21,870
I'll surely come

1688
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:26,158
You risked your life
to save mine, son?

1689
02:24:27,657 --> 02:24:29,862
Although you're in love
with money...

1690
02:24:29,863 --> 02:24:32,443
the life of Kiran's father
is dear to me

1691
02:24:32,444 --> 02:24:36,607
If you must love something,
love humanity, not wealth

1692
02:24:37,813 --> 02:24:41,059
That's the real wealth

1693
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:44,182
Well said, my son. At such
a young age...

1694
02:24:44,724 --> 02:24:48,719
you've transformed an
elderly man like me

1695
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:53,338
You could say that blood has washed
away the filth in my heart

1696
02:24:53,339 --> 02:24:56,462
I've had a change of heart.
I'm a changed man, son

1697
02:24:56,878 --> 02:24:59,499
I've changed too

1698
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,581
I've decided to turn a new leaf.
I used to run away from my wife...

1699
02:25:02,997 --> 02:25:06,452
and my brother-in-law. But I've
decided, not anymore

1700
02:25:06,909 --> 02:25:11,320
I'm going back to London
with my brother-in-law

1701
02:25:11,321 --> 02:25:16,649
Hey mister... you've got
two brothers-in-law, not one

1702
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:19,312
So I want double the payment now.
Okay?

1703
02:25:19,313 --> 02:25:24,766
Double the payment?
