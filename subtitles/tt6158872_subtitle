1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,034
FF

2
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,374
When numerous bits of clouds

3
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,406
Gather up in a sky

4
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,479
We call it the 'monsoon'

5
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,114
And when numerous words gather up

6
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,610
We call it a 'novel'

7
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,710
A love triangle leading to a
murder, not new in the city.

8
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:16,414
Police suspects, Gagan Sirdar's murder
is due to an illicit love affair.

9
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:21,644
Documents say Suranjana and Monosheej
have been married for about ten years

10
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,907
This neighbourhood is well aware
of Gagan's affair with Suranjana;

11
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:29,603
wife of Monoshij from
the Mitra family.

12
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,441
Suranjana and Gagan met each
other on a social networking site.

13
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,171
They were involved after
that for about two years.

14
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,043
The TV has become
impossible these days.

15
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
All they have is rape,
murder, blasts and...

16
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,909
riots.

17
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,743
Who'll watch religious or comedy
shows in the morning?

18
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,107
Crime sells

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,201
Bloody...

20
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,677
perverted mentality.

21
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:55,539
Psychologists say Mr. Monoshij has
a borderline personality disorder.

22
00:03:55,633 --> 00:04:00,207
Possible But no one ever complained of
any disputes in the family due to that.

23
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,007
There is an aggressor
in every animal.

24
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,137
So, murders and rapes
intrigue people

25
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,945
Sorry. I don't buy that.

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,674
No one will read the paper
if they don't serve scandals.

27
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Exactly.
What's illicit is delicious!

28
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,712
Dr. Jekyll is bland but
Mr. Hyde, is spicy!

29
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,511
Which is also why novels
by Edgar Allan Poe,

30
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,877
Herman Melville or Nirbed Lahiri
are your favourites

31
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,170
Dark.

32
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,911
Gritty.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,374
Cynical.

34
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:35,239
Opportunity, courage and power;

35
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,247
can turn Angel into Devil and
Devil into Angel.

36
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:45,275
Although, who the history
chooses to call an Angel or a Devil,

37
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,312
that's relative

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,071
Another Virgin Mary for
me For you?

39
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,271
Nothing-
- Thank you.

40
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,209
Okay, Sir.

41
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:23,214
Passing out in 11 months,
campus interview is done,

42
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,268
what is scaring you?

43
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,435
Can't speak to the
parents about living in?

44
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,741
Let me get a job,
stand on my own feet.

45
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,802
You can't even stand on
your feet with stilts!

46
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,305
Coward-
- Great!

47
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:36,679
Yet, I'm the one urging you to make
use of the five day off for a trip!

48
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,508
Relax!
<i>I'll</i> speak to them.

49
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,014
We're a conservative
family, you see

50
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,771
I agree, Rishabh is a nice boy.-
- Not at all!

51
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,810
He's very naughty!

52
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:24,849
But spending three nights
together before marriage...-

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,006
- Aunty, do people get
adventurous only at night?

54
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,541
Aunty, just three days at
my Phool Aunt's house

55
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,078
A five hour journey.
To Murshidabad.

56
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,577
Obviously they'll visit the
Hazarduari Palace in the daytime

57
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,442
Aware of Hazarduari's history?

58
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,637
Nawab Humayun Jah's-
- Please!

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,374
I'm worrying about the nights, where
does Nawab Humayun feature?

60
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,580
Phool Aunt?-
- I made it up!

61
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,575
Baby!

62
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,074
Weekend is on!

63
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,180
Ma is convinced.
We're going to Koelphuli!

64
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,079
Drive carefully.

65
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,013
I don't want any scratches

66
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:44,012
'Without those, the car
can't lose its virginity.

67
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:47,048
Girlfriend and alcohol
on the beach...

68
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,510
That too in my car.

69
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,711
Get yourself someone.
Go for a trip.

70
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,513
I deal with scrap iron, brother.

71
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,610
The beach is not my thing.

72
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,676
I'd rather to go Gaya

73
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,675
Are you planning a
honeymoon or a funeral?

74
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,778
Both.

75
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,041
It'll be cost effective.

76
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,807
Yes tell me.

77
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,871
Another peg?

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,606
Shut up!-
- You're only four pegs down.

79
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,145
Rishabh, are you drinking?-
- No!

80
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,973
Can't go even one
day without it?

81
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,307
I haven't drank!

82
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,442
She smelt it over phone!

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,879
How was that, huh?

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,105
Three cheers

85
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,648
For a happy weekend

86
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,513
I think it's nice.-
- Hmm.

87
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,107
Hello, young man!
Avinash Sikdar here

88
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:30,735
Bodyguard.-
- As in?

89
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,437
Taking care of the
health is my job

90
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,578
Here's my card.

91
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:35,609
Wife?

92
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,678
No... yes!

93
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,942
Which one?-
- The only one I have!

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,447
Oh no! I'm asking about
your room Room number!

95
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,706
312.

96
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,944
Mine is 316. Opposite yours

97
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:47,804
Honeymoon?

98
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,970
Yes

99
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,368
Mosquito net is a must.

100
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,913
The mosquitoes here don't bite,
they ﬂy you away. Like a hijack!

101
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,040
Hi, Jack!

102
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,475
The wet hair carries the
smell of a waterfall.

103
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,075
Even a mother's hair has that.

104
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:18,107
Your own wife,
or someone else's.

105
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,608
All of them have it.

106
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,938
My daughter's hair had it too.

107
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,013
A jungle of waterfall!

108
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,438
Like the Victoria falls!

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,906
Yes Ma. We just reached
Phool Aunt's house from Hazarduari.

110
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,971
Have you eaten?

111
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,172
Yes. Brilliant service

112
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,571
'Service'? Speak to your
father. Spoilt brat.

113
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:48,679
Saw Hazarduari? How is it?-
- Yes, very nice!

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
Read the chief architect's name?-
- Chief architect?

115
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,444
Sir Thomas Roe?-
- What!

116
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,274
MacLeod Duncan.

117
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,811
Bapi, <i>I'll</i> have to go now, please!

118
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,176
That was an oral examination!

119
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:04,180
What are you laughing at?-
- So, miss Goody two shoes!

120
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,507
Come in!-
- There's news! Oh no!

121
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,938
There's a good news

122
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:13,478
I caught some nice
Pompfret fish, want to try?

123
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,405
Such a boring man!
Sitting in the room all day!

124
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:21,214
Go walk on the beach
bare feet in the mornings!

125
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,008
It'll feel like acupuncture!-
- Baba, let's go.

126
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,838
You're worthless!

127
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,469
Let's make out on the beach!

128
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,510
And what if someone
sees us?

129
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:10,342
Wow! So romantic!-
- What?

130
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,146
How about spending a
night in that bungalow?

131
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,974
Seems like a haunted house.

I say, where there is passion

The sun is setting.

137
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,977
Is that why you
brought me here?

138
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,202
As in?

139
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:42,074
You could've brought your Kingshuk da
here and drank together!

140
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,136
Hey, come on,
don't spoil the evening!

141
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,337
'Spoil the evening'?

142
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,738
Are you turning into an
alcoholic, Rishabh?

143
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,544
Is that what you think?

144
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,938
Haven't seen anyone drink
like this in my family.

145
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,304
So?-
- So? Even my father drinks!

146
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,077
But twice a month!-
- On full-moon and no-moon.

147
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:01,771
Don't you make fun of
my dad, Rishabh!

148
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,844
Shohag, your Babi is
not the fucking world!

149
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,570
To me he is!

150
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,110
You drank beer and smoked up
on the way! And now, wine!

151
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,109
You've spoilt my mood!

152
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,512
You lost your parents early! How
would you know such etiquette, right?

153
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:16,341
Wham!

154
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:17,810
You're not drinking any more!

155
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,573
I bloody well will!
Why do you care!

156
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,737
You are not drinking!-
- You're so bloody nagging!

157
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,039
I'm nagging?

158
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,072
Crap!

159
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,477
Get rid of me!
Find someone else then!

160
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,341
Why are you disturbing
me? Just get lost!

161
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,402
Stop being such a stupid drunkard!

162
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:32,943
You're an ass!

163
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,903
You're an ass!

164
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,341
Hey, Shohag, listen!

165
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,145
Fucking housewife!
Middle-class...

166
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,102
Feel like weeping?

167
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,337
Sad?

168
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,944
Happens

169
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,508
Who are you?

170
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:41,142
Each drop of your tear,
is writing a letter.

171
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,506
Like every dewdrop does
in the moonlight.

172
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,479
'What rubbish! 'Who are
you! 'What's all this!

173
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,672
Do your parents know
you're here?

174
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,771
Why do you care?
I live or I die. Who cares?

175
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,706
The same aggression!

176
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:09,273
A murder gives birth to
two murderers.

177
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,804
The murderer himself.
And the other one who,

178
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,607
lives on to avenge.

179
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,712
Anger is eating up the planet.

180
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,373
Come in.

181
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:16,077
I will be dead in a few days.

182
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,307
Don't want my name in papers for
murdering, raping or eloping you

183
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:29,075
Although, any man would
intend to devour you.

184
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,511
Sexy legs.

185
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:37,244
You live here alone?

186
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,713
Everybody lives alone.

187
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,673
They just pretend to be together.

188
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,644
My name is Shohag.

189
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,346
Sit.

190
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,214
Your friend will be here soon

191
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,340
Let's go to the room

192
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,813
What? Let's go!

193
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,542
'What the hell are you doing
in this bloody bungalow, Shohag?

194
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,975
Shohag, we need to talk!

195
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,979
Love is very tender.

196
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,077
Don't scold the one you caress.

197
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,406
And who the hell are you?

198
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,102
Angry Young man.

199
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,676
Humans need to calm down

200
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,870
Whisky?

201
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,308
I don't really know you...-
- How long would that take?

202
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,776
Anything for you, beautiful?

203
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,572
Let's drink to our friendship

204
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,412
That's the root to all the problem!

205
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,808
Dhrubo Lahiri.

206
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,840
An old resident of Koelphuli.

207
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm Rishabh Chakrabarty.

208
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,706
Just finished my
Master Degree course

209
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,345
'Rishabh'.

210
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,440
Rishabh Chakrabarty.

211
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:31,048
'Rishabh' is the second musical note.
So are you natural or pure?

212
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,874
As in, water... soda...

213
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,644
or on the rocks?

214
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,144
Ice and water.

215
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,670
You had to drink?-
- What could I do?

216
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,212
An elderly person offered.-
- Oh!

217
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,842
One Blue Lagoon for me
in that case.

218
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,707
I never lacked money.

219
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm busy with my writing here.

220
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,177
I feel 'Dhrubo' is a
name you made up.

221
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,177
Dine with me tonight.

222
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,441
What about some...

223
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,536
teppanyaki?

224
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,673
'A murder gives birth to
two murderers'

225
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:36,703
I followed you here because
you quoted this line.

226
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,379
The novel's name?-
- 'The Moon On Sale'.

227
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,104
You've read it?-
- So many times!

228
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,608
In fact it is my
favourite novel.

229
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,948
I have all of Nirbed
Lahiri's work

230
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,410
Heard they're making a
film on 'The Moon on Sale'.

231
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:55,710
Phoenix Films has bought the rights
Srijita Sen gave it

232
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,906
'Sen'.

233
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,541
What are you thinking?

234
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,570
I am thinking...

235
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:20,914
I still have young and beautiful
female readers like you.

236
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:24,905
As in?

237
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,547
'Nirbed' is my pen name

238
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,671
My real name is 'Dhrubo'.

239
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,406
So this pouch has an
'N' on it. Though,

240
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,644
now everyone calls me
'Nirbed'.

241
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,973
Do you even know what
you're saying?

242
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,569
The Japanese restaurant
chain, Mizono,

243
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,169
started this cooking
system Teppanyaki.

244
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,140
You mean to say...

245
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,813
you are Nirbed Lahiri, from
the newspaper, 'Drishtikon'?

246
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,141
Who suddenly disappeared,

247
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:54,146
after receiving immense
recognition?

248
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,703
There's only one famous Nirbed Lahiri.

249
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,507
Nirbed da, did you proof-read it?

250
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,747
What is the point?-
- No, you see,

251
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,074
they invent their own
grammar and spelling.

252
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,511
What did I write?-
- 'Ritu'.

253
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,747
But you've written a
different spelling.

254
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,238
Then how did you know
I've written, 'Ritu'?

255
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,076
She figured than.-
- Figuring it out is the thing

256
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,908
The understanding of it.
The communication.

257
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,446
<i>Not the grammar.</i>

258
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,571
How long?
Around twenty years!

259
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,807
That is why I was wondering
why you look so familiar!

260
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,311
I've seen your photos. Read
your work. In the papers.

261
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:35,146
Could I touch you once,
Nirbed da?

262
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:36,873
Those are my lines

263
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,377
I always say it to
gainly women

264
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,047
The question is, how deep
shall you touch me.

265
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,970
No one can even imagine that
you're alive.

266
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,573
Obviously.

267
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,340
You must've been four
when I left the city.

268
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,509
I wasn't old enough to
remember that time

269
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:58,979
Your work has been translated into
four other langugages you know?

270
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,279
I had left by then.-
- Why?

271
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:12,845
So I could cook
teppanyaki for you!

272
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,877
But why did you run away
from the city?

273
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,240
What do you think?

274
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:24,541
I think all authors have
an expiry date.

275
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,670
You were getting exhausted.

276
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:37,473
A novel has been tormenting
me for the past twenty years

277
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:44,479
I plan to finish the work everyday.

278
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,675
But I cannot seem to find
an end.

279
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,541
It is based on me.

280
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,480
Can I see the manuscript?

281
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,140
<i>I'll</i> show you.

282
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,045
Here we are!

283
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,541
Yakisoba!

284
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,503
Wow!

285
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,875
I was the assistant editor
of 'Drishtikon' back then

286
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:21,780
I used to take care of the
poetry section primarily.

287
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:21,999
Hey Nirbed, read my article on
Charles and Diana's marriage?

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,379
Hey Nirbed, read my article on
Charles and Diana's marriage?

289
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,005
I did. It seemed as if,

290
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,847
you played the priest.-
- What!

291
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:36,109
You're exactly as old as the number
of teeth you have Come on...

292
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,271
Nirbed...-
- Yes?

293
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,971
Speak to Sir.

294
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,108
He's transferring you to
North Bengal.

295
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,770
I heard rumors in the morning.

296
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,005
Crap

297
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,978
May I come in?

298
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,177
Sol am being exported
to North Bengal?

299
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,308
Why don't you send
Mr. Nikhil?

300
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,277
Is 'Man' and 'Mango'
the same thing?

301
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,938
If they'd sent me to the
moon instead of Armstrong..-

302
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,375
- Oh you would've.

303
00:23:57,433 --> 00:24:00,642
You would've easily sold a few
copies of Drishtikon even there.

304
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,643
Probably.

305
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,474
The novel was born on...

306
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,506
12th of July.

307
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:17,645
My wife turned
thirty-two that day.

308
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,203
Birthday gift!

309
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:28,470
I hear you're going
to North Bengal?

310
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,875
Who told you?

311
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,810
No.
Took care of that.

312
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,005
All of a sudden?

313
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:37,014
Have to be in the family
album all the time, you see

314
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,337
Now hurry!
They'll be here soon.

315
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,411
Open the wine.

316
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:45,040
The day I fell in love
for the very first time

317
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,482
A small get-together had been
arranged at my place that day.

318
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,943
As usual, I was the
bartender:

319
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,672
Intellectual circle?-
- Not at all.

320
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,471
Srijita's friends

321
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:13,146
I knew some of them And some, I
met on that day for the first time.

322
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,338
Though, they knew me...

323
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,443
from the paper.

324
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,544
The evening was going fine.

325
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,441
The conversations were
pacing up and down

326
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,910
Suddenly,

327
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,137
a waterfall ﬂooded the room

328
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,273
What's this!

329
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,745
Called you so many times!
Why'd you get lame?

330
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,643
Why, due to
her highness!

331
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,340
She spent all the evening
solving crossword puzzles

332
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,138
Happy birthdays.
' Thank you!

333
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,202
Happy birthday!-
- Thanks!

334
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:55,138
Why didn't you get Antu?-
- Left him at his uncle's.

335
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:01,874
Alokesh, our college friend.-
- Yes! Immensely talented.

336
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:03,435
World famous in the college!

337
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:07,969
And Antara, his wife.

338
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,476
She's never come here.

339
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:13,707
Sree, I, Alokesh and Madhusree.
They used to call us

340
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:16,438
'The mischievous four!', in college

341
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,277
Welcome.

342
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,278
I am..-
- I know you.

343
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,007
I've always known you.

344
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,341
Yes a nice Godman's
photograph over there.

345
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,509
That would be enough.

346
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,880
God knows why people do up
their homes with ghastly masks.

347
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:36,412
Why are you speaking crap?
That's an African Makonde

348
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,740
But I'd definitely be scared
if I woke up to it.

349
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,245
Weird face it is!-
- See, Bishakha,

350
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,107
You collect curios.
Impresario and all.

351
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,773
But to us Africa
symbolizes animals primarily.

352
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,607
Right, Mr. Alokesh?-
- Absolutely!

353
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,375
See, I'm a share broker.
I live off selling shares

354
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,481
The Sensex is after all at
the mercy of God.

355
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,511
Hey! Neruda!
La barcarola!

356
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,738
Sree, I'm taking this!

357
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,043
I love you as certain dark
things are to be loved.

358
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,841
Ask him-
- Read Neruda, Mr. Alokesh?

359
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:08,112
N o.

360
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,873
Who's he?-
- Neruda is very sensitive

361
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,881
How about 'Nerada' from our
locality? Writes pretty well too!

362
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,505
<i>See, whether it
be Neruda or Nevada,</i>

363
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,613
nothing is more sensitive
than the Sensex

364
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,907
Tell me if you are hungry.

365
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:43,305
Come on, go eat.-
- Come to my room.

366
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,314
Where's everyone else?-
- In the study.

367
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,480
Checking out your
collection of books.

368
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,945
Do you like playing
with words?

369
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,705
Why?

370
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:10,279
Crossword puzzle?

371
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,044
I used to like it.
These days it's different.

372
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,076
Anything new you're
working on?

373
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,780
Nothing in particular:

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,446
A few essays.

375
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,942
Last year's novel in Drishtikon..

376
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,008
Wasn't so nice

377
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,339
Is it?

378
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,041
Only playing with words

379
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,144
So tell me a few stories.

380
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,310
I'm not being able
to crack anything.

381
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,008
Stories?

382
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:47,080
Continue the rest of it
at the dinner table

383
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,373
Okay.

384
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,635
If I must.

385
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,941
Hey, another piece?

386
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:01,346
Do you think I am kidding?
Give me a nice piece

387
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,941
It's been long!

388
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,439
Another one?-
- No!

389
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,140
Less of a Bhekti,
more of a 'Whale!

390
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,443
Any plan between 25th to
29th? It's a long leave

391
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,501
Is it?

392
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:14,840
Nothing much.

393
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,479
Let's do the Palamau forests then?

394
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,806
I just found a nice
bungalow over there

395
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,505
Hey, let's go then?

396
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:22,142
Let's see.

397
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,271
We'll go by car then.-
<i>- I'll</i> handle the catering service

398
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:28,004
Vodka with cauliﬂower
chops! Brilliant!

399
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,003
It'll be great!

400
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,940
Twenty miles from Daltongunj.

401
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,904
Beside river Auranga-
- Correct!

402
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,947
Let's go then!
It'll be great!

403
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,981
I've been there There are
two Santhal forts nearby.

404
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:42,077
Santhal forts?

405
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,904
They belong to the Chero tribe.

406
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,102
They had fought the Mughals

407
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,113
Maharaja Medini Ray.-
- Holy cow!

408
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,337
You're so knowledgeable!

409
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,945
I feel like kissing you
right away!

410
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,804
These writings are worthless

411
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,375
Trash!

412
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,409
The Press is saying
'Father of self-destruction'.

413
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,604
Dark romantic!

414
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,043
The bestseller rack,

415
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,477
doesn't say the truth.
You've to figure it out yourself.

416
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,340
Be it the storm the ﬂood, Aslesha (a
catastrophe), a tornado or the hurricane.

417
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,712
They can never be better
philanderers than me.

418
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,847
I rule 'creation' and 'stability', both.

419
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,713
I am 'destruction'.

420
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,277
Pain...
The darkness...

421
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,103
Devour me!

422
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,336
Make me a pan of you!

423
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:24,605
I too,

424
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,740
love playing with
words, Antara.

425
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,507
'Wound'

426
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,943
Could you think of
anything, Nirbed da?

427
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,704
Latin American country,

428
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,043
named after a vegetable,

429
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,145
spelled in two Bengali letters.

430
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,504
Chile!
- Chi?

431
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,373
Chi-le?

432
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,313
Good good!-
- Nirbed da..

433
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,937
The editor's note?

434
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,509
What's the point of
writing it?

435
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:01,039
How about writing a comic
strip or the daily horoscope?

436
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,706
Because that's what
people read!

437
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,105
Deadline:

438
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:08,142
17th October.
Saturday.

439
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,813
You cross the line and
you're dead.

440
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:19,107
Someone from a little
magazine is here Go.

441
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,710
Nirbed, you have a call.

442
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,312
Busy?-
- No.

443
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,710
Didn't go to school?

444
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,412
Bunked it.

445
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,839
Listen, want to go
for a film?

446
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,736
'Casualties of War'?-
- No.

447
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,435
I can't stand bloodshed

448
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,377
Go for it. <i>I'll</i> see
you after the show.

449
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,139
6:30 pm.

450
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:44,309
Dr club.

451
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,241
Oh yes..

452
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,376
What is your magazine called?

453
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:51,644
'Jathor'(Womb).

454
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:16,279
We went shopping
Watched a film.

455
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,103
Brian De Palma film

456
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,568
How was it?

457
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,407
Sean Penn was brilliant.

458
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,577
Not the typical mashed potato
type. I don't like that kind.

459
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,240
I quite like that type, with spices.

460
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,210
Hey Srijita!

461
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,643
Oh, hi!

462
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,479
Sit, I'll be back.

463
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,771
So, could you win?

464
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,342
What?

465
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:51,411
In the word play?

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,741
N o.

467
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,377
You?

468
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,605
I win everyday.

469
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:06,207
Excuse me, if I am not wrong..

470
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,579
You are..-
- Nirbed Lahiri.

471
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,440
<i>Autograph please'?</i>

472
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:19,113
Thank you, Sir.

473
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,049
I too have an autograph
book, you know.

474
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,347
Is that so?

475
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:37,640
Very well. But in return

476
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,841
can we meet one day?

477
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,003
To play with words

478
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:49,707
He's here.

479
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:50,939
Right on time.

480
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:07,507
At your service

481
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,510
The share market isn't a big deal.
You buy and sell at the same go.

482
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,840
I forgot my sunglasses.

483
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,341
Go get it!-
- Lost another one?

484
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,345
She's high maintenance!

485
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,276
Go, get it.

486
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,342
It's quite late.
Let's stop here tonight

487
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:39,745
Yes

488
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,336
I'm quite sleepy as well.

489
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,140
Erm... how about an
autograph tomorrow?

490
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,674
We're having lunch
together tomorrow.

491
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,112
Teppanyaki again?

492
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,810
Quesadillas,
pure Mexican cuisine.

493
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,238
Thanks.-
- Goodnight!

494
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,808
Spoilsport.

495
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:06,410
You had to feel sleepy exactly
when the story was building up.

496
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,207
A Lecherous writer.

497
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:10,104
Missing from the city.

498
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,143
I mean, absconding from
the police too.

499
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,609
Cooking you delicacies
at an uncanny bungalow.

500
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,409
Telling you stories of his
illicit love affair.

501
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,840
Crazy loner.
Old fan.

502
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:23,914
His gaze itself is fishy.

503
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,641
I saw, I noticed...
he was looking at your...

504
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:32,448
Do you want everyone in
this world to go blind?

505
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,172
Don't be silly, Rishabh!

506
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,680
He had multiple
relationships in his life,

507
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,011
that does not
make him a letch.

508
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,843
Oh! So he is a lover?
Byron!

509
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,672
Okay! Now you're really
suffocating me!

510
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,509
Can I never mix with people
freely because of you?

511
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,671
So much in just a day!

512
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,778
Let's forget about Nirbed Lahiri.

513
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,310
Come close.

514
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:57,276
Let's make love?

515
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,241
I'm not in the mood.

516
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:02,614
I'm sleeping on the sofa.

517
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,574
Take it easy, you know?

518
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:15,973
Pushing through the crowd

519
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:19,579
Trudging ahead

520
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,408
Stumbling on the hitches

521
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,347
I stand still

522
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:30,674
All my savings

523
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,778
Get exhausted

524
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,244
But a colourful ribbon

525
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:40,543
Entangles itself

526
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,273
The same story
All over the world

527
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:49,179
Winter and Summer
All are futile

528
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:53,474
Oh Sea
Humble is my presence

529
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:57,310
Quaff me back into your blue

530
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:23,112
So, young man? Do you
have a body ache?

531
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:26,315
Weird mattresses they've got!

532
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,311
Sleeping on them is
like hell.

533
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,940
Sleep on a straw mat on the ﬂoor.
Take care of your back.

534
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,138
Sure.

535
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:34,804
Where's your wife?

536
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:37,944
She's coming Lame riser.-
- Don't allow it!

537
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,172
Look at my wife!

538
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:41,976
She's turned into a pillow
being a late riser.

539
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,512
What a figure she had!

540
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:47,007
'Will you shut up?-
- Speaking from experience,

541
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,670
have guava, Vitamin C.

542
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,539
May I?-
- Shiuli,

543
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,080
and our local bananas too.
For a handsome potty!

544
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,739
They prefer strawberries,
in this age of globalization

545
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,972
But not guavas.

546
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,707
So when did you get married?-
- Last March.

547
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,906
Must be a legal registry. The
ceremonies don't happen in spring

548
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,172
Behold!

549
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,837
Here she comes!

550
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,536
Hello!-
- Good morning!

551
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,442
Good morning!-
- Honey,

552
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:17,612
want a guava?

553
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,438
No, you have it.

554
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,878
We'll go take a dip in the sea-
- Wait a minute!

555
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:25,512
What now?

556
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:32,214
Sunscreen lotion is a must!

557
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:33,741
Thank you.

558
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:21,909
Bright.

559
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,937
Very bright.

560
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,247
Mexican food,
hope you remember?

561
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:35,604
Crock pot Chicken taco meat.

562
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,876
For the health conscious
ones this is...

563
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,776
the ideal recipe

564
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,704
Please?

565
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:59,044
It was the beginning
of the nineties

566
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,041
The age of STD, ISD, PCO.

567
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,040
Only one telephone in the locality.

568
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,780
Didi, phone

569
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,980
Hello.
Antara speaking.

570
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:21,213
Anyone else home or are
you alone?

571
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:24,609
No. Nobody.
Who's this?

572
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:28,508
I really feel like
seeing you, Antara

573
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,245
Haven't called to play with
words. Want to play with you.

574
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,942
Wham!

575
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,247
Who's this?-
- Hotel Haven Sheraton.

576
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,346
I'll wait.

577
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,435
Nirbed da?

578
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,408
You?
Drunk?

579
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,102
What is it?

580
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:36,678
What else would I
have done?

581
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:39,347
What else am I
capable of?

582
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:45,677
I have to tell you something.

583
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:49,448
You need to know this.

584
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,176
I got a phone call.

585
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,013
Our firm has
declared closure

586
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:08,646
I'm ruined, Antara!

587
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,279
It's over!

588
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,645
Babu had bought 2 lacs worth
shares of General Electricals.

589
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,237
180 rupees per share.

590
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:37,846
I had myself bought some.

591
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,877
On fifteen days' credit.

592
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:46,346
The company is doomed
with an excise case

593
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,746
Price has fallen to 30 rupees
per share. Babu has vanished.

594
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:03,749
And the owner has gotten
admitted in the hospital.

595
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,274
The firm has crashed too.

596
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:10,715
A small little job in the accounts!

597
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,144
I don't even have a degree...

598
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,970
nor contacts.

599
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:20,477
Nor a huge bank balance.

600
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:23,405
And I'm a father!

601
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:26,503
What do I do!

602
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:29,615
I don't know how
tomorrow will come to me!

603
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:33,646
I feel like hanging myself, Antara!

604
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,610
I thought I'd perfume my home,

605
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:44,839
from all the fragrance that
Antara's body could offer.

606
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,012
But unless they are unequal,

607
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,109
no two people submit to
each other.

608
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:55,378
So, no relationship takes birth.

609
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,100
No two people submit to
each other.

610
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,211
What's up?
Come inside.

611
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:03,075
Sit:

612
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,336
Please sit!

613
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,780
The editor's notation.

614
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:14,546
Ready?
That's great?

615
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:17,305
You're a savior Nirbed
da! You've earned a treat.

616
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,471
Treat?

617
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:23,879
How about you for a treat? You've
look very ripe these days!

618
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,174
She's a jug of poison.
Don't drink her. Hollow.

619
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,077
Deadline eh?

620
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:33,070
What is it?

621
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,644
What's with these dark
circles? Your face looks dry!

622
00:47:39,834 --> 00:47:42,815
Did Alokesh say something?

623
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:45,569
Speak up?

624
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,237
We love Alokesh a lot.

625
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:54,771
What is it?
Why are you crying?

626
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,806
What is it?

627
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:04,074
Tell me?

628
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,381
Say, 'Samachar Koumudi'
or Ram Mohan Roy.

629
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,940
Excuse me.

630
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:15,675
Bengal Gazette, first newspaper. <i>-
-</i> Right.

631
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,073
Nirbed da, call for you-
- Who is it?

632
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,945
Your wife

633
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:22,773
Yes hello?-
- Busy?

634
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,144
Antara is here.

635
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,971
We're coming
to your office.

636
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,474
Coming in,
are you free?

637
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,841
Yes.-
- Come.

638
00:48:46,734 --> 00:48:48,680
Sit.

639
00:48:52,134 --> 00:48:56,105
Antara told me everything.

640
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,577
What?

641
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,908
Alokesh lost his job
You must do something

642
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,543
Order for tea

643
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,273
You know a lot of people, so
I thought why not see you once?

644
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,006
If you could just...

645
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,502
Sorry.

646
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:25,745
I might be bothering you.

647
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,141
He is of no good to anyone

648
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:30,971
Sitting and writing poetry all day.

649
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:34,607
How old is he?

650
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:38,505
Srijita's college friend
Around 35 years Not my age

651
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:41,105
Can he work hard?

652
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:44,311
Yes, he can, Sir.-
- There's a lot of running around.

653
00:49:44,433 --> 00:49:46,208
Here, have an apple

654
00:49:46,267 --> 00:49:48,770
An apple a day keeps
the doctor away.

655
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:51,508
And what if the doctor
is a beautiful woman?

656
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:54,103
I should've expected that.

657
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,205
He will do the running around, Sir.
And he's a genuine guy!

658
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,637
Okay. Ghatak has been
telling me for a long time.

659
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,839
We need someone.

660
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:08,471
Some kind of cash assistant.

661
00:50:08,567 --> 00:50:11,013
Someone who can drop the cheques.

662
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,870
And to maintain the accounts.

663
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:16,204
But salary?

664
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:18,671
How much is he expecting?

665
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:25,379
All of a sudden, the
equation changed.

666
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,876
And you took advantage
of the situation

667
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:31,570
Who doesn't?

668
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:35,844
Truth is we're animals.

669
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,977
Likes wolves we can
smell our preys.

670
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:45,946
In that parched jungle
I could smell ﬂesh!

671
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:51,411
Just a minute,
hold on please.

672
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,135
Hello?

673
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,847
Yes, please connect me to 22891511.

674
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,346
Yes, dear, just a moment.
Hold on

675
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:00,542
Thanks.

676
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,208
Hello?

677
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:04,105
It's 2:30 right now.

678
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:05,905
I know you don't have a car.

679
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:07,540
Leave already.

680
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:11,581
You should reach Hotel
Haven Sheraton, by 3:15.

681
00:51:12,267 --> 00:51:13,678
<i>I'll</i> be waiting
at the lobby.

682
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,641
And Alokesh's job?

683
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,174
'Without that the relationship
would be stuck in word play; Antara.

684
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,109
You wouldn't come

685
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,904
I know you don't have a car.

686
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,975
No!

687
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,940
Chuck it.

688
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:49,514
What are we doing!

689
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,570
I don't do what...

690
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,046
People say.

691
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,777
What I w rite,

692
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:18,470
is what people do.

693
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,912
That too after
very many years

694
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,643
What would you have done,
if you were in my place?

695
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:39,039
At least I,

696
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:43,771
wouldn't munch peanuts
sitting at the lake side

697
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,238
My knees are going weak!

698
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:16,537
I can'! stand
on my feet any more!

699
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,939
We both broke someone's
faith respectively.

700
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,338
Blind faith must be broken.

701
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:54,308
Then why do
people make homes?

702
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,638
Convenience

703
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,143
Every home has an
expiry date.

704
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,370
Homes change.

705
00:55:10,134 --> 00:55:13,638
I love Srijita, Antara

706
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,705
Even today.

707
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,973
Truly.

708
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:26,970
But I want you.

709
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,670
That's also true.

710
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:25,345
That night, Antara..

711
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,871
Stayed up all night.

712
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,703
Guilt.

713
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:34,404
Alokesh had fallen asleep

714
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,104
They always fall asleep easily.-
- And you?

715
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,674
I couldn't sleep as well.

716
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,675
For every hunter, the first
kill is the most adventurous

717
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,212
Very different from
days of nothingness.

718
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:58,348
You mean no equations
apply to your jungle?

719
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,174
Yes

720
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:03,013
Only one requisite

721
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,874
Who has how much power.

722
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:09,074
Power struggle.

723
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:10,905
Iraq or America

724
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,546
Israel or Palestine.

725
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:14,270
White or black.

726
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,740
The priest or the untouchable.
Bill gates or Warren Buffet.

727
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:24,643
And the consequences?

728
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,607
<i>I'll</i> get to that later.

729
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,503
The hotel must be
closed now.

730
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:30,578
Stay back

731
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,671
No, how is that possible?

732
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,404
It's quite late actually.

733
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,109
What if no one opens
the gate at the hotel?

734
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,371
We'll ring the bell,
call them up!

735
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:41,845
They can't have the
reception empty at night.

736
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,878
I'm sure.

737
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:48,814
But I'm no Oscar nominated
psychopath, serial killer or a zombie,

738
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,437
so don't feel lured
and trapped.

739
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,711
And I won't record your
love making and sell it on the internet.

740
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,005
Though it might look spectacular:

741
00:57:58,134 --> 00:58:01,604
No.. err.. we didn't plan
to stay back here,

742
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:04,737
so I was feeling a little
uncomfortable.

743
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:07,773
Break your mental frames

744
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:10,971
We've all escaped from
the urban civilization.

745
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,306
Why?

746
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,771
View life as a series of experiments
You'll have fun

747
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:21,644
And Shohag always wanted to
spend a night at a bungalow like this

748
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,870
Right?

749
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,446
There's this strange fear.

750
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:38,244
We shouldn't have met
him on a trip like this.

751
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,645
His assault is not physical.

752
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,905
<i>Hey.... -.
'What?</i>

753
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:54,577
Can we spend some
time for ourselves?

754
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,378
Hey!-
- Brilliant timing!

755
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:06,673
I must keep a check you see.

756
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:11,205
Two hungry bodies! You
could set each other ablaze!

757
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:13,240
Oh, such a guardian you are!

758
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:16,348
What's our Master doing?
Stuck to you all day?

759
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:19,515
You're such a..
you don't think before you say!

760
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:21,274
Now don't pretend!

761
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,473
Your folks think you're counting
the doors of Hazarduari!

762
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,943
Control, sweetheart!
Control it!

763
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,310
What will happen after marriage
if you finish of the platter now?

764
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:36,473
<i>I'll</i> disconnect now. Bye-
- Hey listen..

765
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:41,010
This girl is such a..-
- Couldn't you switch it off?

766
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,341
Is your phone off?

767
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,502
I might get official calls.

768
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:48,375
I don't have stupid friends like you.-
- Really?

769
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,079
Yes what is it?

770
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:56,871
When are we going to
Marie Stopes clinic?

771
00:59:57,934 --> 00:59:59,936
Give me a chance first?

772
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:02,036
So, how's the car?

773
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:04,911
How was the
mileage on highway?

774
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,402
You've to know this
at this hour?

775
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:09,547
You're on duty all day!

776
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,643
So, I thought...

777
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,308
must be free
at night.

778
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,840
Sol called.

779
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,807
<i>I'll</i> call you tomorrow.

780
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,774
Listen to my ABCD's of love

781
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,313
A for 'all the time',
B for the 'bountiful frolic',

782
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,505
C for 'Condom usage'
and D for 'dissipation.'

783
01:00:25,634 --> 01:00:28,137
Okay?-
- That's why you're a scrap dealer.

784
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,147
Listen, we're the masters of
disaster management.

785
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,309
Bye <i>-
-</i> Bye.

786
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,544
What happens between us is
gossip material for you guys?

787
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,879
My love does not have a birth

788
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:17,746
It does not have a death too.

789
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:25,011
Because I was born with diamonds of
another kind of love, etched into my body.

790
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,246
Good morning!

791
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:05,275
Your tea is getting cold.

792
01:02:08,734 --> 01:02:10,236
Morning.

793
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,138
Who made tea?

794
01:02:12,334 --> 01:02:14,041
Nirbed da

795
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:17,474
He went for a morning
walk after serving the bed tea

796
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,308
Said he'll be back
after going to the market.

797
01:02:20,434 --> 01:02:23,142
Benefits of being the
beautiful reader.

798
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:26,280
Absolute VIP treatment.

799
01:02:28,534 --> 01:02:31,447
You spoke in your
sleep all night.

800
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,802
What did I say?

801
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,143
Nothing clear.
Like a mute cry.

802
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:48,439
Good morning, Nirbed dal-
- Good morning!

803
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,208
Slept well at night?

804
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,743
I've informed them at the
resort that you are here.

805
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,607
And will be back little later.

806
01:02:58,834 --> 01:02:59,812
What is this!

807
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:02,643
Fresh prawn from the
fisherman's net.

808
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,010
And there's squids and
Cuttle fish for you!

809
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,774
Today we will have Calamari
Salad, with potatoes and Squid stew!

810
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:12,009
Wow!-
- Great!

811
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,044
You could've left writing
and opened up a restaurant.

812
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,305
Eating is necessity, cooking is an.

813
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,507
Want to crack a girl,
cooking is the recipe!

814
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,776
So, your love story has
physicality all over it?

815
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,543
Yes

816
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,814
I don't believe in platonic
love and all that jazz

817
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:41,205
But as long as there exists
physicality in a relationship,

818
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:43,780
there's less danger.

819
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:50,011
But...

820
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,511
once the animal
grows a heart...

821
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,011
everything goes Topsy-turvy.

822
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:03,081
The fairies of lullaby,
come to our home.

823
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:07,610
We don't have the luxuries,
come sit on the ﬂoor.

824
01:04:08,033 --> 01:04:11,947
Shall offer you mouthful
of betel leaves

825
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,804
The baby boy can'! sleep
Bless him with some

826
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,404
Didi, phone

827
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,740
Hello?

828
01:04:26,967 --> 01:04:29,675
Mr. Alokesh
really fit the job well.

829
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,607
How do I pay you back...-
- Give me your address.

830
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,002
N o.

831
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,346
Why are you scared of me?

832
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,371
There's no one at home now!

833
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,170
I know.

834
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:52,710
I cannot cheat Srijita any more.

835
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,902
Alokesh is crazily in love me!

836
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:57,808
I care a damn!

837
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,413
It's my life!

838
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,114
18, Arkur Dutt Lane, Wellington.

839
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,078
Do not ring the bell.
Knock

840
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,811
Like a carbuncle,

841
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:19,174
my love has many a vents.

842
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:21,408
Lust, affection,

843
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:23,709
curiosity, dependence.

844
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,506
One of those vents..

845
01:05:27,034 --> 01:05:29,014
Had stung you.

846
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,305
Where does Mr. Alokesh stay?-
- Upstairs.

847
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,071
<i>I'll</i> be back

848
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:52,372
Come, I'm ready.

849
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:56,215
Antu is sleeping

850
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:58,905
On the ﬂoor.

851
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,914
That's a nice collection of Lorca.

852
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,102
From childhood.

853
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,007
I didn't read much
of it as a child.

854
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:12,680
It's not like you alone have taken up
the burden of world literature

855
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,907
Please make it fast. The maid
will come. This isn't a hotel.

856
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:48,613
You spoke of the lack of
stories... so I started writing.

857
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:51,573
I was wondering who to
read it do, so I came.

858
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,806
A novel, 'Wound'.

859
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:10,515
'Some make homes some stay homeless.'
To Antara.

860
01:08:28,933 --> 01:08:32,813
I better go inside Err...-
- No, that won't look good.

861
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:35,914
You better sit here.
Must be Moti.

862
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:39,238
As if you dropped in suddenly.

863
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,509
What is this? I've been
knocking forever!

864
01:08:50,867 --> 01:08:53,245
Listen, Soumik has booked
the bungalow at Piyaljhor.

865
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:54,675
We only have a week.

866
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,637
How is your writing going?

867
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:18,110
As usual.

868
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,608
Why?

869
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,845
No... you've so
many commitments.

870
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,846
Colleagues publishers readers..
male and female, both.

871
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,313
Family, relatives friends women.

872
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:39,571
Maybe you must organize
your life a little

873
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,247
Then how will my thoughts
spread their wings?

874
01:09:43,634 --> 01:09:44,942
Seat belt.

875
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,477
Seat belt?

876
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,107
I don't use it.

877
01:10:11,701 --> 01:10:15,012
Nested you within the dense
shelter of this tree

878
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:17,138
A room where
the light is faint

879
01:10:17,234 --> 01:10:18,212
Goodness!

880
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,180
Never knew Mr. Alokesh
was so romantic!

881
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:24,406
Mugged it up from my
nephew's text book.

882
01:10:24,734 --> 01:10:26,543
Going to the jungle after all.

883
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,511
What if people ask
me to describe it?

884
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:30,976
But this is the description
of an African jungle

885
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,041
And we're going to Palamau.

886
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:37,280
Mr. Alokesh, phone!-
- Hello, Srijita here.

887
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,637
Yes, tell me!

888
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,577
Next week, Piyaljhor, Palamau.

889
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,908
Vodka with cauliﬂower
chops, remember?

890
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:45,708
How do I ask for a leave?
I just joined!

891
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,813
That's Nirbed's job

892
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:51,142
This is Ranchi.

893
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:53,105
Then Lohardaga.
From there towards Mahuadanga

894
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,510
I know this route

895
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:56,672
Let's get out at dawn
tomorrow?

896
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:58,907
I'm getting goosebumps!

897
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,673
At the planning itself?

898
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,840
All Bengalees love the jungle.-
- Let's go, birds!

899
01:11:05,867 --> 01:11:08,347
An eternal darkness in her tresses

900
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:10,812
Like a...-
- Night of Bidhisha

901
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,779
Yes, night. Who's being described here?-
- Bonolota Sen.

902
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,404
Then?

903
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:18,211
Don't people say
it to their wives?

904
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:25,804
I've trekked to Sandakphu,
on foot.

905
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:29,104
And now, even driving
tires my feet.

906
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:31,670
You weren't a domestic
animal back then.

907
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:35,338
Neither was the Uric Acid
such a common problem.

908
01:11:35,934 --> 01:11:38,676
If you feel tired,
tell me.

909
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:43,339
You know how to drive as well?-
- Chill, don't act smart now.

910
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,415
Raka, Shonai, choose your rooms!-
- Beautiful.

911
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,043
Unload the bags.-
- Hello, Sir.

912
01:12:21,367 --> 01:12:22,505
Hello.

913
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,947
Sir, the rooms are opened
They've all been cleaned

914
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,880
So you cook?-
- If you can go to the market...

915
01:12:29,934 --> 01:12:33,347
The word 'market' is so
irritating on a jungle trip!

916
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,743
Have a cycle?-
- Yes.

917
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,710
Okay, listen.

918
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:40,576
Err... two Indian chickens, two
dozens of eggs and nice narrow rice.

919
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:43,078
There's something eerie
about this bungalow.

920
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:46,478
That is what is scary.-
- Why?

921
01:12:46,601 --> 01:12:48,342
Nirbed and Antara

922
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:52,142
Both impulsive
Both, above average

923
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:55,639
Don't act paranoid.
Stop speaking crap.

924
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:10,744
Doesn't the jungle make you
think of yourself as the Tarzan?

925
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:15,041
The dawn has an
aroma of its own here

926
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:20,382
Is it? I cannot smell it.
Though I've a blocked nose.

927
01:13:20,434 --> 01:13:22,641
I'm sniffing steamed cloves

928
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:24,337
The smell of Sal Mahua.

929
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,970
It gets me dazed.

930
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:33,277
Comes into the room at night too.-
<i>- I'll</i> spray some room freshener.

931
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:39,441
The jungle depicts,
'method in madness'.

932
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,406
Wood comes very cheap here

933
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:47,740
Soon, these jungles won't be there.

934
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,407
There won't be humans

935
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:52,581
Love too won't be there.

936
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,113
Raka and Shonai will
sleep in the other room.

937
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:01,575
I know.

938
01:14:01,934 --> 01:14:04,039
Well, I don't know what
the question is

939
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:06,637
but sex is definitely the answer.

940
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:12,840
You know,

941
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:15,143
the village next
to this one,

942
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:19,874
is hit by drought every Summer.

943
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:22,342
God!

944
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:25,008
'Will you stop!?

945
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:31,209
How do you cook without spices?
Get it from the market, <i>I'll</i> pay.

946
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,541
Yes Sir.

947
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,202
And listen

948
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:37,415
Don't mix water into the Mahua.

949
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:41,381
They were murmuring
from their jungle of vomit,

950
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:45,241
'With empty women

951
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:49,113
'With the hot wax children

952
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,949
You seem to have loved
the slice of the new moon

953
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,871
The moon has many jobs but
Today's new moon is the sickle

954
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,308
Sit.

955
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,343
Ti red?

956
01:15:12,067 --> 01:15:13,944
Here...

957
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:19,043
The poet said, 'One body,
yet so many faces.'

958
01:15:19,267 --> 01:15:21,042
Who are you talking about?

959
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:22,775
Why? The pig!

960
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,241
Ham, Salami, Sausage,
Bacon.. slangs!

961
01:15:29,534 --> 01:15:33,744
The river water, its waves,
can you hear it?

962
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,510
The river is far away
from here.

963
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:39,638
As far as Delhi!

964
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:43,939
Two sister-rivers,
Sukri and Ghagri..

965
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:48,540
Then they blend into Koel.-
- A little more than a mile from here

966
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:52,171
But sometimes you
can hear the water.

967
01:15:52,267 --> 01:15:54,076
River cruise tomorrow
morning then!

968
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:55,742
Before that,

969
01:15:55,867 --> 01:15:58,074
french toasts with a little
pepper for breakfast, deal?

970
01:15:58,134 --> 01:15:59,169
Great!

971
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:02,741
I probably cannot go.

972
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:03,977
Why?

973
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,274
The Tuesday man is
happening the village nearby.

974
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:08,069
I'm thinking of going tomorrow.

975
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:11,770
Then, I too cannot go.

976
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,473
Why?

977
01:16:13,867 --> 01:16:15,904
You must go, I've been
there so many times

978
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:18,311
No.-
- Want to go now?

979
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:25,978
That night was brewing all
the ingredients of destruction!

980
01:16:26,134 --> 01:16:27,670
The jungle.

981
01:16:28,234 --> 01:16:30,214
Alcohol.

982
01:16:31,334 --> 01:16:33,712
The ﬂesh of the female body.

983
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,408
The smell of burnt meat!

984
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,703
Want to play an
interesting game?

985
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,678
A memory game again? Please!

986
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:44,204
N o.

987
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:47,874
It's very simple. Everyone can play it.
No need to remember anything.

988
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:49,743
Yes! <i>I will</i> play!

989
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:52,644
I will play!-
- No, I cannot concentrate now.

990
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,972
Very tired-
- You don't need to.

991
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:56,069
Say...

992
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,307
name a friend
of yours with

993
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:00,708
come on? One...

994
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:02,844
two...-
- Tapan!

995
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:04,537
The limping Tapan!

996
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,612
Who's he?-
- A childhood friend.

997
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,874
His left leg was smaller.
Saheb's driver.

998
01:17:09,934 --> 01:17:11,914
Your friend?-
- Bosom friends!

999
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:15,205
Okay, you must answer
within a count of five

1000
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:17,938
Let's start then.
Bishakha, start.

1001
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:22,005
Name a ﬂower, starting with

1002
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:24,679
One...-
- Bokul.

1003
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:26,045
Brilliant!

1004
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:27,938
Good.

1005
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:30,872
I would've named, 'Botphool'!

1006
01:17:31,267 --> 01:17:32,610
Madhusree, your turn.

1007
01:17:32,734 --> 01:17:33,940
A river starting with 'K'.

1008
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:35,241
Kangsabati.

1009
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:37,841
Mr. Alokesh, a bird starting with 'P'.

1010
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:40,033
Pigeon! Pigeon!

1011
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:41,411
Sri's turn.

1012
01:17:41,801 --> 01:17:44,281
A loved one starting with 'R'.

1013
01:17:44,334 --> 01:17:45,711
Rabindranath.-
- Great!

1014
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,140
Intellectual.-
- Antara, your turn.

1015
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:51,043
Name a novel with 'A'.

1016
01:17:56,034 --> 01:17:58,537
'Anurakta'.

1017
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:01,575
By you
I've read it many times.

1018
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:04,443
You seem to have
many girlfriends.

1019
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:06,412
Who said so?

1020
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:08,913
Don't act smart,
everyone knows.

1021
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,712
A special girlfriend's name
starting with

1022
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,905
someone spread across
your heart.

1023
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:32,047
Aslesha.

1024
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,004
Aslesha?

1025
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:21,569
What are you doing here!?

1026
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:25,071
Why did you keep the door open?-
- Leave me!

1027
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:27,214
Please leave me!
Get lost!

1028
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:31,547
You won't go to the
river cruise tomorrow!

1029
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:33,375
They're sleeping, go!-
- You won't go!

1030
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:34,807
Okay, fine

1031
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:36,579
I won't go!

1032
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:38,978
Now, please go! I cannot
take this pressure any more!

1033
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:40,744
Please!

1034
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:42,810
Please!

1035
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:44,477
Please!

1036
01:20:42,334 --> 01:20:44,336
Come on, hurry up.
Only one boat!

1037
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,607
Managed somehow!

1038
01:20:49,267 --> 01:20:52,714
Go, sit in the car.-
- Great! You're no oldie!

1039
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,102
You've rocked it!

1040
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:56,435
Ready?

1041
01:20:56,567 --> 01:20:59,138
Stop pulling his leg,
he is an elderly person

1042
01:21:01,067 --> 01:21:02,637
So you really won't go?

1043
01:21:02,767 --> 01:21:06,613
Come on Nirbed da, you'll miss
the cruise. Think about it.

1044
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:09,246
I've decided not to go
after a good thought.

1045
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,439
I'm going to the Tuesday Man.-
- Right.

1046
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:13,606
So, Mr. Alokesh?
Love or hangover?

1047
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,112
Why are you lame?

1048
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:18,808
Both love and hangover, are
bound to go away in some time.

1049
01:21:18,867 --> 01:21:21,143
But Dysentery in the
jungle is a huge hazard.

1050
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,180
What!-
- You have Dysentery?

1051
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:25,575
Descent people like me can
never have Dysentery.

1052
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,772
Antara. I warned her,
eating pork is an art.

1053
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,743
Avoid the skin hair.
She ignored it.

1054
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,743
I have medicine, you want?

1055
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,073
No, I've already given
her at dawn

1056
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:38,077
She's still leaking like a tank!

1057
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:40,271
Alokesh, you're disgusting!

1058
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:43,437
No... see I told her,
<i>I'll</i> stay back

1059
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:47,805
She started crying; saying
she's ruining our trip!

1060
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:51,148
Do we cancel the programme then?-
- Not at all!

1061
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,977
Dysentery will disappear
in two hours of sleep.

1062
01:21:53,134 --> 01:21:53,874
Come

1063
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,810
Let's set out in
the name of God!

1064
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:59,811
And anyway,
Nirbed is here.

1065
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,208
Let's go.

1066
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,341
Yes Nirbed da, take care
of my wife if you can.

1067
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:08,244
She's the only one I have.
Apple of my eye

1068
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:09,841
Let's go then!

1069
01:22:10,034 --> 01:22:10,910
Let's go.

1070
01:22:37,701 --> 01:22:39,681
'Wild ﬂowers.

1071
01:22:41,467 --> 01:22:44,004
My favourite.

1072
01:22:44,934 --> 01:22:48,643
Weren't you supposed to
go to the Tuesday Man?

1073
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:52,007
Why didn't you join the cruise?

1074
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:54,610
My wish.

1075
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:56,338
Madhu, careful.

1076
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:57,775
Watch your step!!

1077
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:00,413
How does one get
onto a boat in a Sari!

1078
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:05,746
No, I am extremely scared.
I won't be able to go.

1079
01:23:06,234 --> 01:23:07,611
What!-
- Yes.

1080
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,106
You guys carry on,
<i>I'll</i> wait here.

1081
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:14,146
Wham!

1082
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,010
It's about to rain.

1083
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:21,677
Ever seen it raining in the jungle?

1084
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,880
In my childhood.

1085
01:23:30,734 --> 01:23:33,772
I had gone to Kaziranga
with my parents.

1086
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,070
I was eight.

1087
01:23:38,367 --> 01:23:44,977
Me and my father were picking up
fruits in the bungalow garden in the rain.

1088
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:48,748
Suddenly, Baba fell down.

1089
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,311
Absolutely calm.

1090
01:23:55,467 --> 01:23:58,448
Baba passed away.

1091
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:03,173
Heavy smoker.

1092
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:05,041
Cardiac death

1093
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:14,442
Rain always scares me, as if
it's fateful.

1094
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,440
There's a spring nearby.

1095
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:28,072
Jitipahar.

1096
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,406
Sankhapushpi jungle

1097
01:24:36,134 --> 01:24:39,638
The world is still
very beautiful, Antara.

1098
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:45,045
Want to go?

1099
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,408
No, I'm staying here.
You guys come back fast.

1100
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:01,444
Since when have you been
scared of water?

1101
01:25:01,534 --> 01:25:02,808
You'll stay alone in
this jungle?

1102
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:03,605
So?

1103
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:06,041
It's only around two
hours <i>I'll</i> manage.

1104
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,746
Okay then!
See you!

1105
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:08,972
Do you remember?

1106
01:25:09,601 --> 01:25:13,310
Sri stood first in the
inter-college swimming competition?

1107
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:18,841
Maybe she developed hydrophobia
after marriage.

1108
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:27,611
Astounding!

1109
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:33,240
Walk into the new stream!

1110
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:40,212
Can you fathom why I
didn't go to the river?

1111
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:46,610
Not to save Alokesh's job

1112
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,402
But...-

1113
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:57,740
- You've fallen in
love with me, Antara

1114
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,137
I don't know.
Maybe.

1115
01:26:42,034 --> 01:26:45,015
Salt and pepper cuttle fish
in sweet soya

1116
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,202
Coming soon.

1117
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,836
How can one cheat
so many people?

1118
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,878
Possible

1119
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,911
Absolutely possible

1120
01:26:59,034 --> 01:27:03,574
Otherwise this civilization, it's
culture, the rules and regulations,

1121
01:27:04,034 --> 01:27:06,036
police, parliament, militia..

1122
01:27:06,734 --> 01:27:09,214
Everything would have
come to a halt.

1123
01:27:12,134 --> 01:27:13,807
An what if I say, you're

1124
01:27:13,934 --> 01:27:16,471
coward, manipulative,
pretentious...-

1125
01:27:16,634 --> 01:27:18,238
- Rishabh!

1126
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,876
Where's the forest bungalow?-
- You've come the wrong way

1127
01:27:43,034 --> 01:27:46,447
This is the Sankhapushpi jungle.
You are near the cascade...

1128
01:29:49,067 --> 01:29:52,071
Nirbed da!
Is Srijita back?

1129
01:29:52,534 --> 01:29:55,208
Why, hasn't she come
back with you?

1130
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:57,212
What do you mean?

1131
01:29:57,334 --> 01:29:59,314
She didn't come on the boat with us.-
- What!

1132
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,937
She got nervous looking
at the ﬂoating boat.

1133
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,573
She said she'll wait for us
at the bank!

1134
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,146
And you left her alone?

1135
01:30:07,267 --> 01:30:10,578
She would be here by now if
she walked back in the storm

1136
01:30:10,634 --> 01:30:13,547
We are late because the
road was blocked.

1137
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:16,147
What happened?-
- Sri hasn't come back!

1138
01:30:16,234 --> 01:30:18,874
Did I lose everything?

1139
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,480
Everything!-
- Where's he going?

1140
01:30:21,567 --> 01:30:24,173
Soumik da I think you go
towards the jungle.

1141
01:30:24,234 --> 01:30:25,838
Spread out.

1142
01:30:26,001 --> 01:30:28,003
<i>I'll</i> go towards the river.-
- Okay!

1143
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:29,171
<i>I'll stay here</i>

1144
01:30:29,267 --> 01:30:32,407
Look for the caretaker!-
- Kids, don't go anywhere!

1145
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:33,605
Sri! -.
" -Srijita!!

1146
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:35,269
I'm going to the jungle!

1147
01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:40,147
Why did you leave her alone?

1148
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:42,436
“WW:

1149
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,143
Srijita!

1150
01:30:58,634 --> 01:31:00,477
Sriiita!.
<i>'</i> Sri!

1151
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,510
Srijita!

1152
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,977
Sri!

1153
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:34,276
What are you two up to?-
- Is Srijita back?

1154
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,514
Don't act innocent.

1155
01:31:38,734 --> 01:31:40,873
Why?-
- You know why!

1156
01:31:41,901 --> 01:31:45,371
What've I done?-
- You don't care for your family!

1157
01:31:45,434 --> 01:31:48,847
Ruined Alokesh's life!

1158
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,846
Why break Srijita's home?

1159
01:31:51,701 --> 01:31:54,910
Has Srijita come to know
about us?

1160
01:31:57,534 --> 01:31:58,706
I don't know!

1161
01:31:59,134 --> 01:32:02,138
But why's she not coming back?
What do you think of yourself?

1162
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,644
Why are you saying this
to me?

1163
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:06,399
Don't you know why?

1164
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,609
Gold medalist in college, popular
writer from the Little Magazine!

1165
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:11,146
Is that my mistake?

1166
01:32:11,267 --> 01:32:12,974
Numerous boyfriends
reckless nightlife!

1167
01:32:13,101 --> 01:32:14,273
I've grown up like that!

1168
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:16,278
Fell in love with Tridib!
Your cousin!

1169
01:32:16,367 --> 01:32:18,108
He ditched you!

1170
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,943
He got scared...-
- You should be scared too!

1171
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:28,707
Left your studies married
Alokesh suddenly!

1172
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:32,007
Didn't know he's not like you?-
- But I love Alokesh!

1173
01:32:32,267 --> 01:32:36,079
Liar. You only love yourself!

1174
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,344
N o.

1175
01:32:37,401 --> 01:32:40,541
Your thought process,
your logic, sensibility, ambition!

1176
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,738
I never had an ambition,
still don't have one!

1177
01:32:48,234 --> 01:32:51,579
Alokesh is our friend, Antara! If
anything happens to him...-

1178
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:53,510
- Why will something happen to him!?

1179
01:32:53,667 --> 01:32:54,407
Sorry.

1180
01:32:55,634 --> 01:32:56,442
Sorry.

1181
01:32:56,534 --> 01:32:58,138
I must intervene

1182
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,207
Come to the room. Don't
create a fuss in this crisis.

1183
01:33:01,334 --> 01:33:03,780
I want to go back to Kolkata!-
- Everyone does!

1184
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,976
We can't leave before
tomorrow morning. Come!

1185
01:33:07,367 --> 01:33:08,846
Soumik da!

1186
01:33:10,734 --> 01:33:12,236
Relax.

1187
01:33:12,434 --> 01:33:14,573
We'll talk later.

1188
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,971
Let's get back to the bungalow.

1189
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:08,442
Everyone is looking
for you.

1190
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:12,839
How long has it been?

1191
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:22,705
It has been a few days

1192
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:27,944
It's all my doing.

1193
01:34:28,967 --> 01:34:30,810
Antara ..

1194
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:35,144
Was somewhat coerced.

1195
01:34:35,267 --> 01:34:38,441
Is Alokesh an idiot?

1196
01:34:38,634 --> 01:34:42,582
Or did he do the pimping?

1197
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:48,475
Alokesh or...

1198
01:34:49,067 --> 01:34:50,478
anyone else does not know that...-

1199
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:52,308
- That she's a whore!

1200
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,044
Right?

1201
01:34:54,867 --> 01:34:56,778
How much does Alokesh draw...

1202
01:34:56,934 --> 01:34:58,504
from Drishtikon..

1203
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:01,441
That Antara spread
her legs so easily?

1204
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:03,336
Desperate bitch!

1205
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:05,344
Bloody whore!-
- Srijita!

1206
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:07,271
You bastard!

1207
01:35:07,734 --> 01:35:09,509
Look at me See this!
- No!

1208
01:35:09,634 --> 01:35:12,171
This ﬂesh. You bloody letch!
- No, Srijita!

1209
01:35:12,734 --> 01:35:14,577
You bastard!-
- Srijita!

1210
01:35:14,767 --> 01:35:16,747
Srijita, no!-
- Don'! touch me!

1211
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,380
Leave me you swine
Please calm down, Srijita!

1212
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,676
<i>I'll</i> kill you!
You son of a bitch!

1213
01:35:22,901 --> 01:35:24,903
Please, Srijita!
Please!

1214
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:30,377
I hate you!

1215
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,980
I hate you!

1216
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:46,440
Be it the storm the ﬂood, Aslesha (a
catastrophe), a tornado or the hurricane.

1217
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:50,813
They can never be better
philanderers than me.

1218
01:35:51,034 --> 01:35:54,914
I rule 'creation' and 'stability', both.

1219
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,813
I am 'destruction'.

1220
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,705
I've always been stubborn.

1221
01:36:04,734 --> 01:36:10,912
Never listened to anybody
But the very same me broke down too.

1222
01:36:11,334 --> 01:36:14,781
Did everyone come to know?

1223
01:36:15,934 --> 01:36:17,777
N o.

1224
01:36:18,601 --> 01:36:23,607
Others were told Srijita got lost
in the rain and contracted fever.

1225
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:27,179
It was urgent to get medical help.

1226
01:36:31,867 --> 01:36:36,509
Why didn't you two
divorce and remarry?

1227
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:46,081
I wanted to go back to Srijita

1228
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:54,081
That was once in life I felt, let
rules win over desires.

1229
01:37:06,634 --> 01:37:08,807
Where are the kids?

1230
01:37:08,967 --> 01:37:12,107
Raka is back from the dance
class and Shonai is sleeping

1231
01:37:15,534 --> 01:37:17,070
Have to talk.

1232
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,577
Two minutes

1233
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,706
Yes

1234
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:25,110
Read, then we'll talk.

1235
01:37:30,067 --> 01:37:34,607
What is there to read? You've
already taken the decision!

1236
01:37:37,267 --> 01:37:39,907
It was your decision
to call it quits!

1237
01:37:40,067 --> 01:37:42,980
Did you consult me?

1238
01:37:43,501 --> 01:37:45,310
Sit.-
- No, Nirbed!

1239
01:37:45,434 --> 01:37:48,108
I don't want to go on
with this relationship!

1240
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,302
Not even for the kids!

1241
01:37:50,467 --> 01:37:54,005
And don't forget, I'm
financially independent!

1242
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:54,976
I know.

1243
01:37:55,067 --> 01:38:00,244
And that you womanize randomly,
your colleagues have told me that

1244
01:38:00,334 --> 01:38:03,042
Every action has a reaction!

1245
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:07,172
There's a difference between
reaction and revenge

1246
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,840
Sri...

1247
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:12,112
Sri, I love you!

1248
01:38:12,567 --> 01:38:15,207
No! You don't love me!

1249
01:38:15,334 --> 01:38:16,745
You love ﬂesh!

1250
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:20,541
You get turned on by each and
every woman you come across!

1251
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,102
Sex is a...

1252
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:25,178
pleasure to you all.

1253
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:28,004
It's an adventure to me.

1254
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:31,838
I fuck like an explorer.

1255
01:38:32,067 --> 01:38:35,810
I am honest! I don't fake
with relationships!

1256
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:38,047
You are sick!

1257
01:38:38,934 --> 01:38:41,847
You need whores
and you need shrinks!

1258
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:45,505
I like curves! I cannot
stay without seeing it!

1259
01:38:45,667 --> 01:38:49,205
You dirty voyeur! You
don't spare the maid too!

1260
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,041
The world sells curves and we buy it!

1261
01:38:51,201 --> 01:38:52,839
It teaches you to control
your impulses too!

1262
01:38:52,934 --> 01:38:56,973
I cannot get regulated, Sri.

1263
01:38:57,834 --> 01:39:00,940
I push my boundaries and live
on the edges but that's got...

1264
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:03,038
nothing to do with our love!

1265
01:39:03,134 --> 01:39:04,772
Why don't you understand Sri,

1266
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:07,007
what I write today, the
world understands that tomorrow!

1267
01:39:07,134 --> 01:39:10,274
I build characters and the characters
become their role models.

1268
01:39:10,434 --> 01:39:13,142
I question ethics and the questions
become their code of conduct!

1269
01:39:13,301 --> 01:39:16,009
But you and me..-
- Go fuck your creation then!

1270
01:39:16,134 --> 01:39:19,775
Fuck your own filthy paperback
characters! Spare me!

1271
01:39:20,234 --> 01:39:22,373
Please don't leave me

1272
01:39:22,434 --> 01:39:24,710
Please don't go...

1273
01:39:25,234 --> 01:39:27,236
<i>I'll</i> change myself, Sri.

1274
01:39:29,767 --> 01:39:33,510
Then let us live as paying
guests, in a motel.

1275
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:35,676
And don't you dare...

1276
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:37,713
look at my face or my
children's!

1277
01:39:38,467 --> 01:39:40,413
You spineless bastard!

1278
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,613
You must give us
something, Nirbed da

1279
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:44,648
Yes I was thinking on writing about
the Mujahideens of Afghanistan.

1280
01:40:44,734 --> 01:40:46,805
It's been ages I touched the pen.

1281
01:40:46,867 --> 01:40:50,371
But... err...-
- Give me <i>3</i> or 4 days.

1282
01:40:51,067 --> 01:40:53,206
It's getting formed in my mind.

1283
01:40:53,267 --> 01:40:54,769
Saturday?

1284
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,676
Saturday... okay.

1285
01:40:59,467 --> 01:41:01,743
Okay, we'll leave today.-
- Bye.

1286
01:41:01,967 --> 01:41:04,811
What is up with you, Nirbed?

1287
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:06,811
You're not into your writing.

1288
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,573
Dhrubo Lahiri was the happier
man, Ghatak da

1289
01:41:12,434 --> 01:41:15,074
Becoming Nirbed Lahiri
landed me in trouble

1290
01:41:17,233 --> 01:41:20,339
I've to climb out of
myself everyday.

1291
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:23,504
Like a volcano inside..

1292
01:41:24,067 --> 01:41:26,570
I am bubbling with
anti-establishment thoughts.

1293
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,211
But if it explodes
you're a criminal.

1294
01:41:32,267 --> 01:41:35,043
I cannot handle this any more!

1295
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:39,509
Think of Tagore.

1296
01:41:41,401 --> 01:41:43,779
He maybe an idol.

1297
01:41:45,334 --> 01:41:51,285
Physically, mentally,
I became alone

1298
01:41:52,134 --> 01:41:55,013
I never...

1299
01:41:55,334 --> 01:41:59,111
called Antara again.

1300
01:42:00,667 --> 01:42:02,374
autobiography-

1301
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,409
Novel. 'Khawto - the Wound'.

1302
01:42:09,934 --> 01:42:12,813
My last work.

1303
01:42:14,667 --> 01:42:18,581
Incomplete
Unpublished.

1304
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:21,941
I'm giving this to you.-
- Really?

1305
01:42:23,301 --> 01:42:28,148
But don't open the gift before
you reach home Promise?

1306
01:42:28,834 --> 01:42:30,472
Promise.

1307
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:36,339
Don't you have a photo
of Antara with you?

1308
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:39,840
Obviously.

1309
01:42:41,034 --> 01:42:47,110
That was all I carried
when I embraced celibacy.

1310
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:50,038
Yes, I do.

1311
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:55,647
I take a look at it everyday.

1312
01:43:05,067 --> 01:43:08,071
You can cut all the ﬂowers

1313
01:43:08,234 --> 01:43:11,215
But can'! stop spring from coming

1314
01:43:16,101 --> 01:43:18,638
What is it, Rishabh?

1315
01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:22,947
I know this woman.

1316
01:43:24,967 --> 01:43:29,643
I have seen her at the
Helpage India Asylum many times.

1317
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:33,910
What are you saying!

1318
01:43:35,767 --> 01:43:37,713
Antara is alive?

1319
01:43:39,367 --> 01:43:40,607
Yes

1320
01:43:41,868 --> 01:43:44,747
But she has lost sanity.

1321
01:43:45,734 --> 01:43:48,943
I go for the community
services, sol know.

1322
01:43:49,434 --> 01:43:52,108
And her name
is not Antara.

1323
01:43:52,634 --> 01:43:55,274
Damayanti Chakrabarty.

1324
01:43:55,567 --> 01:43:57,342
Right.

1325
01:43:59,334 --> 01:44:02,508
She is named Antara
in my novel.

1326
01:44:02,867 --> 01:44:05,973
And Alokesh's real name?

1327
01:44:08,134 --> 01:44:10,341
Ananda

1328
01:44:11,934 --> 01:44:14,847
'Will you go with
us tomorrow?

1329
01:44:15,001 --> 01:44:16,480
Rishabh,

1330
01:44:16,767 --> 01:44:19,543
'Will you take us to the asylum?

1331
01:44:20,534 --> 01:44:22,707
I want to see her once

1332
01:44:22,934 --> 01:44:25,437
'Antara' from the novel, 'Khawto'.

1333
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:33,443
I still have a collection of
Lorca, borrowed from her.

1334
01:44:37,167 --> 01:44:39,078
If I can...

1335
01:44:52,334 --> 01:44:54,746
It's quite late.

1336
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,307
Won't you come? It's
along drive tomorrow.

1337
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:05,039
I can't sleep.

1338
01:45:06,367 --> 01:45:08,108
Come here

1339
01:45:08,267 --> 01:45:10,474
I really need you.

1340
01:45:10,767 --> 01:45:13,543
Sorry, I really
don't feel like.

1341
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:20,645
Everything is a
huge disarray

1342
01:45:21,501 --> 01:45:24,448
I fade away

1343
01:45:24,601 --> 01:45:27,775
By the day

1344
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:34,147
Where am I in the
Blue of this sky?

1345
01:45:34,534 --> 01:45:40,416
The galaxy of memories
Have washed away

1346
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,272
The same story
All over the world

1347
01:45:45,401 --> 01:45:49,213
Winter and Summer
All are futile

1348
01:45:50,367 --> 01:45:53,473
Oh Sea
Humble is my presence

1349
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:57,310
Quaff me back into your blue

1350
01:45:58,467 --> 01:46:01,573
Pushing through the crowd

1351
01:46:01,834 --> 01:46:05,179
Trudging ahead

1352
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:08,008
Stumbling on the hitches

1353
01:46:08,534 --> 01:46:11,947
I stand still

1354
01:46:12,567 --> 01:46:12,999
We could've played Antakshari
today if you would have stayed back

1355
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,174
We could've played Antakshari
today if you would have stayed back

1356
01:46:16,301 --> 01:46:19,407
I cannot remember songs.-
- Brahmi leaves.

1357
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,970
Have it and give her too.
Two benefits, good memory and no Piles!

1358
01:46:23,067 --> 01:46:24,410
Ah! Baba!

1359
01:46:24,534 --> 01:46:26,707
Give me your Kolkata address.

1360
01:46:26,801 --> 01:46:29,111
I have a Yoga Consultancy firm.

1361
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,613
<i>I'll</i> go give you counselling
and suggestions every week.

1362
01:46:33,134 --> 01:46:35,637
Shohag, give your address.
I'm a Bohemian, live in a mess.

1363
01:46:35,834 --> 01:46:40,146
Oh no! I forgot the address.-
- That's why Brahmi leaves!

1364
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:42,838
There.. see...

1365
01:46:42,967 --> 01:46:45,641
your Santa Clause is
here with his sack!

1366
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,280
We won't wait any more,
Mr. Avinash. Bye.

1367
01:46:48,467 --> 01:46:49,741
Bye!

1368
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:54,976
Where are you three off to?

1369
01:46:55,134 --> 01:46:56,442
Mental asylum!

1370
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:11,710
You can stay back at a hotel and
return tomorrow morning by train.

1371
01:47:12,034 --> 01:47:14,071
<i>I'll</i> figure that out.

1372
01:47:14,234 --> 01:47:15,645
But why...

1373
01:47:15,767 --> 01:47:20,409
Rishabh has already asked his friend to
book a three star hotel room for you

1374
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:23,743
I'm not that big any more!-
- Complimentary.

1375
01:47:23,867 --> 01:47:27,576
One can do this for
a person like you.

1376
01:47:36,234 --> 01:47:37,679
Welcome, Sir,
how are you?

1377
01:47:37,734 --> 01:47:41,079
Sir, I couldn't meet you last
week. I came back to see,

1378
01:47:41,167 --> 01:47:42,805
everyone is praising you so much!

1379
01:47:43,434 --> 01:47:47,746
But one thing, Sir, we need a
TV set in the common room.

1380
01:47:47,934 --> 01:47:52,576
My guests Take them to cell no. 302.
<i>I'll</i> check on the others and come.

1381
01:47:52,701 --> 01:47:53,907
Yes

1382
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:57,371
Rishabh seems to know
everyone here

1383
01:47:57,467 --> 01:47:59,413
Yes, he's been with
Helpage for along time.

1384
01:47:59,767 --> 01:48:01,713
Please come, Madam
Sir, please.

1385
01:48:38,134 --> 01:48:41,547
Aslesha?

1386
01:48:44,334 --> 01:48:46,644
Damayanti?

1387
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:49,681
I'm Nirbed.

1388
01:48:52,267 --> 01:48:55,043
Your Nirbed.

1389
01:49:03,267 --> 01:49:07,181
'Sonnets to his Dark Love'

1390
01:49:07,867 --> 01:49:10,814
Lorca's last work!

1391
01:49:12,767 --> 01:49:15,441
Your favourite!

1392
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:30,510
Oh no! What are you doing?

1393
01:49:33,134 --> 01:49:34,511
Let her be

1394
01:49:36,867 --> 01:49:38,608
This has got...

1395
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,005
the breaths of her loved
ones hidden in it.

1396
01:49:49,534 --> 01:49:51,138
Beats me...

1397
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,073
Beams me a lot.

1398
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:07,281
I guess it's time to leave.

1399
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,002
Shapui, lunchtime!

1400
01:50:22,068 --> 01:50:24,105
Everyone is hungry.-
- Yes Sir!

1401
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:33,873
So?

1402
01:50:34,067 --> 01:50:36,911
How does it feel to be
back in the urban civilization?

1403
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:38,775
I feel like,

1404
01:50:39,034 --> 01:50:41,014
I've set foot on
the killing fields

1405
01:50:42,467 --> 01:50:45,141
My killer awaits.
There's no escape.

1406
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,779
Come on!

1407
01:50:47,901 --> 01:50:50,245
How far is the hotel from here?

1408
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:52,111
Five minutes drive.

1409
01:50:52,368 --> 01:50:54,507
But <i>I'll</i> take a leave from here

1410
01:50:59,634 --> 01:51:02,706
Open the gift when
you get home

1411
01:51:02,834 --> 01:51:04,973
Surprise?

1412
01:51:18,301 --> 01:51:22,943
The urban civilization is
changing fast, Rishabh.

1413
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:27,745
The truth is, the jungle is
spreading out.

1414
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,303
Cheers-
- Cheers

1415
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:42,474
So everyone got scattered.

1416
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:48,007
But I didn't expect such a shallow
climax from an author like you.

1417
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:52,373
You mean the end could've
been a bit more dramatic?

1418
01:51:52,667 --> 01:51:54,237
Surely.

1419
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,346
You left away the
most hard-hitting bit!

1420
01:51:56,567 --> 01:52:00,777
Wasn't the last chapter
supposed to be more thrilling?

1421
01:52:03,101 --> 01:52:06,810
Since you've got it,
<i>I'll</i> have to tell you

1422
01:52:08,767 --> 01:52:11,247
A distance had grown,

1423
01:52:12,901 --> 01:52:15,643
between me and Srijita

1424
01:52:17,167 --> 01:52:20,114
I had closed myself.

1425
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:24,112
The end could have been drab

1426
01:52:26,634 --> 01:52:29,672
But Antara did not let that happen.

1427
01:52:29,834 --> 01:52:32,508
Damayanti.

1428
01:52:37,034 --> 01:52:39,036
Hello?-
- May I speak to Nirbed da?

1429
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,738
Who is this?-
- Give him the phone.

1430
01:52:40,867 --> 01:52:42,437
Oh Hold on.

1431
01:52:43,367 --> 01:52:44,675
Nirbed da,

1432
01:52:45,367 --> 01:52:46,539
there's a call
for you.

1433
01:52:46,634 --> 01:52:47,942
Who is it?

1434
01:52:48,034 --> 01:52:50,036
Did not tell her name.

1435
01:52:51,301 --> 01:52:53,076
We'll make a move, Nirbed da

1436
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:56,211
Hello?

1437
01:52:56,334 --> 01:52:57,404
What is it?

1438
01:52:57,701 --> 01:52:59,009
Got scared?

1439
01:52:59,967 --> 01:53:01,241
Somewhat.

1440
01:53:01,434 --> 01:53:03,471
For the sake of you and Alokesh

1441
01:53:03,934 --> 01:53:07,939
Do the wild animals who ﬂee the jungle
enter a civilized world?

1442
01:53:09,734 --> 01:53:12,214
I love you, Antara.

1443
01:53:12,667 --> 01:53:16,672
But I thought it out,
we must stop now.

1444
01:53:17,267 --> 01:53:19,474
That's why you didn't
call after getting back.

1445
01:53:19,667 --> 01:53:22,113
What do you want?-
- It's Five PM right now.

1446
01:53:22,467 --> 01:53:26,244
You have a car.
Meet me at 5:30, sharp

1447
01:53:26,467 --> 01:53:30,244
Bhawanipur Basanta Cabin.-
- Mr. Alokesh took a half-day off.

1448
01:53:30,334 --> 01:53:33,611
It's your anniversary on
Saturday, everyone's invited.

1449
01:53:33,901 --> 01:53:36,313
I know.-
- He's gone to that side for shopping

1450
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,311
I know!-
- Let it be today, Antara.

1451
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:40,274
Listen to me-
- What?

1452
01:53:40,801 --> 01:53:42,940
We'll meet later, okay?-
- Tomorrow?

1453
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:43,837
N o.

1454
01:53:45,667 --> 01:53:47,010
Day after?

1455
01:53:47,067 --> 01:53:49,877
No, let me find an
apartment first.

1456
01:53:50,167 --> 01:53:51,612
The next day, then?
Friday?

1457
01:53:51,834 --> 01:53:54,212
No, Saturday
What is wrong with you?

1458
01:53:56,034 --> 01:53:58,913
Bye <i>I'll</i> call
on Saturday.

1459
01:53:59,668 --> 01:54:02,547
I have lost everything,
Nirbed da!

1460
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:05,442
Now you cannot step back!

1461
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:07,676
And I?
Haven't I...

1462
01:54:09,434 --> 01:54:11,812
lost everything too,
Antara?

1463
01:54:51,701 --> 01:54:53,374
Close your eyes.-
- Leave me

1464
01:54:53,467 --> 01:54:54,707
Let me make tea

1465
01:54:54,834 --> 01:54:57,747
That can happen later.
First, close your eyes

1466
01:54:58,134 --> 01:55:01,513
Make it fast. And Moti,
give him some water!

1467
01:55:01,667 --> 01:55:04,170
Just close your eyes.

1468
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:09,147
What is it?-
- Here, take this!

1469
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,302
How is it?

1470
01:55:11,367 --> 01:55:15,213
Happy marriage anniversary!-
- That's on Saturday, after <i>3</i> days.

1471
01:55:15,334 --> 01:55:19,146
Why did you spend so much?-
- What is wrong with you!

1472
01:55:19,667 --> 01:55:23,342
Look at me Why that frown on your face?
- Oh please!

1473
01:55:23,767 --> 01:55:25,246
Don't you know me?

1474
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:28,007
Can I ever save?
I always end up spending.

1475
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:30,603
Sol did not take the risk
and bought it.

1476
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:33,681
What is it, son?-
- Make him go to sleep!

1477
01:55:33,934 --> 01:55:36,414
Hey listen,
I've bought jumbo prawns!

1478
01:55:37,267 --> 01:55:39,577
You know for how much?
600 rupees!

1479
01:55:39,734 --> 01:55:42,613
The thing is I've invited
everyone from work!

1480
01:55:42,734 --> 01:55:45,647
I didn't even have a choice.
They all love me so much!

1481
01:55:46,301 --> 01:55:47,837
Have a look!

1482
01:55:48,301 --> 01:55:50,804
Hilsa! Must be 25 Kgs
at least? Right?

1483
01:55:50,934 --> 01:55:53,039
They thought they'll fool me
with the weight.

1484
01:55:53,168 --> 01:55:55,307
Is it that easy to fool me?

1485
01:55:55,367 --> 01:55:58,610
You understand the weight of Hilsa
Any idea about your own weight?

1486
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,838
Bloody impulsive!

1487
01:56:01,067 --> 01:56:03,308
Eating, sleeping and humping!

1488
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,912
Cats and dogs in the
locality live this life!

1489
01:56:07,534 --> 01:56:12,176
You are a grade-3 cash assistant at
an eminent publishing house.

1490
01:56:12,434 --> 01:56:15,005
Keep that in mind.

1491
01:56:15,467 --> 01:56:18,038
Stupid glorified peon...

1492
01:56:21,301 --> 01:56:24,145
May I come in, Ghatak da?-
- Yes please.

1493
01:56:26,967 --> 01:56:29,072
Do you know a middleman?

1494
01:56:29,334 --> 01:56:30,972
Yes, many of them.

1495
01:56:31,467 --> 01:56:33,469
I, myself am one.

1496
01:56:33,634 --> 01:56:35,136
I was thinking...

1497
01:56:36,034 --> 01:56:37,843
of hiring an apartment

1498
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,946
All of a sudden?

1499
01:56:40,567 --> 01:56:43,343
Home, office, PR, accounts...

1500
01:56:43,567 --> 01:56:48,676
my thoughts are twirling around like
a wheel but not developing

1501
01:56:49,934 --> 01:56:54,576
Sol was looking for a place
to sit and write peacefully.

1502
01:56:54,867 --> 01:56:56,744
I know someone.

1503
01:56:56,867 --> 01:56:59,541
He deals in real estate.

1504
01:56:59,601 --> 01:57:02,241
Should I call for
him tomorrow?

1505
01:57:17,667 --> 01:57:20,671
The carpet area is
nearly 1100 square feet.

1506
01:57:20,867 --> 01:57:22,642
One bedroom hall, kitchen.

1507
01:57:22,734 --> 01:57:26,011
Attached bath with the bedroom
Door connects to the hall.

1508
01:57:26,067 --> 01:57:28,843
Third ﬂoor. Seasonal
wind outside the window.

1509
01:57:28,934 --> 01:57:30,504
Don't do poetry.-
- Correct, Sir.

1510
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,773
That's our job.-
- Right, Sir.

1511
01:57:32,967 --> 01:57:35,038
I want to see it
today itself.

1512
01:57:38,634 --> 01:57:39,942
Go, see it, Sir.

1513
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,913
That's the original. The duplicate..-
- Give it to me

1514
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,240
Yes

1515
01:57:44,334 --> 01:57:46,610
I'm keeping the duplicate keys.

1516
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:48,644
You'll lose it in no time

1517
01:57:59,401 --> 01:58:01,039
Hello?-
- Hello?

1518
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,941
I was waiting for your call.-
- Today is...

1519
01:58:04,167 --> 01:58:05,168
Saturday.

1520
01:58:05,267 --> 01:58:06,871
Found a place?

1521
01:58:07,734 --> 01:58:09,873
Write down the address.

1522
01:58:21,067 --> 01:58:23,741
Rang the bell quite a
few times.

1523
01:58:24,767 --> 01:58:26,610
The bell doesn't work.

1524
01:58:27,401 --> 01:58:29,039
Come inside

1525
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:38,176
I thought,

1526
01:58:38,334 --> 01:58:41,838
you'll arrange for
a proper ceremony.

1527
01:58:42,034 --> 01:58:44,139
To welcome me

1528
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:46,712
A new household
after all.

1529
01:58:48,167 --> 01:58:49,475
Come

1530
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:52,582
May I come in, Ghatak da?-
- Yes, Alokesh

1531
01:58:53,167 --> 01:58:55,943
I remember: Dinner at
your place tonight.

1532
01:58:56,101 --> 01:58:59,275
Anniversary, right?-
- No, I came for different a reason.

1533
01:58:59,767 --> 01:59:01,769
Raktim da from Jamhor
Patrika is here.

1534
01:59:01,867 --> 01:59:03,107
Come inside?

1535
01:59:03,267 --> 01:59:04,405
Oh no!

1536
01:59:05,901 --> 01:59:07,437
The empty womb...

1537
01:59:08,267 --> 01:59:11,805
Couldn't you come earlier?-
- Got stuck in the jam.

1538
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:15,081
Nirbed just left.-
- What do we do now?

1539
01:59:15,134 --> 01:59:17,410
We've to submit the
write-up today!

1540
01:59:17,634 --> 01:59:20,945
If, where he's gone
has a phone and

1541
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:24,273
we know the address
then we can get it.

1542
01:59:25,134 --> 01:59:27,546
Go back to Alokesh, Antara.

1543
01:59:28,367 --> 01:59:30,472
What is the point?

1544
01:59:30,734 --> 01:59:32,839
Who do I go back to?

1545
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,641
Alokesh is a child.

1546
01:59:35,734 --> 01:59:38,510
Do you know how
old is he inside?

1547
01:59:38,868 --> 01:59:41,508
Who are we to judge that?

1548
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:44,708
He is lovable

1549
01:59:44,967 --> 01:59:47,607
Do you find me
monotonous these days?

1550
01:59:49,334 --> 01:59:50,642
N o.

1551
01:59:53,467 --> 01:59:55,469
Can't you take it on Monday?-
- Errr

1552
01:59:55,534 --> 01:59:58,572
- No, Mr. Ghatak, we'll
be in huge trouble.

1553
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,637
Hey, Alokesh, do one thing,

1554
02:00:02,734 --> 02:00:05,943
go and check at this
address once.

1555
02:00:06,501 --> 02:00:09,880
Nirbed had said he
finished writing it.

1556
02:00:10,034 --> 02:00:11,342
Alokesh..-
- Yes?

1557
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,401
Do you...

1558
02:00:13,334 --> 02:00:16,315
know GOA, Ballygunje
place, East?

1559
02:00:17,067 --> 02:00:20,571
Ghatak da, I'm the Columbus
of Kolkata, I know all of it.

1560
02:00:21,267 --> 02:00:23,247
Give me the keys.

1561
02:00:23,734 --> 02:00:25,873
What I've lost is lost.

1562
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:31,538
I don't want...

1563
02:00:34,834 --> 02:00:37,610
your home to break

1564
02:00:38,867 --> 02:00:43,338
You are not strong
enough to endure that.

1565
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:47,211
My have no control over
my decisions any more.

1566
02:00:49,134 --> 02:00:51,205
Why are you
being so childish?

1567
02:00:51,367 --> 02:00:54,371
I won't behave childishly
any more, I promise

1568
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,377
I will distance myself from you.

1569
02:00:56,434 --> 02:01:01,213
Only a few more days please.
No one will know if we meet here

1570
02:01:01,601 --> 02:01:04,411
Hug me tight, Nirbed da, please!

1571
02:01:07,467 --> 02:01:09,469
What are you up to?

1572
02:01:14,634 --> 02:01:16,636
It's raining, Antara.

1573
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:18,144
It's raining.

1574
02:02:01,267 --> 02:02:03,679
Which one is it...

1575
02:02:13,867 --> 02:02:16,746
Come on, Mr. Key,
be of use

1576
02:04:26,534 --> 02:04:28,241
Look inside the room.

1577
02:04:29,267 --> 02:04:30,769
No one here!

1578
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,675
There?-
- No!

1579
02:04:33,434 --> 02:04:36,881
Moti, is Alokesh back?-
- Yes, in the loo.

1580
02:04:44,267 --> 02:04:45,473
Alokesh!

1581
02:04:46,034 --> 02:04:47,604
I wasn't there!

1582
02:04:47,768 --> 02:04:49,748
Knew he would end
up doing something!

1583
02:04:49,801 --> 02:04:51,906
Such a child!
My mistake!

1584
02:04:59,967 --> 02:05:02,174
What the hell have you done!

1585
02:05:02,268 --> 02:05:04,475
We have to call the doctor!
Anybody there?

1586
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:07,540
Anybody there? Call an ambulance!

1587
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:10,540
We have to save him!
Is anybody there?

1588
02:05:11,067 --> 02:05:14,344
Leave me, I've to take him
to the hospital!

1589
02:05:16,434 --> 02:05:19,074
Yes Antara, we will!-
- No! We've to save him!

1590
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,402
Yes Antara!

1591
02:05:39,334 --> 02:05:41,041
Who is Antara Chakrabarty?

1592
02:05:41,134 --> 02:05:44,843
Antara is not mentally stable.
Tell me what you have to.

1593
02:05:44,901 --> 02:05:47,973
How was your relationship
with Mr. Alokesh?

1594
02:05:48,034 --> 02:05:49,536
Very healthy, Sir.

1595
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:53,843
Any fights problems between the
husband and wife in this house?

1596
02:05:53,901 --> 02:05:55,699
No. Happy family-

1597
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,678
Addictions? Gambling?

1598
02:05:56,734 --> 02:05:58,839
Alokesh was a simple boy.

1599
02:05:58,934 --> 02:06:00,743
No bad habits at all.

1600
02:06:00,834 --> 02:06:01,869
Yes

1601
02:06:02,234 --> 02:06:05,113
I and Antara were involved.

1602
02:06:05,767 --> 02:06:08,304
But no relationship can be
illicit.

1603
02:06:08,701 --> 02:06:10,908
The relationship of need.

1604
02:06:11,534 --> 02:06:13,309
I used to take advantage

1605
02:06:13,434 --> 02:06:17,712
I got Alokesh the job. In return I
used to exploit Antara physically.

1606
02:06:17,834 --> 02:06:19,643
You crazy bitch!

1607
02:06:19,701 --> 02:06:22,204
Ugly slut!-
- What is all this!

1608
02:06:22,301 --> 02:06:24,076
Killed him..
such a nice guy!

1609
02:06:24,234 --> 02:06:25,679
Quiet!

1610
02:06:25,767 --> 02:06:27,872
And this man should be hanged!

1611
02:06:28,001 --> 02:06:30,174
Both of them have
killed my friend!

1612
02:06:30,234 --> 02:06:31,907
Celebrity, my foot!

1613
02:06:52,467 --> 02:06:55,073
And what happened to Antu?

1614
02:06:56,434 --> 02:07:02,214
Antara lost her mental
stability due to her guilt.

1615
02:07:02,568 --> 02:07:06,015
And I took shelter,
at Koelphuli's...

1616
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:08,740
dilapidated beach

1617
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:14,872
Because of you, Alokesh died.
Antara went crazy.

1618
02:07:14,968 --> 02:07:21,442
Antu's uncles couldn't keep him any more
Sent him to a boarding school in Darjeeling

1619
02:07:22,601 --> 02:07:25,241
And what happened
to that Antu?

1620
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:30,271
He is finishing his college now.

1621
02:07:30,434 --> 02:07:34,507
He's waiting to be placed via
campus interviews.

1622
02:07:35,134 --> 02:07:40,277
He is in a relationship with
a sweet girl named, Shohag.

1623
02:07:42,834 --> 02:07:45,542
That you are Alokesh
and Antara's son,

1624
02:07:45,901 --> 02:07:50,077
I figured it out quite a
while ago, Rishabh.

1625
02:07:50,201 --> 02:07:55,549
When I saw Antara or Damayanti's
autograph book with Shohag.

1626
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:02,782
You inherited it and gifted
it to Shohag, right?

1627
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:09,273
The name 'Damayanti' must've
made it clear that I am..

1628
02:08:09,667 --> 02:08:12,204
Narrating the
story of your parents.

1629
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,742
I am exceptionally ignored
in your story.

1630
02:08:21,534 --> 02:08:23,514
I know that,

1631
02:08:24,001 --> 02:08:26,880
I must have to answer to you
one day.

1632
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:31,047
I've done you a lot of wrong.

1633
02:08:31,167 --> 02:08:36,640
According to you, every
action has a reaction

1634
02:08:40,567 --> 02:08:43,741
And every reaction has a revenge

1635
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:54,106
Another murder in the
city due to a love triangle?

1636
02:08:54,267 --> 02:08:57,737
Police says eminent author
of Bengali literature, Dhrubo Lahiri

1637
02:08:57,834 --> 02:09:01,509
aka Nirbed Lahiri's death
was due to an illicit love affair.

1638
02:09:14,167 --> 02:09:18,240
Freedom

1639
02:09:19,634 --> 02:09:23,104
The incident took place
today at <i>3</i> star hotel room.

1640
02:09:23,301 --> 02:09:27,374
Detectives say, the same affair made
him embrace exile for 20 years

1641
02:09:27,601 --> 02:09:32,778
today was the first time he came
to Kolkata from Koelphuli since then.

1642
02:09:36,467 --> 02:09:38,469
<i>'Witnesses say,</i> around <i>3:20 pm,</i>

1643
02:09:38,768 --> 02:09:44,184
the body fell from the 7th ﬂoor
breaking through the glass

1644
02:09:46,001 --> 02:09:49,881
I can guess the end of the story.

1645
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:54,578
I probably won't be able to
write it.

1646
02:09:54,901 --> 02:09:58,576
You must complete the novel.

1647
02:09:59,067 --> 02:10:03,880
I've a suicide note
at the end of the manuscript.

1648
02:10:04,267 --> 02:10:07,714
It's timed at 3 pm

1649
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:11,209
Rishabh might need it.

1650
02:10:11,401 --> 02:10:14,314
Nirbed Lahiri.

1651
02:10:18,367 --> 02:10:21,746
My love does not have a birth

1652
02:10:22,167 --> 02:10:24,613
It does not have a death too

1653
02:10:24,801 --> 02:10:31,844
Because I was born with diamonds of
another kind of love, etched into my body
