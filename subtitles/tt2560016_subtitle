00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,926
No. No. l won't take such a big risk.

00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:43,801
Excuse me.

They are taking Keshav
to a mental asylum. Damn !

So what about Keshav?

23
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,371
Yes.. - Justice for him.

24

Take justice from her.
l won't do this.

25
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,506
The ATS people are after my life.

26

28
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,378
You are still playing a game,
aren't you?

00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:10,752
lt's breaking news. After 1 5
minutes the news will be forgotten.

30
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,756
People will remember only our faces.

31
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:12,917
Will you be my body guard?
- There is a way.

32

lf we sensationalize it,
people will get curious.

36
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,266
And they won't be able to cover it up.

37
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,202
Right. - But how?

38
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:27,640

Sir, sorry. - What are you doing?

Brother, shame and pride
are two sides of the same coin.

110
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:17,284
When they don't have any pride,
why will they feel ashamed?

111

Still, what is this? Damn.

Mister, keep it closed.

The train is modern.
But the condition is the same.

Thank God at least something changed.

Hello! Have you seen the metro?

''..l am unaware of even myself.''

Sir, if you say,

You fool ! Will you get us killed?

152

To whom it has to be delivered?

153
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,626
Sir, Hussein. - Hussein.

00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,427
Contact him.
Tell him to hell with the payment.

Break his legs. He has gone crazy.

158

Hello.

249
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:35,525
Russell says..

250
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:40,594
''True happiness lies in treating..''

251
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,328
''..the whole world
as your own family.''

252
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,160
''With no expectation.''

253
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,369
''The whole world
is one single family.''

254
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,736
What is this Russell?

255
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,636
lt was written in 'Shrimad
Bhagwad Gita' (Holy book)..

256
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,576
..thousands of years ago.

257
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:57,414
''You have the right
to perform your actions.''

258
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,417
''But you are not entitled
to the fruits of the actions.''

259
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:02,920
But there is more to it.

260
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,182
Do you know that?

261
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:07,757

Good for you, sir.

270
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:28,344
You let it be.

271
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:33,907
Harbinder Singh.

272
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,416
Show me your lD.

273
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:40,191
Why only me?

274
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:42,352
The person whose house is raided..

275
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,553
..he asks this kind of question.

276
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,754
Don't ask too many questions from
lndian government's best employee.

277
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:48,822
Show me. Show me.

278
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:50,593

Yes. Yes. Fine.

Keep that down.
- Oh ! l will keep it down.

283
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,409
Don't worry about others.

284
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,611
Take special care
of the minister's wife.

285
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:09,181
He has gone.

286
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,923
'lf you tell papa about this..'

287
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:24,801
'..then..'

288
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:30,904
'And...
if you ever talk about leaving..'

289
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,439
'..then..'

290
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:41,909
'Did you understand?'

291
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:54,355
Dance bars. Roadside romances.

292
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,294
Besides law and order, our police..

293
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,204
lf we kill criminals,
civil rights violation.

294
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:05,308
lf we curb nuisance,
we are accused of moral policing.

295
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:06,344
What do you want?

296
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:09,874

And to top it all, Mr.
Yadav, your demand of transfer.

298
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:14,847
That's not fair.

299
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,355
His arrival has spread
terror in the underworld.

300
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,387
And we are feeling quite safe,
you know.

301
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,619
Why trial?

302
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,521
l want to know why the drama of trial?

303
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:29,226
Give the power of
judgment to the executor.

304
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,268
Am l right?

305
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:31,899
Give me the gun.
- Ma'am, do you agree?

306
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,868
Give me the gun.

307
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,305

But..

312
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,221
Power lies in the hands that hold it.

313
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:58,661
And it shouldn't go into wrong hands,
that's my job.

314
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,589
And everybody's safety lies in this.

315
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:08,697
Now l will sleep.

316
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:13,578

Yeah. lt was mind-blowing.

00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,379
No philosophy. - What?

Really?

321
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:26,754
Hello.

Shall we play a game?

324
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:33,725
What? 'Antakshari' (Musical game ).

325
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,267
lt's just a game, you know.

326

00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:41,939
We don't know anything
about each other.

328
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,309
As such, even our own..

You know.

00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:57,951
Reveal our secrets.

333
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,292
Won't you let me

'By keeping a few buttons
of the shirt open..'

355
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:11,722
'..a person's status doesn't change.'

356
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:12,456
'Exactly.'

357
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:16,767
'lf you like him so much, surely.
She will not mind it.'

358
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:20,635
'lf you like him, welcome.'

359
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,694
'Not my types.'

360
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:23,775
My secret.

361
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:26,508
Whore.

362
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:32,248
Hey! What are you saying?

363
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,685
Wow! Absolutely correct.

364
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:38,151
Really?

365
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:40,354
Oh, my.

366
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:43,792
'Passengers please pay attention.'

367
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:47,198
'Due to some technical fault,
the train has been halted.'

368
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:51,167
'Passengers are requested
not to disembark for their safety.'

369
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,768
Are you playing a game
or finding customers?

370
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,943
l knew it. ltem girls' reality.

371

Oh, please! l told you.

372
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,681
After the truth is revealed,
no taunts.

373
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:07,611
As it is, all of us
sell something or the other.

374
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,314
No. Keep this title for yourself.

375
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:11,887
How much?

376
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:14,288
How much what?

377
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,852
How much for you?

378
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,794
You guys can't digest other's truth.

379
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,597
What will you say about yourself?

380
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,465
As it is, l don't think you can..

381
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:30,439
He can...afford.

382
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,211
Yes. But l am not interested.

383
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:40,480
ln what?
ln me? Or in shelling out money?

384
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:43,252
Ma'am, it's my principle.

385
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:46,317
l have never ever paid for it.

386
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:50,954
You get it for free.

387
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,355
Maybe. So?

388
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:02,262
Maybe that's why Mark has called
marriage legalized prostitution.

389
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:04,734
lt is sex. But free.

390
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:11,815
Whatever.
A deal is better than a free deal.

391
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,677
Okay. Tell me honestly.

392
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:19,523
Such a glamorous job.
Still why all this?

393
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,658
lt increases my rate.

394
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:26,763
Anyway, guys. lt's just a game.

395
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:30,296
Why are you guys so afraid
of revealing your secret?

396
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:33,804
Come on. :ighten yourself.

397

Oh, no! - Sorry.

398
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,711
But duty first. - Always.

399
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:51,313
Mr. Yadav, it's not right
to win and leave. Not right.

400
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:52,788
Do l win or you guys lose?

401
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:57,661
lf a minister's father is travelling..

402
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,390
..even a common man is a suspect.

403
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:04,693
And for your information,
there is a photo in my office.

404
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:07,494
Not of a minister.
But of a common man.

405
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,807
Who seeks protection.

406
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,672
And it's my job to protect.

407
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:14,309

00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:26,148
With me. He has neither
knowledge nor values.

411
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:27,480
He speaks English. - Yes.

This is today's youth.

They belong neither
to east nor to west.

416
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,325
They have nowhere.. - Sir.

Who? What can l do for you, sir?

418
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,369

Sit here.

420
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:53,780

What the hell !

427

Passengers are never satisfied.

428
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,774
Should l make a
business coach for you?

429
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:32,346
Then? - Then the emperor
started attending meetings naked.

430
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:37,693
But one day when he
was walking on the street..

431
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:43,495
..a child screamed, ''Emperor is naked.
Emperor is naked.''

432
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:46,168
''Emperor has no clothes.''

433
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:54,637
You are..

434
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:02,445

That you are..

437
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,454
You show it to him.

What do you mean which one?

443
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,710
He or she?

444
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,318

445
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:36,345
Dirty gutter worm.

'l think the Englishmen
have marred your senses too.'

554
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:37,287
'Since childhood they used you.'

555
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,428
'l saved you from them.'

556
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:40,589
'What did you give me in return?'

Who?

564

You.

565
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,794
You don't speak about yourself.

566
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:16,891
Why do you keep asking about others?

567
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:30,379
Witch. - What?

568
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:32,410
What is this?

569

People like you..

570

What's your problem with girls?

571
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:39,587
Oh, God !

Take this. This is for you.
This is for your father.

00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,872
''l am in turmoil.''

587
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:33,910
So Bengali gentleman.

588
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,906
Will you smoke? - No, thanks.

589
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,410

''Yet there is distance.''

''That's my only complain.''

597
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:22,486
''l don't know how l will get solace.''

lt's nighttime.

607
00:46:56,827 --> 00:47:00,160
Sorry. Sorry.
Did l disturb you? You go to sleep.

608
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:01,426
Sleep.

609
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,772
Where did both of them go?

610
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:11,933
Something is fishy.

611
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:27,321
CCCCaaann l dddrrinnKkkk???

612
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:32,451
Not this. Yours. - Oh, God.

613

My God.

614
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,536
You guys are so lucky. You guys work.

615
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,165
And enjoy.

616
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,641
Why? You don't enjoy your work?

617
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,883
l have seen the designer's TV show.

618
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,308
l hate him.

619
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,518
You are jealous of him.

620
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,761
Praising his creation.

621
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:09,864
And mocking others.

622
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,168
As if we are naked.
And only he knows how to dress up.

623
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,240
That's how the world is, my friend.

624
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:23,409
ln this crazy world,
in a mental asylum.

625
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:25,808
Only crazy people are safe.

626
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,414
You drink whatever you want to drink.

627
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:30,813
Enjoy. We are one family.

628
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:40,928
You are the one who offered.

629
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,261
But you are the one who took it.

630
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:47,770
My wallet is in my jacket.

631
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:51,302
Bloody slut.

632
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:53,335
lt's a secret.

633
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:54,808
Whatever.

634
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:04,646
Hi.

635
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:18,891
Brother,
you don't drink everyday, do you?

636
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:20,501
Whenever needed.

637
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,469
Yes. lt's good.

638
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:28,370
How much?

639
00:49:31,749 --> 00:49:32,716
Oh, God !

640
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:44,559
Keep the change.

641
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:47,486
Okay.

642
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,331
You started it here.

643
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:55,464
Now he is not a freeloader.

644
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:04,839
So brother, how much did you spend?

645
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,218
How much will you take from me?

646
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:18,325
Mister, you are not my class.

647
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:20,891
Whore and class.

648
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:25,727
No, brother.
These days there is no shame.

649
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:27,800
lt's better to be shameless.

650
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:31,864
You never felt ashamed
to steal stories from others?

651
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:32,866
Why?

652
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,275
lf the producer asks,
l will have to give.

653
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:37,912
That's even worse.

654
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:39,710
Slavery is worse than theft.

655
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,648
lt's much better
than selling your body.

656
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,587
Yes. This dialogue
seems familiar. Right?

657
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:48,586
l sell my body.
You sell your conscience.

658
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,853
Heard it in films. Where else?

659
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:54,822
Anyway, both of you can be bought.

660
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,562
Promoting oneself is different?

661
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,728
Amazing !

662
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:03,701
What do you sell?

663
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:06,400
Death.

664
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,472
What, brother?

665
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:15,649
What did he say?

666
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:18,418
What attitude!

667
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:22,151
l don't know from where
they come to Mumbai !

668
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:23,393
Bloody parasite!

669
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:26,955
Both of you seem to be from Mumbai.

670
00:51:27,364 --> 00:51:29,855
Whatever! He is after all a parasite!

671
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:32,532
lf it wasn't for these kind of guys..

672
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:33,968
..Mumbai would be Shanghai.

673
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:34,765
Trust me.

674
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:38,833
But sir, palace cannot
be built on a graveyard.

675
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:44,180
Shanghai is built by eradicating
not ill people but illness.

676
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:45,311
Yes.

677
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,680
l think he is a terrorist.

678
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,310
No. He can't be a terrorist.

679
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:53,617
He might be anything
but not a terrorist.

680
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:56,519
Why? How do terrorist look like?

681
00:51:57,895 --> 00:51:59,487
Anything but police.

682
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:01,828
No. Not terrorist.

683
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:12,372
''Death is preordained.''

684
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:13,569
Excuse me.

685
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:14,542
Are you alright?

686
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:17,970
You seem sick.

687
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:22,216
Come.
- ''Death is preordained.''

688
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,918
''Why can't l sleep the whole night?''

689
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:34,159
''Death is preordained.''

690
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:39,835
''Why can't l sleep the whole night?''

691
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:20,004
''Earlier l would laugh
at the plight of my heart.''

692
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:25,507
''Now l don't find anything humorous.''

693
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:31,914
''Earlier l would laugh
at the plight of my heart.''

694
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:38,259
''Now l don't find anything humorous.''

695
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:45,457
''There is no hope.''

696
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:51,173
''No face do l see.''

697
00:54:27,778 --> 00:54:32,579
''The matter is such that l am quiet.''

698
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:43,760
''The matter is such that l am quiet.''

699
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:49,423
''Otherwise l can also speak.''

700
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,304
''There is no hope.''

701
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:02,905
''No face do l see.''

702
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:03,370
So, Dogra?

703
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:06,574
Sir, Delhi ATS say that
along with dummy arms..

704
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:10,304
..they even supply real
arms to the film industry.

705
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:11,873
Why didn't they nab them in Delhi?

706
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,348
The train departed before
they could get the news.

707
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:15,385
What do they have?

708
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,811
lt's not under our division.

709
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,755
Since when did you
become vegetarian, Dogra?

710
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:24,722
The scapegoat is coming. :et him come.

711
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:25,726
Did you understand?

712
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,388
To the minister's house,
in a short while.

713
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:08,904
'Passengers please pay attention.'

714
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:14,272
'Train number 1 2952 Delhi
Mumbai Rajdhani Express..'

715
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:20,473

You have still not eaten anything.

No, thank you, sir. l have
to reach the commissioner's office.

01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:38,213
Who is he? Doesn't he know
my parents are traveling in the train?

750
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:39,441
What is RPF doing?

751
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:41,283

Okay. - Thank you, sir.

754
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,128

759
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:07,501
Why will you do this?

What happened? - Oh, God.

761
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,460
This Yadav is a rude fellow.

762
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:35,334
His wife left him. Do you know?

763
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:37,600
Sir, whatever your orders are..

764
01:01:37,674 --> 01:01:38,572
Do one thing. - Yes.

765
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:41,166
Gather your entire team in
the railway control room. - Okay.

And you board the train. - Okay.

767
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:45,981
And don't take any action till
you get my order. - Sir, action..

768
01:01:53,856 --> 01:01:58,793
Such a man doesn't
value my parents' lives.

769
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:02,922
Why? - He is after me.

770
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,630
But for our party...he would be..

771
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:12,372
Don't worry. Don't be tense.

772
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:15,269
Don't worry? Don't be tense?

773
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:17,410
What are you saying?

774
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:21,008
All my bank accounts
are in my parents' name.

775
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:23,542
lf they die, we will be finished.

776
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,550
We will have to again
live in Dharavi slums.

777
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,182
Do you know?

778
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:29,650
Talking nonsense.

779
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:34,024
You forget.
You never take your medicines. - Come.

780
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:36,531
You always do this. Why? - Sit here.

781
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:41,093
You won't go out without one
of them accompanying you. - Fine.

782
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,262
Please. Okay?

783
01:02:48,544 --> 01:02:51,138
Don't move your hand. l will shoot.

790
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:22,072
Calling me terrorist!
What's the hurry?

791
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:24,707
The game has just begun.

No, brother.

Gun is meant for firing.

Why don't you ask me my status?

810
01:04:30,713 --> 01:04:34,240
Your body will reach Mumbai.
Ask my status.

811

Why don't you say sorry?
- Why don't you ask me my status?

Do you know what hurt is?

lt's a nice joke.

819
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:03,435

But no. People like

They were there. They are here.
And they will be there as well.

823
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,230
Since childhood they
have been asking me my status.

824
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:35,076
Ask my status. Ask.

Send a message to Surat
that Rajdhani won't halt there.

832
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,530
He says if the train halts,

833
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,502

So what?

What will you get by losing
everything and not gaining anything?

858
01:08:23,512 --> 01:08:24,479
What will you get?

859
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:27,272
People like us don't lose or gain.

860
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,717
Everything belongs to you.

861
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,688
Still, all of you...especially him..

862
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:40,420
..doing this in front of me,
it means a lot to me.

863
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:46,259
Had l known before, l would
have used this a long time ago.

864
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:54,304

We will have to stop Rajdhani, sir.

There is a lot of crowd on the tracks.

901
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:47,510
Just involve the minister.

902
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:50,077

Sir, you have to decide.

907

Your parents or the campaign
people on the tracks?

908

What are you doing?

909
01:12:18,647 --> 01:12:20,114
People are sitting on the track.

Why don't you stop the train?

911
01:12:21,283 --> 01:12:22,648

People who do that, they are helpless.

921
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:01,247
People who do it in the open.

922
01:13:01,523 --> 01:13:03,423
Does one display himself willingly?

923
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:07,960

01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:38,625
Okay. lt's alright.
Go inside the cabin. Go.

1060
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:40,524
You stay here. - Come.

1061
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,222
Come on. - Come.

1062
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:46,432
l am sorry. Please don't say
anything to the minister. - Come.

1063
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:53,566
Yeah.

1064
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:59,308
Sir, there is no bomb.

1065
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:03,042
What? - There is no bomb in the train.

1066
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,049
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

1067
01:24:08,356 --> 01:24:09,550
And the revolver?

1068
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:12,516
According to Delhi ATS
he was given a dummy bag.

1069
01:24:12,794 --> 01:24:13,988
FaaaKkkkeeee.

1070
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:24,663
Maybe he doesn't know.

1071
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,705
Maybe he doesn't know it's fake.

1072
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:28,072
Damn this minister's luck.

1073
01:24:30,512 --> 01:24:34,539
And...who else knows about this?

1074
01:24:35,016 --> 01:24:37,007
Besides us,
some officers in the department.

1075
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:38,677
TT and railway guards.

1076
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:46,485
Do one thing. Tell the TT
not to say anything to his senior.

1077
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:48,653
Okay? - Fine.

1078
01:24:49,597 --> 01:24:52,998
vAAAvvnn ddd yyyneeeessss, ttlhheeee rmmeeeedddiaaa sssslhhoouuuldddnn'tt
fffinn ddd oouuutt aaannyyynttlhhinn g. - sSSSuuurreeee, ssssirr.

1079
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:55,030
Okay? l will go meet
the minister right now.

1080
01:24:55,503 --> 01:24:56,492
Okay, sir.

1081
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:01,542
Ma'am, why is that so?

1082
01:25:09,117 --> 01:25:11,347
How? - Yes. What do l know who he is?

1083
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:14,081
He drank with me. He chatted with me.

1084
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:16,316
No problem. - What are you saying?

1085
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,525
lt's okay. - How will l know?

1086
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:20,685
You? One moment.

1087
01:25:20,762 --> 01:25:26,997
Please go to the pantry
and have refreshments.

1088
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:28,365
What happened? What happened?

1089
01:25:28,636 --> 01:25:30,126
You know what? - Yes.

1090
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,105
There is no bomb in his bag.

1091
01:25:32,173 --> 01:25:33,538
He was bluffing.

1092
01:25:33,608 --> 01:25:36,202
What are you saying?
- l was scared to death.

1093
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:38,337
But why?

1094
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:42,274
Power. Power. Power.

1095
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:46,384
Do you know?
When he entered the train..

1096
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,245
..he was very confused.

1097
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:52,157
Then for whatever reason,
when he took out the gun..

1098
01:25:52,494 --> 01:25:56,260
..he got the feeling
he also has respect.

1099
01:25:56,831 --> 01:25:59,959
Maybe...maybe now he
has got what he wanted.

1100
01:26:00,435 --> 01:26:04,235
You know,
respect, dignity, self-respect.

1101
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:08,599
The TT says it's a hoax.

1102
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,600
The police say it's not a hoax.

1103
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:12,172
What's going on?

1104
01:26:13,181 --> 01:26:15,240
This is not the new order file.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:26:15,316 --> 01:26:17,682
This is 24/3. - 24/3.

1106
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:19,715
The old order file
has disappeared. - Yes.

1107
01:26:20,021 --> 01:26:21,682
Good news, sir. l will inform him.

1108
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:27,453
Sir, it was a hoax.
The ammunition is dummy.

1109
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:28,996
What?

1110
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:31,356
Dummy?

1111
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,090
You said it?

1112
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,264
Deputy commissioner
Yadav is also here.

1113
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:44,272
Come on. :eave.

1114
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:45,403
Okay.

1115
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:50,447
Oh, God ! Thank God.

1116
01:26:52,654 --> 01:26:55,623
Now transfer all the
accounts in our names.

1117
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:57,248
Okay?

1118
01:27:15,543 --> 01:27:21,175
Mr. Yadav, you must also
be relieved to hear it's a hoax.

1119
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:23,978
Admit him in a mental asylum quickly.

1120
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:26,546
Mental asylum needs other people.

1121
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:30,020
Kill him. - What?

1122
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:31,617
Encounter.

1123
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:33,251
Why?

1124
01:27:35,129 --> 01:27:36,460
ls this something personal?

1125
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:42,032
Maybe you are forgetting that
a short while ago you took a decision.

1126
01:27:43,605 --> 01:27:45,573
To ignore stop the train campaign.

1127
01:27:46,241 --> 01:27:47,333
Oh, my!

1128
01:27:48,209 --> 01:27:49,506
Oh, God !

1129
01:27:51,579 --> 01:27:52,603
So?

1130
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:59,684
So? So is it right to run
the train over those people?

1131
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:01,653
What did l know at that time?

1132
01:28:01,723 --> 01:28:03,486
Will you go and explain to the media?

1133
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:06,987
l want to say only two things.

1134
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:09,756
Firrssssttlyyyn, ttlhheeee rmmeeeedddiaaa wwwwrill
ssssuuurreeeelyyyn sssseeeennssssaaattioonnaaalizzeeee itt.

1135
01:28:10,598 --> 01:28:14,432
Secondly, since when
did you become my well-wisher?

1136
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:20,172
At least you agree with me.

1137
01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:24,606
Firrssssttlyyyn,
ttlhheeee rmmeeeedddiaaa ccaaalleeeeddd lhhirmm aaa tteeeerrrroorrisssstt.

1138
01:28:25,146 --> 01:28:26,170
Not us.

1139
01:28:26,614 --> 01:28:28,275
And the media won't
sensationalize their mistake.

1140
01:28:29,484 --> 01:28:32,647
Secondly,
l am sure you must not have..

1141
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:35,112
..anything to do with my transfer.

1142
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,658
Next time you will meet
not deputy commissioner Yadav..

1143
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:41,589
..but commissioner Yadav.

1144
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:47,323
Thank you, sir.

1145
01:28:53,741 --> 01:28:56,175
Oh, my!

1146
01:28:59,547 --> 01:29:03,278
Sir...sir,
what if there is an inquiry?

1147
01:29:06,187 --> 01:29:07,211
Sorry, sir.

1148
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:10,614
Who gave us the permission?
- Minister, sir.

1149
01:29:12,126 --> 01:29:14,959
lf he would have negotiated,
his image would have got tarnished.

1150
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:18,255
Now whether someone dies or not,
he will get into trouble.

1151
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:20,596
What will he say to the public?

1152
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:21,692
Public.

1153
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:26,273
He gives us permission.
And public gives him permission.

1154
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,770
By giving him vote.

1155
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:33,577
Public is responsible
for their plight. Full circle.

1156
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:38,013
Hello. - The track is not empty.
What do l do?

1157
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,420
Thane line is busy, sir.

1158
01:29:42,123 --> 01:29:43,784
Tell them to divert the train.

1159
01:29:44,425 --> 01:29:46,052
vAAAvvnn ddd itt'ssss aaann oorrdddeeeerr. lNNNNoott aaa rreeeequqquuueeeesssstt.

1160
01:29:46,628 --> 01:29:47,686
Divert the train immediately.

1161
01:29:59,574 --> 01:30:01,132
What will he get by doing all this?

1162
01:30:03,077 --> 01:30:04,704
But it's not written
on somebody's face.

1163
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:06,137
Silence.

1164
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:09,708
This is Satyam Sharma, head TT.

1165
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:11,407
Yes.

1166
01:30:12,587 --> 01:30:14,953
What? What?

1167
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:18,086
Yes.

1168
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,119
This..

1169
01:30:23,498 --> 01:30:24,487
But..

1170
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:27,997
He..

1171
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:30,229
What happened, brother?

1172
01:30:30,304 --> 01:30:35,241
ATS doesn't want me to tell
my seniors about this incident.

1173
01:30:38,579 --> 01:30:40,046
Did you understand its meaning,
brother?

1174
01:30:40,648 --> 01:30:42,479
What? - End of the story.

1175
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:44,411
What do you mean?

1176
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,281
They will do his encounter.

1177
01:30:46,587 --> 01:30:48,020
No. - Yes.

1178
01:30:48,523 --> 01:30:50,320
But before that l will ask him once.

1179
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:51,653
What did he do with
me the whole night?

1180
01:30:53,594 --> 01:30:55,528
Have a seat. l will come. - But..

1181
01:30:58,766 --> 01:31:01,098
Mister! - Go ahead ! Shoot! Shoot!

1182
01:31:01,169 --> 01:31:02,227
What are you doing?

1183
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:07,436
Everybody knows. - What?

1184
01:31:07,709 --> 01:31:10,610
He is bluffing. - There is no bomb.

1185
01:31:11,112 --> 01:31:12,238
What? - Yes.

1186
01:31:12,313 --> 01:31:14,440
There are no bombs
and arms in the bag.

1187
01:31:17,618 --> 01:31:19,245
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1188
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,480
No! No! Stop!

1189
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,182
Stop!

1190
01:31:23,725 --> 01:31:24,749
Did you see? Did you see?

1191
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:26,184
lt has nothing.

1192
01:31:40,241 --> 01:31:42,471
'That's how the world is, my friend.'

1193
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:47,205
'ln this crazy world,
in a mental asylum.'

1194
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:48,509
'Only crazy people are safe.'

1195
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,016
Scoundrel !

1196
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:57,714
Boy! This guy is in
some serious trouble now.

1197
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,225
l will ask first.

1198
01:31:59,293 --> 01:32:00,555
What did you do with
me the whole night?

1199
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:03,521
Mr. Writer.

1200
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:04,958
CCCCaaann'tt yyynoouuu sssseeeeeeee???

1201
01:32:05,533 --> 01:32:07,228
What if there were bullets in his gun?

1202
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:08,495
Never!

1203
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:10,093
lf there were bullets in the gun..

1204
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:11,729
..he would have shot
you and not the floor.

1205
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:14,007
Whatever!
- 'Only crazy people are safe.'

1206
01:32:15,209 --> 01:32:16,506
Stop! - Get lost!

1207
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,180
Move. Move.

1208
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:28,381
He has gone crazy.

1209
01:32:29,724 --> 01:32:32,090
He has gone crazy. He has gone crazy.

1210
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,184
Drink water.

1211
01:32:33,561 --> 01:32:35,119
Mr. Sharma. Mr. Sharma.

01:32:35,563 --> 01:32:37,690

1213
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:39,426
Please connect me to the ATS.

01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:45,970
Once. Please.

Hello. This is Satyam
Sharma from Rajdhani Express.

Hello. Yes.

You talk. Go.

Hello. - l saw everything.

1226
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:14,499
We don't interact with
public during the operation.

1227
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:15,661
Give the phone to TT.

1228
01:33:15,736 --> 01:33:17,135
She says to give it to TT. - Give me.

1229
01:33:17,205 --> 01:33:18,502
She is not listening to me.

1230
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:22,339
l am a victim.

l will find out. Sure.

1232
01:33:26,013 --> 01:33:27,241
Sir, he is really insisting.

1233
01:33:30,484 --> 01:33:33,282
How will we know who
is he from the three of you?

1234
01:33:34,422 --> 01:33:38,483
As it is, if there is more
than one body, who will identify?

1235
01:33:40,428 --> 01:33:42,123
Yes. This is Satyam Sharma.
- What's happening?

1236
01:33:42,196 --> 01:33:44,289
He is saying he will
do our encounter. - What?

1237
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:46,356
He is saying we are together.

1238
01:33:46,434 --> 01:33:48,368
He is there.
You are there. l am there.

1239
01:33:48,836 --> 01:33:50,667
He is saying he will do our encounter.

1240
01:33:52,206 --> 01:33:53,366
Damn !

1241
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,167

1244
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,214
He said from all three of
us anyone can be the terrorist.

1245
01:34:02,283 --> 01:34:04,581
More than one body.
He will do our encounter.

1246
01:34:04,652 --> 01:34:07,280
Yours, his, mine.
He will do our encounter.

1247
01:34:07,355 --> 01:34:09,118
We will die.

1248
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:13,287
Damn ! - Where did the TT go?
TT.. - Who told you?

1249
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:15,221
Who told you to threaten them?

Brother, please calm down.

1254
01:34:22,136 --> 01:34:26,163
We...all of us are involved.
Nothing can be done.

You have connection

Yes. So? - Make a call.

1260
01:34:38,452 --> 01:34:39,544
No. - Make a call.

1261
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,315
No. - What do you mean no?

1262
01:34:41,389 --> 01:34:43,653
Not after what he has done.
Especially to me.

1263
01:34:44,091 --> 01:34:45,581
That's what l am saying.

1264
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,756
Make the call for yourself.
Your life is also in danger.

1265
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:52,126
Please. Do it. Make the call.

1266
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:54,565

Please keep quiet.

Oh, no! Ma'am has gone to
the station leaving her cell phone.

1269
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:09,207
Shall we answer it? - No.

1270
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:12,210
Please keep quiet.

Try once more. Please. Please.

1275
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:27,326
Brother, all of us will die.
Please do it.

1276
01:35:28,235 --> 01:35:29,634
Quiet!

1277
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:32,264
You keep quiet.

1278
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:38,570
l am sorry for the
inconvenience caused.

1279
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:40,238
We will take him out.

1280
01:35:40,748 --> 01:35:41,737

1282
01:35:48,622 --> 01:35:50,351
But the punishment of the
crime that he has committed..

1283
01:35:50,424 --> 01:35:51,721
..is not death.

1284
01:35:51,792 --> 01:35:52,986
Not at all.

1285
01:35:54,328 --> 01:35:56,159
CCCCoormmeeee. GGGeeeett uuuppp.

1286
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,595
Get up. Just get him arrested.

1287
01:35:57,665 --> 01:35:58,962
Wait! - Come.

1288
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,425
No. No. Justice.

1289
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:03,436
Do you understand justice?

1290
01:36:04,038 --> 01:36:05,403
Or you don't respect even justice?

1291
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:07,668
But this is a hoax, sir. We all know.

1292
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:09,903
Hand him to the railway guard.

1293
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:13,604
You are right.

1294
01:36:16,317 --> 01:36:18,649
The crime was committed in the train.

1295
01:36:19,787 --> 01:36:21,721
So the railway police
should arrest him.

1296
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:23,051
Yes.

1297
01:36:23,124 --> 01:36:25,149
Come on.
Open this door. Open it. Open it.

01:36:41,809 --> 01:36:43,572
l mean, all of us are witness.

1305
01:36:44,678 --> 01:36:46,202
Hello. - Do you know?

1306
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,510
Hello. - Yes.
- ATS is after all of us.

1307
01:36:48,582 --> 01:36:50,379
Yes. This is Satyam Sharma.
- l won't spare him.

He has gone crazy.
He is not in his senses.

1311
01:36:57,691 --> 01:36:59,283
You control yourself. - He..

1312
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:03,997
He has no control over himself.
And he is not a terrorist.

1313
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,030
He has been framed.
He will be killed in an encounter.

1314
01:37:07,101 --> 01:37:09,160
Scoundrel.
l will kill you. - What are you doing?

1315
01:37:10,538 --> 01:37:12,733
Will you give me a heart attack?
- Scoundrel.

1316
01:37:12,807 --> 01:37:14,035
Please calm down.

1317
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:19,379
Sir, a writer, a fashion designer.

1318
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:21,642
And he is acting crazily.

1319
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,698
Whatever is happening
is that right, sir?

1320
01:37:38,766 --> 01:37:40,256
He always stands for us.

1321
01:37:40,601 --> 01:37:42,193
He never lets us be a scapegoat.

1322
01:37:42,269 --> 01:37:44,169
How can you doubt such an officer?

1323
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,235
There is something called loyalty.
- Sorry, sir.

1324
01:37:50,377 --> 01:37:52,675
lt's better to believe
in sincerity than loyalty.

1325
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:54,303
What's the difference?

1326
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:56,749
:oyalty is for dogs.

1327
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:59,047
Sincerity is for humans.

1328
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,444

1331
01:38:38,058 --> 01:38:41,186
As per railway officers'
order Keshav is under arrest.

1332
01:38:41,762 --> 01:38:43,753
This incident happened in the railway.

1333
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:45,093
These are railway guards.

1334
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:46,793
They will hand him
over to the railway police.

1335
01:38:46,867 --> 01:38:48,801
This is under railway jurisdiction.

1336
01:38:49,537 --> 01:38:50,595

Hello.

1341
01:39:02,082 --> 01:39:04,073
The TT is talking about
railway jurisdiction.

1342
01:39:04,752 --> 01:39:05,946
Get me the clearance.

1343
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:07,743
Hurry up.

1344
01:39:09,523 --> 01:39:10,547
Yes.

1345
01:39:15,496 --> 01:39:17,726
Guards are outside.
l have informed them.

1346
01:39:18,032 --> 01:39:19,693
That Keshav is in our custody.

1347
01:39:19,767 --> 01:39:21,701
The railway police
have also been informed.

1348
01:39:22,369 --> 01:39:24,200
Sir, the guards are
superior to ATS, right?

1349
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:26,068
They are also lndian
government's employees.

1350
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,198
But what if they return?

1351
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:30,241
ATS has diverted the train. - Divert.

1352
01:39:30,311 --> 01:39:31,369
What difference does it make?

1353
01:39:31,445 --> 01:39:33,504
Take him away.
l don't want to die for him.

1354
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:35,742
Yes. The mere thought
of dying is terrifying.

1355
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:37,142
And another's death is spectacle.

1356
01:39:37,218 --> 01:39:38,480
Who provoked him first?

1357
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:41,385
You had started the
drinking competition.

1358
01:39:41,455 --> 01:39:42,786
Will you please stop your lecture?

1359
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:44,284
She is absolutely right.

He is talking about
railway jurisdiction.

You know what will happen

1374
