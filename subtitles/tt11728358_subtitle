"She is just gorgeous!"

192
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,042
"She's an absolutely gorgeous dog."

193
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:18,584
After a week of having her...

194
01:17:18,876 --> 01:17:20,000
...it was just...

195
01:17:20,584 --> 01:17:22,876
We're soulmates!
We're just...

196
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:25,125
She won't leave my side.

197
01:17:38,795 --> 01:17:41,295
[music swells]

198
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:01,529
[light traffic]

199
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:10,667
Scots are well renowned for
liking a dram, shall we say...

200
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:13,375
And I don't think that
will ever change!

201
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,417
There are many old stories...

202
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:18,334
...from moms and dads
from days before...

203
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:20,584
...where dads used to
walk out the door and say:

204
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:22,959
"Now I'm just gonna
see a man about a dog."

205
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:25,417
And that was code for:
"I'm going for a pint!"

206
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:31,021
[pub chatter]

207
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:02,083
She's come right outta her shell.

208
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:05,375
When I first took her to the pub,
for instance...

209
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,334
She'd just...

210
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:10,584
She'd just shake.

211
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,292
She'd just cower away
from everybody.

212
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:16,209
She wouldn't let anybody touch her.
She was never aggressive...

213
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:19,167
She was just scared.
Very, very scared.

214
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,083
But now you take her in...

215
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:23,417
...and she's just great with everybody.

216
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:25,709
And lots of people say that,
they say:

217
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:28,125
"Oh, look at the difference
in that dog!"

218
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,748
[crowded pub chatter]

219
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:48,756
[roar of anticipation]

220
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,919
[heckling and cheering]

221
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:00,876
The Scottish pub...

222
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:03,918
...has been a hub of the community...

223
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:05,500
...for a really long time.

224
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:07,459
And dogs have always
been a part of that.

225
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:10,959
And of all the places that
Kyra and I have lived...

226
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:14,250
Highland parts where you get snowed in,
eight feet of snow...

227
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:16,626
Sometimes quite unusual,
but it's always kinda exciting.

228
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,417
Because you knew
that was a good reason...

229
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:19,918
...to go and kinda stack
up in the pub.

230
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:21,709
People'd be throwing logs in the fire...

231
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:24,292
...and all the wet dogs'd be standing there,
steam coming off of them.

232
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:26,250
It was a great,
great atmosphere.

233
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:27,876
It still is,
it still does happen.

234
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:32,740
[busy pub chatter and laughter]

235
01:20:41,528 --> 01:20:43,404
[laughing]

236
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,982
[piano starts]

237
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:09,250
I'm gonna feed him a lot of
sirloin steak, and gravy...

238
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:12,334
...and we're gonna give him
loads of cuddles on the couch...

239
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,792
...and a few good hikes...

240
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,876
...and get some nice pictures.

241
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:19,250
And try not to cry too much.

242
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,375
I'm actually gonna really miss him.

243
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,292
I'm gonna have to...

244
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:30,751
...take up my running again or...

245
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:32,459
...keep myself busy.

246
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:37,000
We've always had dogs...

247
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,334
...in and out
of our lives constantly.

248
01:21:40,334 --> 01:21:42,459
But I think he's gonna be
the last one for a while.

249
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,083
I've discovered that they're just...

250
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,125
...so forgiving...

251
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:54,292
...and kind.

252
01:21:55,459 --> 01:21:57,667
What amazes me is...

253
01:21:58,042 --> 01:21:59,709
...when bad things have
happened to them...

254
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:02,709
...or when somebody's done
something terrible to them...

255
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:05,167
...they'll always trust
again, which...

256
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:08,334
...amazes me.
Totally amazes me.

257
01:22:10,474 --> 01:22:12,935
[pub chatter]

258
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:19,375
A relationship with
a dog is...

259
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,792
It's better than...

260
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,209
...any relationship you'll have with a human.

261
01:22:24,584 --> 01:22:25,792
In my point of view.

262
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,709
Don't be getting me wrong,
I love humans, but y'know...

263
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,375
Dogs are just...

264
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:32,709
They don't know
the bad sides.

265
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:34,834
They just know the good side.

266
01:22:35,626 --> 01:22:37,918
They just know their loyalty.

267
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:47,690
[credits music begins]
