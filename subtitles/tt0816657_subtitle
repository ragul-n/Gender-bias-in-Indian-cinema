1
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,658
"Yeah, bump and dance."

2
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:40,520
"Old school."

3
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:42,723
"One time."

4
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,364
"My beloved, want you by my side."

5
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,499
"Want you by my side."

6
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,170
"When my destination
is in front of me."

7
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,579
"I am losing control."

8
00:00:58,682 --> 00:00:59,706
"I am losing control."

9
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,409
"What a crazy ride."

10
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:02,542
"What a crazy ride."

11
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,450
"Such a journey has started."

12
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:05,579
"Such a journey has started."

13
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,624
"My beloved."

14
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,224
"My sweet heart."

15
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:26,775
"My heart has been
intoxicated by you."

16
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,211
"Since your eyes mesmerised me."

17
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:36,244
"What has happened since then?"

18
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,653
"On and on, till the break of dawn."

19
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,787
"I said.."

20
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,221
"I said.."

21
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:52,233
"I said, I love you.."

22
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:56,773
"My beloved, your presence
in my dreams."

23
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:01,811
"Your losing yourself, looking
for a false reason."

24
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:11,651
"My heart losing control, don't
trouble me like this."

25
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:16,259
"Since your eyes mesmerised me."

26
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:21,289
"What has happened since then?"

27
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:26,527
"My beloved, want you by my side."

28
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:27,661
"Want you by my side."

29
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,262
"When my destination
is in front of me."

30
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,674
"I am losing control."

31
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,645
"What a crazy ride."

32
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,283
"Such a journey has started."

33
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:41,544
"Bump and dance."

34
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,847
"My beloved."

35
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:53,387
"Beautiful!
- My sweet heart."

36
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,629
"My beloved."

37
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:02,895
"My baby!
- My sweet heart."

38
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,869
"My beloved."

39
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,500
Yes.
- It's done.

40
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:16,373
The secret of 20 seconds
is at last saved.

41
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:17,938
Thank you.

42
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:53,740
Taxi!

43
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:55,911
Yes dad, Sandy speaking!

44
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,877
This is my local number please
feed it in your mobile.

45
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:01,355
No need son, the next time
I will hear your voice..

46
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,689
..only when you will succeed
in your plans.

47
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:08,488
I will succeed dad, after
all whose son am I?

48
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,424
No matter how angry she is.

49
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,362
When she will see
me here in London..

50
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:13,766
..she will forget the past.

51
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,935
All the best son.
- Thanks dad.

52
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:19,874
You are an Indian, Sandy sir.
- Yes.

53
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:21,601
Sandeep Malhotra.

54
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,639
I am Iqbal Quershi, from Pakistan.

55
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:29,885
Seems like it is a matter of love.
- Yes.

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,917
You love her a lot.

57
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:36,550
But regretfully, I understood
that after she went away.

58
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,624
But the reasons to be angry
with a person like you?

59
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:41,962
It is a sonnet from your side.

60
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,557
What's the line?

61
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:49,770
"The people from the city was
crazy, I was a bit insane too."

62
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:56,475
"I made some mistake, and
some the world made me do."

63
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:07,521
Sid.
- Yeah!

64
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,491
Which jacket do you want darling?
- The black one.

65
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,556
They are all black.

66
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,129
Then the best one.

67
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:19,002
Bobby, it is 8:30 you
are still brushing.

68
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:20,501
Come on hurry up baby, come on!

69
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:22,630
Breakfast is ready guys!

70
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:25,439
You know Richa, I am sure
I am the world's only man..

71
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,978
..who cooks breakfast in the
morning for his wife and child. - Oh!

72
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,441
If I knew I would have to
do this after marriage..

73
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,846
..then I would have never
become a chef, right?

74
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,442
Baby, if I had known that I will
marry a professional chef..

75
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:40,080
..then I would have
never learnt to cook.

76
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:41,982
Some peanut butter?

77
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:46,017
I want to talk to you both
about something important.

78
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:49,530
Yes?
- I think I am going to get married.

79
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:51,825
What?

80
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:56,538
With whom?
- She studies in my class.

81
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:58,638
She is very beautiful, mom.

82
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,900
I think I have found my soul mate.

83
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,704
Soul mate?

84
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,947
Do you know the meaning
of soul mate, son? - No.

85
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,982
Then where did you hear
this word from son?

86
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,610
From papa.

87
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,648
Papa was saying soul mate
to someone on the phone.

88
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,557
Bobby, let us go to school.
We are getting late.

89
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:20,823
We will have breakfast
on the way, okay.

90
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:22,656
Let's go, let's go.

91
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,959
You wicked boy.

92
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,003
Sid, one minute.

93
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,571
Baby, don't forget football
practice. - Okay, Mom.

94
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:35,870
Just a minute darling.

95
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:41,675
What is all this?

96
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:43,910
What?

97
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,621
Who is your soul mate?

98
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:54,062
Richa, I was really going
to tell you everything..

99
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,226
What were you going to say?

100
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:04,839
I can't look at you
and say all this.

101
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,537
That's why I have written
everything down..

102
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,668
..and kept it in the microwave.

103
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,148
But please, read it after I leave.

104
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:16,176
Bye.

105
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,676
Okay, here we are.

106
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,045
You trapped me today, naughty boy.

107
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,172
Sorry.

108
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,014
Bye.
- Bye. Good day.

109
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,750
Yeah!

110
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,194
So, what do we do now?

111
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,824
Hello!

112
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:12,299
You take care of this, I will
take care of the rest.

113
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:21,741
Hi!

114
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:23,777
Hello gorgeous!

115
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,126
Hello my cookie jar!

116
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:35,697
There you are! There you are!

117
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:36,991
O God!

118
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,764
How did you know I was here?

119
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,866
Lovers know each others
credit card numbers too.

120
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,637
And your credit card numbers
and shopping habit..

121
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,771
..brought me here, my sweet pea.

122
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,643
Oh no! - One moment, one moment,
no fighting, no argument..

123
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:58,016
..no nothing. I have talked
to your mama and papa.

124
00:09:58,121 --> 00:09:59,645
As soon as we leave from here..

125
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:01,986
..we will get married grandly,
my cutie pie.

126
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,116
Marriage?
- Yeah!

127
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,727
How can you even think of that?

128
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,220
But I have already thought of it.

129
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,658
What are you? A spoilt
son of a rich father..

130
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,857
..who has still not grown up.

131
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,728
Who has no sense of responsibility!

132
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,794
What do you think,
marriage is a game?

133
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,771
For that..
- You have to grow up, isn't it?

134
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:19,799
I know.

135
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,778
Look, what I have written
for you 1000 times.

136
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:31,754
I will never be childish again.

137
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:38,760
"Don't be upset with
me, my darling."

138
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:43,799
"Please listen to me, beloved.
Please listen to me."

139
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,095
"I know I have made a mistake."

140
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,364
"But this heart belongs to you."

141
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:53,774
"Please don't torment it anymore."

142
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:56,336
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."

143
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,778
"Right now! Right now!"

144
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,811
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."

145
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:04,182
"Some how! Some how!"

146
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,778
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."

147
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,881
"Right now! Right now!"

148
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,793
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."

149
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,261
"Some how! Some how!"

150
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:39,319
"Don't create a scene."

151
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:43,882
"Have some shame."

152
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:49,230
"People will laugh at us."

153
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,356
"Think about it"

154
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:53,836
"There is time, think about it."

155
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,302
"You..
- Don't say anything."

156
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,000
"You..
- Stay away."

157
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,839
"You..
- Enough, come on."

158
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,108
"The nights are beautiful
because of you."

159
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:08,844
"It's a night filled with stars."

160
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:13,888
"It is such a beautiful
night, come on now."

161
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:16,851
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."

162
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,019
"Right now! Right now!"

163
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,388
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."

164
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,490
"Some how! Some how!"

165
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:34,375
"How can I trust you?"

166
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:38,914
"Who knows what's true
and what's not."

167
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:44,443
"The stars and the moon
may speak for you."

168
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:49,082
"But still the heart doesn't agree."

169
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,489
"Heart..
- Don't say anything."

170
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,893
"Heart..
- Stay away."

171
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:58,431
"Heart..
- Enough, come on."

172
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,904
"The heart trusts me, then
why are you refusing."

173
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,909
"I am where you are, my darling."

174
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,907
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."

175
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:14,006
"Right now! Right now!"

176
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,980
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."

177
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,248
"Some how! Some how!"

178
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:21,923
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."

179
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,016
"Right now! Right now!"

180
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:26,921
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."

181
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,261
"Some how! Some how!"

182
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,196
Keys in there.

183
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,007
Good morning!
- Good morning Sasha!

184
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,399
Good morning!
- Morning!

185
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:19,276
Morning boss!
- Morning!

186
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,574
No gum today?

187
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,077
No, I didn't take underground
today. Came by the bus.

188
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,154
Hurry up, the grand
boss has called you.

189
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,017
Pam, why do you call
him the grand boss?

190
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,521
What else should I call him? You
are my boss, and he is your boss.

191
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:31,992
So he is the grand boss.

192
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,925
But if you see his temper today..

193
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,292
..you will call him grand boss too.

194
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:37,992
Why, what's the matter? - Seems
like you will be promoted today?

195
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:42,932
Really? - If grand asks for someone
10 times within half an hour..

196
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,030
..then think it is time of trial.

197
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,941
Seems like grand boss
is going to send you..

198
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,103
..on a big mission, if you get
success in such a mission then..

199
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:53,011
Boss, all the best.

200
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:57,080
Morning James.
- Morning Sid, bad times.

201
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:01,114
Here.
- What's in it?

202
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:05,317
A few days back, our covert
MI6 agent from Malaysia..

203
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:09,023
..Kuala Lumpur, sent us
this code in his e-mail.

204
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,393
He didn't understand the sender.

205
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,967
He didn't understand the code..

206
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,093
..but it came as a red signal alert.

207
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:18,339
An SOS channel, Sid, you know what
that means? An eminent danger.

208
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:21,136
Danger to whom?
- To us.

209
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:27,310
It was sent to our agent.

210
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:31,044
MI6 thinks there is a possibility
of a terrorist attack in London.

211
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,526
I sent the message to the Mossad,
Russian intelligence..

212
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:44,065
..ISI and FBI, but I want MI5 to
be the agent to crack this code.

213
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,064
Yes, yes I can understand.

214
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,366
You have just shifted.

215
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,606
It will take sometime
to settle down.

216
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:02,177
I will get your son admitted
in my school.

217
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,145
No, Mrs. Mehra, I am
a science teacher.

218
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,249
Yes.

219
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,292
I will try to take some time out.

220
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:23,732
Siddharth stays busy.

221
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,404
You.. hello!

222
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:45,311
Peek-a-boo!

223
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:12,670
5400766600..

224
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:15,646
..EQUINOXA.

225
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:16,810
Is this a code or a book?

226
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,584
Come on, Pam! We have to crack this!

227
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:21,723
MI6 says that there might be some
terrorist attack on London.

228
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,282
We have to stop it!

229
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,659
Why are you doing this
to me? Who are you?

230
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,793
And what do you want from me?

231
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:34,759
Look, you might not be knowing but
I am a British citizen! Okay!

232
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:36,567
My one complain and your..

233
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:47,409
Equinox A! Equinox A! Equinox A!

234
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:49,548
That's right! Equinox!

235
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,186
Equinox A!
- Equinox is the day which comes..

236
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:54,813
..in the middle of summers
and winters.

237
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,288
Equinox!

238
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:00,259
It's just till the evening.

239
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,423
As soon as the night falls..
your life will become bright.

240
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:08,694
I promise. We will release you.

241
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:15,608
But till then.. if you scream..
then before the night falls..

242
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,379
..I will have to kill you!

243
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:22,912
Look.. you people are mistaken!

244
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,583
You people won't benefit anything
by kidnapping me!

245
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:26,948
I am a school teacher!

246
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,689
I don't have any money
to give to you all!

247
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,554
I have loads of money!

248
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,353
But not a husband like Siddharth!

249
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:38,391
He too can't do anything! He
is a chef in a restaurant!

250
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:40,427
Equinox!

251
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,302
Meaning when day and
night are equal.

252
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,874
That's right! - And it happens
only twice in a year!

253
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,803
23rd March and 22nd September!

254
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:55,542
23rd March spring! And autumn!
A is for autumn!

255
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:58,482
Equinox A! - Meaning 22nd
September! - That's right!

256
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,845
Something is going to happen
on 22nd September, Pam!

257
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:04,622
Boss.. boss! Today
is 22nd September!

258
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,419
Oh my God!

259
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,326
Your husband is an MI5 agent!

260
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:11,661
He works for the most
secretive agency here!

261
00:20:13,736 --> 00:20:14,760
What?!

262
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:17,972
Now I understood! Look!

263
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:21,536
You people have abducted me
mistaking some other Siddharth.

264
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:24,340
It's a.. it's a case of
mistaken identity! Okay!

265
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,451
Look! Look! His name
is Siddharth Verma!

266
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,789
And my name is Richa! Richa Verma!

267
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:42,829
And all this.. that you
are doing, its wrong! I..

268
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:54,366
This time I have disconnected
the phone!

269
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:57,737
Next time it will be your voice!

270
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:04,652
Hey, Sid! Someone must
have been in your car!

271
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:06,547
Your alarm has gone off!

272
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:09,687
What crap! Coming! Just work
on this! I will just come!

273
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,757
Yeah! - I will be right
back! - Yeah! Okay!

274
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,511
Hello!
- You have stopped this alarm!

275
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:35,850
But the alarm of your death..
only I can stop that!

276
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:37,476
Who are you?

277
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,420
Relax, captain! Relax! I am not
an enemy! I am your friend!

278
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:45,424
Mr. Siddharth Verma! Head
of co-ed operation.

279
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,695
MI5. England.

280
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,023
Open your car's trunk!

281
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:13,613
You scoundrel! How dare you!

282
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,580
You don't know what I can do!

283
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:17,759
I know, that why
I have chosen you!

284
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:21,622
The work which we want to do..
only you can do it.

285
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:25,461
What do you want?
- Relax, captain! Relax!

286
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,866
I am there! I will
explain everything!

287
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:31,631
The dustbin is in front.
Go towards it!

288
00:22:32,842 --> 00:22:34,742
Break the CD and throw
it in the dustbin!

289
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,574
Bad! Bad! Very bad!

290
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:47,485
I said to break the CD and throw it!

291
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Very good!

292
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:14,111
Now sit in the car! And head
towards Kensington Road!

293
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:19,612
Let me go!

294
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:23,650
Open it! Damn it!

295
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,056
For God's sake! Listen to me!

296
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,160
Sanjana! My sweet pea! My honey bun!

297
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,999
Where are you going?
Hang on! Oh God!

298
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:15,577
Dial tone!
- Sandeep, please!

299
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,201
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!

300
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,012
Listen to me for the last time!

301
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,510
After that if you want, then
you can shut this door..

302
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,107
..on my face forever!

303
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:25,077
Come on!

304
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:34,589
Tell me!
- Accept my gift! - Gift?

305
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,528
Yeah! Because I know that
seeing this gift..

306
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,658
..your anger will abate!

307
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,066
And you will come
running in my arms!

308
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:44,096
Impossible!

309
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,164
Very possible, sweetie!

310
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,606
Sandy, what are you doing?
- Very possible!

311
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,701
Now just stay put!

312
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:53,681
Come on! Come on!

313
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,009
What are you doing?

314
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,776
I am increasing the suspense,
darling!

315
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:05,150
Just wait here for me! I will
be back in a jiffy! Okay!

316
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,965
So all the problems are solved!

317
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:23,136
1234..

318
00:25:24,347 --> 00:25:26,645
569..

319
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:31,743
3456789..

320
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:38,717
Yeah!

321
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:43,091
Hello! Pathara restaurant!

322
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:44,824
Pathara what?

323
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,959
I am trying to reach Siddharth
Verma! Please help me!

324
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:51,673
No! I am not a chef! I am a
computer engineer! So bye-bye!

325
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:54,709
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Please!
I need your help!

326
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,801
My help? Didn't you find anybody
else in the morning?

327
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,837
Please, ma'am! Please! Goodbye!
Wrong number!

328
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,678
Hello! Please don't disconnect!

329
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,342
You.. you are an Indian!
- So?

330
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,018
Look, please.. I am
in grave trouble!

331
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,750
Right now my problem
is graver than yours!

332
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,790
In fact my girlfriend
got angry with me!

333
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,226
And leaving your and my India,
she has come here!

334
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,822
Please disconnect!

335
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:18,690
So that I can entice her and
take her back to India!

336
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,134
No, no, no! Please
try to understand!

337
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,962
Somebody has kidnapped me!

338
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,702
Kidnapped you? This is a good one!

339
00:26:25,841 --> 00:26:28,002
And after kidnapping you
they gave you the phone!

340
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,204
And said you can call all
the Indians for help!

341
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,077
Okay! Very nice! But I don't
have time to waste!

342
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:36,208
Okay! Thank you very much!

343
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,252
Please! Please don't disconnect!
Please!

344
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,822
Look.. they have broken the phone.

345
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,655
With great difficulty I
have joined the wires..

346
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:43,884
..and dialled this number.

347
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,927
If the phone got disconnected
then maybe again..

348
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:57,730
You want to talk to your wife,
don't you? Talk to her! -Sid!

349
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:01,402
Siddharth!
- Richa! Richa, are you okay?

350
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:04,302
Siddharth, look they have
brought me here by mistake!

351
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,749
And they are saying that
you work for MI5!

352
00:27:07,883 --> 00:27:09,874
Sid, tell them that you are
a chef in a restaurant!

353
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:12,310
Richa, do you know any of them?

354
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:13,846
Obviously not, Sid!

355
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:15,751
And we don't have anything
to do with all this!

356
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,687
You.. why don't you say.. what
they are saying about you..

357
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:19,852
..its all wrong..

358
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:22,292
I mean..
- I will explain all that later!

359
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:23,763
Right now listen to me carefully!

360
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,766
Carefully observe everything
around you, inside and out!

361
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,796
And tell me whatever you see!

362
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,834
I want to know where
they have hidden you!

363
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:33,274
Old buildings! Stable like place!

364
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,706
There is no building around!
There is a lake nearby..

365
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,834
..and mountains behind..

366
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:39,371
Hello! Hello!

367
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:43,842
Hello!
- Relax, captain! Relax!

368
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,878
You have spoken to your wife!

369
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:48,721
But the next time if you
tried to be smart..

370
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,349
..then it will be your
last conversation.

371
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,786
Now turn the car towards your bank.

372
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:55,823
You are going to regret
this! -Don't talk!

373
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:56,989
Just listen!

374
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,728
You will receive the rest
of the instructions..

375
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,096
..on reaching Barclays bank.

376
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,861
Oh no!

377
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:06,198
Hello!

378
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:12,143
I heard everything. I believe you.

379
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:13,906
What do you want me to do?

380
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:17,116
Police station! Please go
to the police station!

381
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:19,252
And let me talk to some
police officer.

382
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:22,821
And listen don't let this call
get disconnected. Okay?

383
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,217
Okay.

384
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:28,490
Good that I was there, Mr. Sandy.

385
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,889
But the matter reached
to the police station!

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,024
Iqbal, hurry up! Please!

387
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:35,996
By the way.. what's your name?

388
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:40,834
Richa! Richa Verma! I am a science
teacher in St. Joseph.

389
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:43,308
Okay! I am Sandy! Sandeep!

390
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:45,370
Just a second.

391
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:47,839
Oh no!

392
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,384
Hi, sweetie! What are you doing?

393
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:52,852
Shut up! Where are you?

394
00:28:53,522 --> 00:28:55,217
Here only?
- Where?

395
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,859
In the cab!
- In the cab?

396
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,859
I will be there within half and
hour and tell you everything!

397
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:04,990
Half and hour?!

398
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,863
You said two minutes and you have
vanished for half an hour!

399
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:08,402
Now you are saying half an hour!
So maybe now you won't come!

400
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:12,268
Yes! I was coming to you!
But Richa interrupted..

401
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,864
Richa! Who is Richa?

402
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:16,876
I will come and explain
everything, doll!

403
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,877
Whether you meet Richa or Ayesha!

404
00:29:19,114 --> 00:29:20,911
I don't have anything
to do with you!

405
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,811
I should have understood
before only..

406
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,180
..that you haven't come
to London for me!

407
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:28,014
I am leaving the hotel!
- But where?

408
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,483
I won't make the mistake
of telling you that!

409
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,154
But listen to me!
- Bye!

410
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:34,987
Bye!

411
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,922
Oh no! Hello, Richa!

412
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,895
Hello. Yeah! I am waiting!

413
00:29:40,102 --> 00:29:41,194
Don't worry! I am on my way!

414
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,361
Okay!

415
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,919
No! Listen.. listen..

416
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:05,020
You have to understand. This is my..

417
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,252
Hello!
- Go to the cash counter.

418
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:14,092
Come on! Move!

419
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,395
There is a queue!

420
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:19,998
You are MI5 agent! Who can stop you?

421
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:22,474
I am just a chef! Nobody knows me!

422
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:24,236
We will have to wait!

423
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,493
But I want my money now!

424
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:43,226
I have told you, sir!
We can't get it today!

425
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,967
This cheque is for
23rd of September!

426
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,433
And today is the 22nd!

427
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:50,264
This is my employment cheque!
I don't have any money!

428
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,471
Sorry, sir! We can't do anything!

429
00:30:54,343 --> 00:30:55,367
Go to hell!

430
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:11,424
What does she thinks of herself!

431
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,528
Morning!
- Good morning!

432
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:22,995
Would you like to make a100 pounds?

433
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:26,632
What?

434
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,205
Have you reached? -Yeah, Richa!

435
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,540
I am just entering the
police station now!

436
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:16,152
Hang on! Excuse me!

437
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:31,368
Excuse me! I need to speak
to somebody in charge!

438
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:32,497
Inside please!

439
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:41,139
Excuse me, officer!

440
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:44,118
I am here to help this lady!
She has been kidnapped!

441
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,186
Excuse me! Can I disturb
you for a minute?

442
00:32:46,288 --> 00:32:47,380
If you are not too busy!

443
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:50,190
Kidnapped? How do you know her?

444
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:56,424
Actually I don't. But I do.
I just got to know her.

445
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,492
But how do you know
about the kidnapping?

446
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:02,160
Good question!

447
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,136
She told me. She is on this phone.

448
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,430
Please talk to her!

449
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:08,401
We have waged a bet!

450
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,577
Monica says that you are enough.

451
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,441
And I think that just you won't do.

452
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:18,381
Why didn't she call us
and she called you?

453
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,119
It's complicated! Why don't
you just talk to her?

454
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,185
Hello!

455
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:33,599
He says that just you are not
enough to scare your husband.

456
00:33:33,702 --> 00:33:34,726
Hello!

457
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:40,665
And I say that what we want him
to do.. he will do it so easily..

458
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,471
..that for that your son..

459
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,679
What's his name? Yes! Bobby!

460
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:50,412
What's the need of bringing
Bobby here?

461
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,543
No!

462
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:56,619
Hello! Hello!

463
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,457
There is nobody!
- Just leave him alone! Okay!

464
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:07,167
Officer! I am sure she is there!
Her name is Richa Verma!

465
00:34:09,204 --> 00:34:12,799
Richa Verma! Please don't be
afraid! This is a police officer!

466
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:15,642
Hello! Please speak up!

467
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:18,177
Poor Bobby.. must be tense alone.

468
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:20,338
Mummy is here!

469
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:25,710
Papa is running about for our work!
Who will look after him?

470
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:30,815
I will do one thing! I will
bring him here from school.

471
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:33,786
You can help him in
his homework here.

472
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,693
And we will get our work
done by your husband.

473
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:39,198
Please don't drag my
son in this! Please!

474
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:40,427
Sorry! For disturbing you!

475
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:44,262
Please!

476
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:47,333
Are you trying to fool me?

477
00:34:47,442 --> 00:34:50,707
No, no, officer! I promise she
was on this line! Just..

478
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:52,770
Take this phone and get lost!

479
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:54,272
Hello! Richa!

480
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,584
I said get out!

481
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:03,655
Isn't it your responsibility
to help people?

482
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:05,226
I mean aren't you guys the police?

483
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,318
You guys! You guys are
making a mistake!

484
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:10,590
I swear! My sweet girlfriend! She
was on that line! -Come on! Let's go!

485
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:17,765
Hello! Hello!

486
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:19,636
We don't want to see
you again! Okay!

487
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:20,799
Mr. Sandeep!

488
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,575
Now where do you want to go?

489
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:33,786
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

490
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:37,258
Thank you! Thank God! You spoke!

491
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,417
I am sorry, Sandy!

492
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:40,185
What sorry? Because of you I have..

493
00:35:40,295 --> 00:35:42,320
..angered my girlfriend
and come here!

494
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,557
And you didn't even
talk to the police!

495
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:46,324
For the first time I
have been kicked out!

496
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:50,298
Sandy, they had come in the room.
I couldn't talk in front of them.

497
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:52,669
Sandy! I am sorry! Please
try to understand!

498
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,277
Now what do you want?
- My child..

499
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:57,640
Sandy, my child!
- Child!

500
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,278
Now from has this child come?

501
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:01,372
They are going to kidnap
him from his school!

502
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,507
Sandy, my child..

503
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:03,877
Go to the police!

504
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,344
The police won't believe me!

505
00:36:06,488 --> 00:36:08,718
Just 2 minutes ago I was talking
about saving a woman!

506
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,223
If I said anything about saving a
child.. then they will lock me up..

507
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:12,759
..thinking I am insane!

508
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:14,385
So you go to the school!
- Me?

509
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:17,427
Yes! Reach there before
them and pick up Bobby!

510
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,427
Please, Sandy! Don't think!
For Christ's sake!

511
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,298
The school will get over
after half an hour!

512
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:25,698
Don't let them get hold of
my child! Sandy, please!

513
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:27,732
Where is the school?

514
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,307
Delwar school! Delvich!

515
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,436
Bobby studies in class G2!

516
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:35,413
And yes.. he has a red
colour Spiderman bag!

517
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,876
Please, Sandy! Go there quickly!

518
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:39,377
They are very dangerous people!

519
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,319
If they got hold of Bobby, then I..

520
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:43,357
Fine! I will try! But
please don't cry!

521
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:45,621
Iqbal! Let's go!

522
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,264
Hello!
- Boss..

523
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,731
..where are you? You
just disappeared!

524
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,768
I even called at your home!
It's not reachable!

525
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:57,668
Pam, somebody has kidnapped Richa!

526
00:36:59,474 --> 00:37:01,806
What! - I think it's connected
to that code!

527
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:05,345
But boss, we have still
not cracked that code!

528
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,679
Listen, you don't worry.
I will talk to chief.

529
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,375
We will not let anything
happen to Richa! Okay!

530
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:10,508
No! Don't do that!

531
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,285
Till the time I don't finish
this kidnapper's task..

532
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:14,651
..he won't harm her.

533
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:16,686
What does he want?
- I don't know!

534
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,292
I just know that he is doing..

535
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:20,452
..all this with complete planning!

536
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:22,354
He has an eye on my each movement!

537
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:24,292
Right now if I involved MI5..

538
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:27,425
..then Richa's life can
be really in danger.

539
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:29,662
Okay! Okay! What do
you want me to do?

540
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,370
Just try to crack the
code immediately!

541
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:35,405
I am going to Bobby's school.
They might go there.

542
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:38,637
How far away are you
from the school?

543
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:42,415
Around.. Iqbal, how much
time will it take?

544
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:44,683
Sandeep, there will be heavy
traffic in city centre.

545
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:45,810
It will take 25 minutes.

546
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:47,854
25 minutes!
- Oh no! ..

547
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:50,448
The school will close
after 15 minutes.

548
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,422
What if they reached
there before you?

549
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,960
So what can I do in this, Richa?

550
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:58,556
Hang on! I will do something!

551
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,400
Sanjana, where are you, darling?

552
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:04,402
I have kept your luggage
in the room!

553
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,438
And I am going to keep
my luggage in the cab!

554
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:08,400
Very good! Very good! Come in a cab!

555
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,740
Take a cab and quickly
reach Delwar school!

556
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:13,780
What! - Yes! It's around 10
minutes away from there!

557
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,406
I am not going anywhere!

558
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,417
My dear, go quickly! The child's
life is in danger!

559
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,512
Child? Whose child?

560
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:22,647
Richa's child!

561
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,419
Oh! Now Richa has a child too!

562
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,992
What else are you hiding from me?

563
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,731
I will come and explain
everything, Richa!

564
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:33,764
I mean, Sanjana! Please
help me, darling!

565
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:35,626
Look, the child's name is Bobby!

566
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:38,796
He studies in class 2G! - And he
has a red colour Spiderman bag.

567
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:40,704
Okay! Please..
- Go to hell!

568
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,443
Iqbal.. I think we will
have to do something.

569
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:49,882
Richa, don't worry. We will get
there as soon as possible.

570
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:53,454
Sandy.. what's her name?

571
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:54,946
Sanjana.

572
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:57,682
I have put you into trouble, right?

573
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,753
But your trouble is
bigger than mine.

574
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:03,896
Don't worry. I will get there
as soon as possible.

575
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:08,560
Excuse me!
- Yes!

576
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:11,464
I need a cab!
- Where would you like to go?

577
00:39:11,573 --> 00:39:12,938
The Highpark Hotel. -Yeah!

578
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,531
That's fine! Just give me
2 minutes please! - Okay!

579
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:18,477
Yes, sir! We can have
a driver at 3 p.m.

580
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,571
If that's okay with you.

581
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:26,485
Actually I would like to go
to Delwar school please!

582
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:35,825
The road is blocked!

583
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,995
Oh no! Any other way?

584
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,067
There is. But we will have
to take a longer route.

585
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:41,928
Yes! There is a shortcut!

586
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:43,800
If you ran, you will reach
there within 5 minutes.

587
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:47,500
Fine, Iqbal. You bring the cab to
the school. I will meet you there.

588
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:48,633
Right, sir!

589
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,603
What's going on, Sandy?

590
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:52,873
The road is blocked ahead, Richa!

591
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:55,516
I will try to run to the school!

592
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:56,948
Oh my God!

593
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,517
Yes! Pray that I reach
there before them!

594
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:01,986
Hurry up! Hurry up, Sandy!
Please hurry up!

595
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:52,006
Excuse me. Which way to G2?

596
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,937
It's that way! On the left!
- Thank you!

597
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,224
Leave me!

598
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:28,968
Leave me!
- Richa, I found him! - Leave me!

599
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:31,669
I am your new friend!
Talk to your mother!

600
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:32,933
Hello!
- Hello, Bobby!

601
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,099
Are you okay, son?

602
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:36,768
Yes, I am okay, mom!

603
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:39,775
Okay! Listen to me carefully! Okay!

604
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:43,676
Today mama has to go out for
some very urgent work.

605
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:48,719
So mama can't come to pick you
up. Stay with uncle. Okay.

606
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:50,222
Yes, mama. I will stay with him.

607
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:55,129
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

608
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,254
What are you doing here?

609
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,755
I have come to pick up the child!
-When you could come, ..

610
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,890
..then why did you call me?

611
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,700
I couldn't have managed.
But I have come.

612
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,735
What you can't do, you do that!

613
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:05,702
And what you should do,
you can't do that!

614
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,035
Sanjana, you just listen
to me for a second.

615
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:08,234
Dear, give me a second.

616
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:11,709
Look.. I was 25 minutes
away from here.

617
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:13,144
And you were 10 minutes away.

618
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,771
Obviously you would have
reached before me.

619
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,716
And obviously.. - I will come
to pick you up by night. Okay.

620
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:18,843
Sunshine, please listen to me!

621
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,011
I love you, Bobby!

622
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:22,155
I have reformed! I have reformed!
I have reformed!

623
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,119
I have completely reformed,
my apple pie!

624
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,784
Now know one thing.

625
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:30,988
No matter what happens.. henceforth
I won't leave you.

626
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:32,726
Not even for another woman's child?

627
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,096
Who woman? Who..

628
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,271
Hello! Hello! Hello!

629
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:42,169
Hello, Bobby! Bobby!

630
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:44,806
Sandy! Hello! Hello!

631
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,804
Hello!

632
00:43:49,784 --> 00:43:51,843
Sandy! Sandy!

633
00:43:53,822 --> 00:43:55,687
Sandy, where are you going?
- Hello! Hello! ..

634
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,848
..Hello, Richa!
- Where is Bobby?

635
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:58,916
Sorry! Sorry! There was a blunder!

636
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:00,253
But I am following them!

637
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:02,761
But where is he?
- They are taking him in the car!

638
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:05,090
Taking him! So what are you doing?

639
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:15,134
How did they take him
when you were there?

640
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,801
Why didn't you stop them?

641
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,114
What is going on?

642
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:33,092
Hey! Hey! You! Hey you! Scoundrel!

643
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:34,852
Hell!

644
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,154
Hello!

645
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:40,127
Richa! Richa! Hey you!

646
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:48,271
You must have heard
your wife's screams!

647
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:50,934
You people said you won't touch her!

648
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:53,240
We also said that you
won't betray us!

649
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:57,750
Within 10 minutes if you
didn't reach the bank..

650
00:44:57,852 --> 00:45:01,879
..or if you tried to act smart..
I will shoot her.

651
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:06,918
Hello! Oh no!

652
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:09,887
Hey!

653
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:13,224
Knight bridge.
- Out of the question!

654
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:15,836
It's an emergency! My wife's
life is in danger!

655
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:17,268
I have to reach to the bank!
Please! -So go to the hospital!

656
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:20,170
Why do you want to the bank? - Why
do you want to know? You drive!

657
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:21,299
You don't understand!
The meter is down!

658
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:22,842
I am waiting for the passenger!
The fare is to be taken!

659
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:23,968
I will pay for it! Get in!

660
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:26,142
Every Indian is in a hurry!

661
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,410
Hello! Where are you? God damn it!

662
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:47,925
Hello!
- Hello!

663
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:49,495
Hello! Richa!
- Yes!

664
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:53,237
Richa, no need to worry! They
are right in front of me!

665
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:57,274
Don't lose Bobby, Sandy!
Don't lose him!

666
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,884
Richa.. they are passing
the Parliament house!

667
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,048
I am right behind them.

668
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:12,825
I have an idea! Look..
there might be..

669
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:16,192
..a car phone in the car
which you are driving.

670
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:17,321
Just check it.

671
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:18,956
Without disconnecting this call..

672
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,262
..you can talk to the police
using that phone.

673
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:25,899
Hurry up!
- Car phone! Car phone!

674
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:27,031
Radio! Radio!

675
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:31,000
Wow! Pretty girl!
- What?

676
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:32,336
Sorry! Sorry!

677
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:34,572
I couldn't find a car phone!

678
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:41,281
O Sandy.. you just follow Bobby!

679
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:03,204
Oh no! Richa, you are not
going to believe this!

680
00:47:03,544 --> 00:47:05,011
But my phone's battery is going off!

681
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,038
Do something, Sandy!

682
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:09,240
If this call got disconnected then
I won't be able to dial again!

683
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,942
So you tell me what to do, Richa!

684
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:13,216
I can either stop the car
and charge the phone!

685
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:15,312
Or I can follow them!
What do you want?

686
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,957
You follow Bobby!

687
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:21,994
Damn it!
- What happened?

688
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:24,121
Richa, there is no petrol
in the car! - What!

689
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:27,263
Do something, Sandy! Do something!

690
00:47:28,002 --> 00:47:29,993
Relax!
- Hello, Sandy! - I'll try my best.

691
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:31,963
Okay! Just hang in there!

692
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:57,324
Hello! Hello!

693
00:47:58,433 --> 00:47:59,457
Hello!

694
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:06,597
Hello!
- Hello!

695
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,066
Hello! What's happening?
- Just hang on!

696
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:36,468
Richa, I have lost them!
I have lost them!

697
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:44,435
Richa!

698
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:12,363
Morning, sir!

699
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:13,531
Morning! Morning!

700
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,074
I got your leave application
this morning!

701
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:20,171
I am pleased to inform you!
- Thank you, sir!

702
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:21,305
That your leave is cancelled.

703
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,613
What! Sir, you can't do this!

704
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,384
I can do anything I want!
- But sir..

705
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:31,548
Well unfortunately you chose the
wrong day to ask for the leave.

706
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:33,489
Because today is the day
we need you the most.

707
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:36,259
The Indian Prime Minister
is coming to London.

708
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,031
And the Indian delegation
requested that..

709
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:42,159
..an Indian officer takes
charge of the security.

710
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:43,565
They have even recommended
your name.

711
00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:47,398
But sir, I..
- No ifs and buts..

712
00:49:47,575 --> 00:49:49,099
Orders are orders!

713
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,141
Yeah! Yeah!

714
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:36,685
Good morning, ma'am! It's a
pleasure to meet the Prime Minister.

715
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,622
We are happy to receive you.
- Thank you.

716
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:53,172
So you are an Indian?
- Yes, sir.

717
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,099
Why.. why do the authorities
here think that..

718
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:57,234
..that we don't know
how to speak English?

719
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,369
That's not true, sir!

720
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:00,741
Then why have they appointed
you for madam's security?

721
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:03,240
So that you people feel
more comfortable.

722
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,113
By the way English officers can..

723
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:07,346
..kill anybody to save madam's life.

724
00:51:07,722 --> 00:51:10,555
But an Indian officer can even lay
down his life if the need arises.

725
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,249
What's your name?

726
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,754
Rohan, ma'am! Rohan Nath!

727
00:51:17,698 --> 00:51:19,791
Here! We have reached Knight Bridge!

728
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:22,663
Here! For him and me!
- Thank you!

729
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,203
Thank you!
- Listen! Mister!

730
00:51:24,405 --> 00:51:25,497
What happened?

731
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,265
I hope that your wife..
- Fine!

732
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:31,771
Go to the cash counter.

733
00:51:32,313 --> 00:51:35,214
And withdraw 50,000 pounds
from your account.

734
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:37,314
What! 50,000 pounds!

735
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,221
I think you have not done
complete research on me!

736
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:42,547
I don't have that kind of money!

737
00:51:43,257 --> 00:51:46,852
Go to the counter, Sid! And
inquire about the balance.

738
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,330
Yeah! You want to hear
about it? Hang on!

739
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:54,233
Excuse me. Hi. My name
is Siddharth Verma.

740
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:55,359
I would like to know
my balance please.

741
00:51:55,536 --> 00:51:56,798
What is your account number?

742
00:51:56,904 --> 00:52:01,238
0191.. 0000.. 52!

743
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:04,574
Mr. Siddharth Verma!
- Yes!

744
00:52:04,912 --> 00:52:07,710
Your account is 1.5 million pounds.

745
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:08,839
What!

746
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,180
And your request to withdraw
50000 pounds..

747
00:52:11,285 --> 00:52:13,310
..has already been processed.

748
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:15,779
Just take this.

749
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,283
And sign here.

750
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:24,753
What are you thinking, Sid?
Sign and take the money.

751
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:26,657
What the hell is going on?

752
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:27,791
How come there is so much
money in my account?

753
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:30,870
The one whom we are happy with..
we make him happy.

754
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:34,569
Now quickly take the money
and reach Windsor Castle!

755
00:52:34,942 --> 00:52:36,637
There is a phone booth
near the castle.

756
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:38,539
You have to leave the money there.

757
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:41,274
So you can download ring tone..

758
00:52:41,382 --> 00:52:43,714
..from the internet or with
a Bluetooth you can..

759
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:44,875
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

760
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:47,614
I need a car charger for this
phone! It's really urgent!

761
00:52:47,722 --> 00:52:48,746
There is a queue!

762
00:52:48,856 --> 00:52:50,585
I have to..
- This is really..

763
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,285
I'm sorry..
- My battery is dying, mister!

764
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:56,625
I said I am sorry! Go to the
end of the line! Please!

765
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:26,850
I need a car charger!

766
00:53:31,365 --> 00:53:33,356
Take it easy, man! Take it easy!

767
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,428
I need a car charger!

768
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:42,733
How much?

769
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,409
It's okay! It's on the house!

770
00:53:44,745 --> 00:53:46,440
How.. much?

771
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:48,410
6.. 50!

772
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:52,409
I will give you the change.

773
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:54,384
Keep.. the change.

774
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:56,413
Thanks!

775
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,488
Keep the gun too!

776
00:54:08,702 --> 00:54:10,727
Mama, please don't stand
near the window.

777
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:11,862
It can be dangerous, mama!

778
00:54:11,972 --> 00:54:14,372
Don't worry! It's bullet proof.

779
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,674
Besides this, ma'am can
look out of the window.

780
00:54:16,777 --> 00:54:18,404
But nobody can see
ma'am from outside.

781
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:20,810
You have organised a tight
security for me.

782
00:54:21,415 --> 00:54:22,541
We have to do it, ma'am.

783
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:26,477
It's our duty and you
are our guest too.

784
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:32,791
Guest? You live in England.
But your culture is Indian.

785
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,859
Leave me! Leave me!
Take me to my mama!

786
00:54:37,698 --> 00:54:38,722
Leave me!

787
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:46,397
I am not your uncle or mummy
or daddy's friend.

788
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,804
I am a bad man. Really bad.

789
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:54,343
If you screamed again..
then I will behead you..

790
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:58,475
..and hang your head
in front of the car.

791
00:54:58,953 --> 00:54:59,977
Okay.

792
00:55:20,508 --> 00:55:22,533
Excuse me! Follow the car!
- Which car?

793
00:55:22,643 --> 00:55:23,667
That car!
- Okay!

794
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:37,017
Hello! Pick up the phone, Richa!

795
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:42,621
Hello! Hello! Hello, Richa! Hello!

796
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:47,464
Hello, Richa! Richa!

797
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:51,037
Hello! Richa! Pick up the phone!

798
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:52,699
Hello!
- Hello!

799
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:56,465
Richa! Good news! I got
the phone charger!

800
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:59,778
But there is one problem.
There is no car.

801
00:56:01,048 --> 00:56:05,542
Just find a car and charge the
phone, Sandy. Hurry up. Please!

802
00:56:08,856 --> 00:56:09,880
Found it!

803
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:14,486
Excuse me. Look, I have a very
tragic, tragic problem.

804
00:56:14,595 --> 00:56:15,619
And I need your help.

805
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:16,787
What?

806
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:18,762
Until yesterday I had only
one problem. No girlfriend.

807
00:56:18,899 --> 00:56:20,560
Now girlfriend. But
miscommunication.

808
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:21,895
Then communication.
But cross connection!

809
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,026
That woman, no husband, no child!

810
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:25,698
Then child, but girlfriend!

811
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:27,500
Then no girlfriend, no child!

812
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,769
Then car, but no petrol.
Then no car, but phone.

813
00:56:30,978 --> 00:56:35,813
Now phone, but no batteries.
Then charger, but no car.

814
00:56:36,016 --> 00:56:38,610
Now phone and charger but still no..

815
00:56:40,054 --> 00:56:41,078
You get it?

816
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:43,580
No?

817
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,715
No?

818
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:46,520
Can you just move to the
side a second? Yes.

819
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:48,890
Hang on! I will explain.

820
00:56:50,564 --> 00:56:54,796
Now car.. phone.. charger.
And woman on the phone.

821
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:57,033
And you outside. Get it?

822
00:56:58,572 --> 00:56:59,596
Okay! Bye!

823
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:05,576
But it's not my car!

824
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:38,935
Hi, Pam.
- Yeah, boss!

825
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:40,873
Pam, they have kidnapped Bobby.

826
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:43,606
O God!

827
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:44,741
They want me to do some big job..

828
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:46,581
..and then they will
put the blame on me.

829
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,913
1.5 million has been transferred
in my account.

830
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:50,783
Do you want me to trace the funds?

831
00:57:51,258 --> 00:57:53,590
No point. Must be from
a numbered account.

832
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:57,224
Boss, please! Please let me
speak to the chief this time!

833
00:57:57,631 --> 00:57:59,690
Without MI5 you can't
do anything, boss!

834
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,525
And what is the guarantee that
after getting their work done..

835
00:58:01,635 --> 00:58:03,899
..they will release Richa and Bobby?

836
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:05,028
They..

837
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:06,697
Nothing will happen to them!
Just give me sometime!

838
00:58:07,174 --> 00:58:09,608
If I can't do anything then I
will myself talk to the chief.

839
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,644
For the moment try to crack
the code as soon as possible.

840
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:13,906
Okay.
- Just a minute.

841
00:58:14,014 --> 00:58:16,608
As such I am working on the
beginning and end of the code.

842
00:58:16,717 --> 00:58:18,150
But its middle digits.

843
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:19,719
I have understood the meaning.
- What is it?

844
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:24,116
It's 66600. Three times
6 meaning 1800.

845
00:58:24,224 --> 00:58:25,623
1800 hours.

846
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,556
If this code is linked
to those people then..

847
00:58:27,661 --> 00:58:29,822
..they will surely do something
this evening at 6 o'clock.

848
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:33,795
Please, Sameera! Please!
Try to understand!

849
00:58:33,934 --> 00:58:38,030
I am not lying to you! No!
I can't tell you!

850
00:58:39,925 --> 00:58:41,916
It's for security reasons!
I cannot tell you!

851
00:58:43,962 --> 00:58:45,953
Please! Stop, baby! Stop!

852
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,732
It's not a girl. It's a woman.

853
00:58:50,702 --> 00:58:51,999
It is not what you are thinking!

854
00:58:54,773 --> 00:58:57,401
Sam.. Sameera, please! Sameera,
listen to me now!

855
00:58:57,976 --> 00:58:59,170
No! Don't hang up!

856
00:58:59,277 --> 00:59:00,744
Excuse me!
- Yes!

857
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,040
Ma'am is calling you!

858
00:59:05,784 --> 00:59:06,808
I will call you back!

859
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,014
Yes, ma'am!

860
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,383
With whom were you talking?

861
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:17,885
Sorry to have disturbed you, ma'am!

862
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:20,290
With whom were you talking?

863
00:59:23,068 --> 00:59:25,832
Girlfriend! Today is her birthday!

864
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,768
I was explaining to her
that I can't come today.

865
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,198
Call her here!

866
00:59:31,076 --> 00:59:34,273
What?
- I said call her here!

867
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:52,788
Leave me! Leave me!

868
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:55,191
Leave me!

869
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:01,796
Mama!

870
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:10,478
Mama! I want to go home!
I want mama!

871
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:07,195
Sandy!

872
01:01:08,406 --> 01:01:10,101
Sandy, they have come
here with Bobby!

873
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,399
They have brought Bobby here!

874
01:01:12,511 --> 01:01:13,535
Oh my God!

875
01:01:16,414 --> 01:01:20,316
Don't worry, Richa! I won't let
anything happen to you people!

876
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,543
Okay!

877
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:24,815
Rohan, if this is going to
be one of your surprises..

878
01:01:24,923 --> 01:01:26,117
..I am going to be really,
really mad!

879
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,521
I told you that I am going
to be! You don't..

880
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,559
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

881
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:41,430
I can't believe this! Gayatri Devi!

882
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:46,569
I am so sorry!

883
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,472
So you are Sam! Sameera!

884
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,481
No! Yes!

885
01:01:51,883 --> 01:01:54,181
Do you know.. why I
have called you here?

886
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:58,017
To scold me! I know you
are upset! It's my fault!

887
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,858
You wanted to know who is the girl
who calls again and again..

888
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,087
..and troubles the head
of security! No!

889
01:02:04,963 --> 01:02:10,026
I wanted to see.. who is that
girl whom Rohan loves so much!

890
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,941
I don't need you before 6 o'clock!

891
01:02:19,377 --> 01:02:22,608
Before the conference begins..
I am here in my room.

892
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,375
And as it is you have posted
security guards outside.

893
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:28,276
So leave.

894
01:02:29,554 --> 01:02:32,887
But ma'am.. -Rohan! That's an order!

895
01:02:53,511 --> 01:02:55,979
No problem! No problem at all!
No problem whatsoever!

896
01:02:58,283 --> 01:02:59,307
See you!

897
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:05,279
Mister Verma! You can
give that money to me!

898
01:03:13,598 --> 01:03:14,622
Thank you!

899
01:03:17,302 --> 01:03:18,564
Thank you very much!

900
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:25,669
Okay! I have got the money with me!

901
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:30,111
Good! We will meet you at
the dock at exactly 6:30!

902
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:34,413
Okay! - Put the passage on the
liner! And keep everything ready!

903
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,543
Yes, ma'am!

904
01:03:40,158 --> 01:03:42,956
Tell me! What you have
done for us till now..

905
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:45,655
..thanks a lot, Mr. Siddharth Verma!

906
01:03:45,764 --> 01:03:47,459
Thank you very, very much!

907
01:03:47,565 --> 01:03:50,591
And we have not harmed
Richa and Bobby!

908
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:52,229
They haven't been hurt at all!

909
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:53,497
Now what do you want?
What do you want?

910
01:03:53,672 --> 01:03:56,038
Nothing! Now we want nothing!

911
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:58,974
In fact right now Bobby and
Richa are waiting for you..

912
01:03:59,077 --> 01:04:01,705
..at Hilton Hotel's coffee shop.

913
01:04:02,314 --> 01:04:03,975
And till the time you reach there..

914
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:05,549
..our man will look after them.

915
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,674
So don't worry.

916
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:08,109
Go there quickly, Sid!

917
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:12,282
Before we change our mind..
take them from there!

918
01:04:13,692 --> 01:04:14,716
Bye!

919
01:04:48,193 --> 01:04:51,424
"Lovely love songs."

920
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:55,224
"I have started humming."

921
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:59,091
"A slight intoxication."

922
01:04:59,404 --> 01:05:03,204
"Has shrouded over my heart."

923
01:05:03,308 --> 01:05:06,505
"Lovely love songs."

924
01:05:07,145 --> 01:05:10,581
"I have started humming."

925
01:05:10,682 --> 01:05:14,311
"A slight intoxication."

926
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:18,179
"Has shrouded over my heart."

927
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,190
"Loving you, loving
you, loving you."

928
01:05:21,426 --> 01:05:24,293
"O beloved."

929
01:05:25,163 --> 01:05:28,724
"Loving you, loving
you, loving you."

930
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:33,126
"O beloved."

931
01:05:33,238 --> 01:05:36,207
"Loving you, loving
you, loving you."

932
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:40,741
"O beloved."

933
01:05:57,695 --> 01:06:01,153
"Frosty feelings."

934
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:05,163
"Has now started melting."

935
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:12,706
"Life has got a new meaning."

936
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:16,180
"Frosty feelings."

937
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:20,178
"Has now started melting."

938
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:27,391
"Life has got a new meaning."

939
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:34,855
"I have started staggering."

940
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:42,733
"It started giving the whereabouts
of destination."

941
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:44,435
No, Pam. It can't be so simple.

942
01:06:44,742 --> 01:06:46,835
Somebody kidnaps my wife
and children. And..

943
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:53,446
And deposits 1.5 million
pounds in my account.

944
01:06:54,252 --> 01:06:57,153
From that I give 50,000
pounds to their man.

945
01:06:58,256 --> 01:07:00,781
And they are ready to release
Bobby and Richa. I mean..

946
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,884
You are right! There is much
more than what meets the eye.

947
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:06,230
Everything depends on that code.
Did you understand anything?

948
01:07:06,531 --> 01:07:07,896
Sorry, boss. I didn't
understand anything.

949
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:14,570
54007. 007 is James Bonds number.
- You are serious, Pam?

950
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:15,900
I mean.. I don't know.

951
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:18,401
Seriously I just can't
understand, boss.

952
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:20,740
Keep trying! Keep trying! I
will call you later! Okay!

953
01:07:20,845 --> 01:07:21,903
Yes, boss!
- Bye!

954
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:28,643
Richa!

955
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,879
Richa! Richa!

956
01:07:30,822 --> 01:07:33,723
I had no other option than
stealing the car.. ok.

957
01:07:33,825 --> 01:07:35,258
Sandy how could you?

958
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,384
How could you?

959
01:07:36,561 --> 01:07:37,585
What was the need..

960
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:45,666
Princess Daisy.
- What?

961
01:07:46,504 --> 01:07:48,199
I found something like a bracelet..

962
01:07:48,306 --> 01:07:50,934
..and princess Daisy
is written on it.

963
01:07:52,577 --> 01:07:55,808
Oh.. now I understood Richa..

964
01:07:56,314 --> 01:07:58,805
Surely they must have kept
you in a princess's palace.

965
01:07:59,584 --> 01:08:01,950
Sandy..
- I have got an idea.

966
01:08:02,053 --> 01:08:06,615
I have got an idea! A book
shop! Yes a book shop!

967
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:07,884
Where is the damn book shop?

968
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:09,283
What?

969
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:25,633
Oh no.

970
01:08:42,527 --> 01:08:44,324
All set, it's all set bro.

971
01:08:47,632 --> 01:08:48,997
I have set the bird up.

972
01:08:50,935 --> 01:08:53,495
I have clipped her wings too.

973
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:56,463
You can come and cut her throat.

974
01:08:57,642 --> 01:09:01,009
Neither you nor I have to
cut her throat..

975
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:02,908
Siddharth has left.

976
01:09:03,815 --> 01:09:08,514
You were right he can kill
anyone to save his wife.

977
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:10,513
He will reach on time.

978
01:09:11,389 --> 01:09:13,289
Just stay away from
the prime minister..

979
01:09:13,391 --> 01:09:14,517
..when the bullet is fired.

980
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:17,993
Or you might lose your
life along too.

981
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:21,298
And yes, you will receive
the rest of the money..

982
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,299
..once the work is done.

983
01:09:23,668 --> 01:09:26,034
Have fun captain.
- Thank you bro.

984
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:39,807
Who are you?

985
01:09:41,419 --> 01:09:43,649
Sam! Sam! Sam!

986
01:09:43,755 --> 01:09:45,382
You are going to kill
the prime minister?

987
01:09:45,857 --> 01:09:46,881
Why did you come back?

988
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,382
I am not going to let you do that.

989
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,057
Just Leave me!

990
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:10,938
Leave me!

991
01:10:42,413 --> 01:10:44,040
Excuse me.
- Yes, how can I help you?

992
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:46,074
I am looking for a book on royalty.

993
01:10:46,484 --> 01:10:48,679
Are you looking for
something particular?

994
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:51,853
I am looking for a book
on princess Daisy.

995
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,116
Princess Daisy!

996
01:10:53,491 --> 01:10:56,119
How can you call princess
Daisy royalty?

997
01:10:56,227 --> 01:10:57,785
So what do you want me
to call it, a horse?

998
01:10:57,895 --> 01:11:00,125
Princess Daisy was a horse!

999
01:11:00,498 --> 01:11:02,125
She was the finest in England.

1000
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,626
Ruled the ascot.

1001
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:08,065
But sadly, three months ago
she died in a stable fire.

1002
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:14,601
Richa, that bracelet belongs to
a horse and not a princess.

1003
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:16,470
And it..

1004
01:11:20,017 --> 01:11:21,644
Would you know where
that fire took place?

1005
01:11:34,799 --> 01:11:36,164
We have troubled you
a lot, isn't it.

1006
01:11:36,968 --> 01:11:38,435
Now, soon our work
will be complete..

1007
01:11:38,536 --> 01:11:41,164
..and your troubles will end.

1008
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:45,439
You didn't understand. It's
time for you to die, darling.

1009
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:50,508
I don't know what work you
are going to complete.

1010
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:54,645
But please let me and Bobby go.

1011
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,118
We will not tell anyone about you.

1012
01:11:58,556 --> 01:12:00,183
I cannot trust you.

1013
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,190
But Bobby is still a child.

1014
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:03,658
What do you think Monica,
shall we spare him?

1015
01:12:04,162 --> 01:12:07,461
But he has seen you darling.

1016
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:11,961
Let's do one thing, let's
blind him. - No.

1017
01:12:12,136 --> 01:12:15,003
What if he described you to someone?

1018
01:12:16,574 --> 01:12:18,201
Then we will cut off his tongue too.

1019
01:12:18,843 --> 01:12:21,539
Darling, he can make a sketch.

1020
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:24,208
We can spare him after cutting
off his fingers.

1021
01:12:24,315 --> 01:12:27,113
Monica, you are so unreasonable
at times.

1022
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:30,218
It is Mrs. Verma's last wish
we will have to fulfill it.

1023
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:32,880
See you Mrs. Verma.

1024
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:56,239
Everything is over, Sandy.

1025
01:12:56,614 --> 01:12:58,707
Nothing is over Richa,
nothing is over.

1026
01:12:59,183 --> 01:13:00,673
Keep courage for a while.

1027
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:02,750
I know where they have hidden you.

1028
01:13:02,854 --> 01:13:04,185
I will not let anything
happen to you.

1029
01:13:04,288 --> 01:13:05,516
I will not let anything
happen to you, Richa.

1030
01:13:05,623 --> 01:13:09,855
Sandy, I have never met you.

1031
01:13:11,896 --> 01:13:14,262
But I feel as if I have
known you for years.

1032
01:13:16,634 --> 01:13:19,899
You know, at times like these
even your kin don't help you.

1033
01:13:20,638 --> 01:13:26,167
And you are risking your
life for a stranger.

1034
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:32,850
Really Sanjana is very lucky
to have someone like you.

1035
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:43,152
I wish.. I could meet you and thank
you once before dying, Sandy.

1036
01:13:44,829 --> 01:13:48,560
But I think I will have
to do that on the phone.

1037
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:56,299
Thank you for everything
Sandy and good bye.

1038
01:13:57,074 --> 01:13:59,975
Don't disconnect Richa,
don't disconnect.

1039
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:03,941
Sandy, you did everything
that I asked you to.

1040
01:14:04,682 --> 01:14:06,582
You have to agree to
this last thing too.

1041
01:14:06,951 --> 01:14:08,282
Go back Sandy,

1042
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:14,323
Because what I am going to do now,
no one can help me in that.

1043
01:14:17,628 --> 01:14:19,186
Good bye Sandy.
- Richa.

1044
01:14:19,964 --> 01:14:22,330
I know where you are Richa.
I am coming.

1045
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:23,991
You stay there!

1046
01:14:24,201 --> 01:14:25,668
I am coming, okay!

1047
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:29,337
I am.. Damn!

1048
01:15:16,153 --> 01:15:17,643
We have deposited 1.5
million pounds..

1049
01:15:17,755 --> 01:15:20,121
..in Siddharth Verma's account.

1050
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,659
When the investigation
will take place..

1051
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:25,661
..MI5 will know, that this money
has been transferred..

1052
01:15:25,763 --> 01:15:28,391
..from a numbered account.
Untraceable.

1053
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:32,725
He has already made a payment
of 50,000 pound..

1054
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:34,396
..further implicating him.

1055
01:15:35,172 --> 01:15:36,400
All the doubts will be on him.

1056
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:40,675
Exactly at 6:30 out yacht will
be ready at the docks..

1057
01:15:40,778 --> 01:15:42,939
..and we will go away from here.

1058
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:46,215
Relax captain, relax.

1059
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:49,144
And about the wife and child.

1060
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:53,882
Her husband will be forced to shoot
the Indian prime minister.

1061
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,419
And we will kill his
wife and children.

1062
01:15:57,795 --> 01:15:59,126
No one will even suspect you.

1063
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,989
Just stay away from
room number 1426.

1064
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:04,091
Oh my God.

1065
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:45,809
Don't be scared! Don't be scared!
I have come to help you.

1066
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:54,475
Mummy!

1067
01:16:57,054 --> 01:16:58,078
Bobby.

1068
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,492
Excuse me sir. - One second,
I'll call you back. Yes?

1069
01:17:04,862 --> 01:17:06,955
Can you step outside
for a minute please?

1070
01:17:07,865 --> 01:17:09,423
Is there a problem?
- Yes.

1071
01:17:12,436 --> 01:17:13,460
Okay.

1072
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:15,162
One minute.

1073
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,501
What's the problem?

1074
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:23,040
Actually madam.. we don't know.

1075
01:17:23,147 --> 01:17:24,512
You can speak in front of me.

1076
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:28,507
We just have found a dead body
in the hotel. A young lady.

1077
01:17:30,387 --> 01:17:31,911
There might be something wrong.

1078
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,990
We don't want you to leave the room.

1079
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:37,183
We suggest you cancel
your conference.

1080
01:17:37,294 --> 01:17:39,524
Cancel the conference?
I can't do that!

1081
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:42,530
Excuse me mama, he is right.

1082
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:46,233
Your security is much more
important than the conference.

1083
01:17:46,904 --> 01:17:47,928
They have found a dead body.

1084
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:50,432
Until they don't find out
what the matter is..

1085
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:53,541
I mean..I am not letting
you go anywhere. Please.

1086
01:17:54,178 --> 01:17:55,543
If anything happens to you..
- Nothing will happen.

1087
01:17:56,914 --> 01:17:59,542
If madam wants to, the conference
will surely take place.

1088
01:18:01,352 --> 01:18:02,944
I will take madam's responsibility.

1089
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:05,185
I promise you everything
will be okay.

1090
01:18:05,523 --> 01:18:07,548
Are you sure.
- Of course I am.

1091
01:18:28,946 --> 01:18:29,970
Come on quick.

1092
01:18:40,024 --> 01:18:41,048
Come on, get in quick.

1093
01:18:50,901 --> 01:18:51,925
Look.. Catch them!

1094
01:18:57,474 --> 01:18:59,601
Hey.. Stop them!

1095
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:03,003
Hey Stop them!

1096
01:19:41,018 --> 01:19:46,320
"54007, 007 is James Bond's number."

1097
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:49,082
"Sorry boss, but I cannot
understand anything."

1098
01:19:51,028 --> 01:19:52,518
54 Bond Street.

1099
01:20:30,067 --> 01:20:34,697
Oh my God, they want to kill the PM.

1100
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:43,045
Good evening Mr. Siddharth Verma.

1101
01:20:44,415 --> 01:20:46,713
You have understood
what we want to do.

1102
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,520
Now understand what you want to do.

1103
01:22:42,466 --> 01:22:46,095
Richa! Richa!

1104
01:22:50,707 --> 01:22:51,731
Richa.

1105
01:22:52,776 --> 01:22:53,834
Monica.

1106
01:22:57,815 --> 01:22:58,839
Hello.

1107
01:23:27,244 --> 01:23:28,268
Take it easy girl.

1108
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:32,873
Oh fish!

1109
01:23:55,205 --> 01:23:56,229
Hey Monica!

1110
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:06,876
You?
- You?

1111
01:24:07,784 --> 01:24:08,808
Who are you?

1112
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:10,310
Good that you have arrived?

1113
01:24:10,554 --> 01:24:13,546
But what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1114
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,914
Now that you have arrived,
do something Sandy.

1115
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:20,627
Sa..Sandy!
- Yes Sandy, she is Richa.

1116
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:26,894
Richa!
- Sanjana. My Sanjana.

1117
01:24:27,738 --> 01:24:29,933
But how did you come in,
all those goons.

1118
01:24:30,307 --> 01:24:31,604
I have taken care of all the goons.

1119
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:32,936
Now I have to get you out.

1120
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,868
Come on. Just a minute Sandy.

1121
01:24:34,978 --> 01:24:36,206
We don't have much time.

1122
01:24:36,313 --> 01:24:37,575
They are about to kill the PM.

1123
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:38,943
We have to do something quick.

1124
01:24:40,851 --> 01:24:41,909
Oh my God.

1125
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,515
Sanjana, take Bobby.
- Okay.

1126
01:24:46,924 --> 01:24:48,391
Richa, let's go..

1127
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:03,937
Kabir Khan, Indian intelligence.

1128
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:07,238
Ex.. Indian intelligence.

1129
01:25:11,748 --> 01:25:16,913
You.. why do you want to kill
the Indian prime minister?

1130
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:18,311
Did you see Rohan?

1131
01:25:18,922 --> 01:25:21,948
I told you not to underestimate
Siddharth Verma.

1132
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:24,327
He found out about our mission.

1133
01:25:25,629 --> 01:25:28,894
Good! Saves us the trouble.

1134
01:25:35,973 --> 01:25:36,997
Here.

1135
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:44,007
This is the gun you have to use
to shoot the prime minister.

1136
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:49,477
At 6 o'clock if you don't
fire, then I will.

1137
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:54,789
And your wife and child will die.

1138
01:26:00,397 --> 01:26:01,557
Why you are doing this?

1139
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:05,298
Me and my brother, kept rotting
in the Pakistan Jail..

1140
01:26:05,402 --> 01:26:07,870
..for 2 years, we kept
writing letters.

1141
01:26:08,839 --> 01:26:11,831
But the Indian government
refused to recognise us.

1142
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:14,308
My brother died in front
of me, tolerating..

1143
01:26:14,411 --> 01:26:16,811
..the thrashing of the
Pakistanis for 2 years.

1144
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:20,912
For the government, that
left his body unclaimed.

1145
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:25,319
If Gayatri Devi wanted, we
could have been released.

1146
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:27,953
Gayatri Devi was just the
defence minister then.

1147
01:26:29,426 --> 01:26:31,326
And you very well know,
anything can happen..

1148
01:26:31,428 --> 01:26:33,055
..on such secret missions.

1149
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:35,331
I had joined the intelligence
to become a martyr..

1150
01:26:35,432 --> 01:26:37,957
..and not to die a silent death.

1151
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:41,336
If you want to see your
wife and kid alive..

1152
01:26:41,438 --> 01:26:43,531
..I want to see the
prime minister dead.

1153
01:26:50,714 --> 01:26:51,738
Cell phone.

1154
01:27:00,023 --> 01:27:01,684
Room number 1426.

1155
01:27:09,666 --> 01:27:10,690
All the best.

1156
01:27:22,746 --> 01:27:23,906
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1157
01:27:25,482 --> 01:27:28,849
Hi I need your help, I am from MI5.
My name is Siddharth Verma

1158
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:31,614
Yes Mr. Verma, I have
been waiting for you.

1159
01:27:31,722 --> 01:27:33,656
Room number 1426.

1160
01:27:58,648 --> 01:27:59,672
Officer.

1161
01:27:59,783 --> 01:28:00,943
Officer! Officer! We need to see
the prime minister right now!

1162
01:28:01,051 --> 01:28:03,019
Stop! Stop! I have to go in,
her life is in danger.

1163
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,485
I am sorry, but you can't go in.

1164
01:28:04,588 --> 01:28:05,612
It is a matter of life
and death officer.

1165
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:07,814
Please officer.
- Who are you two?

1166
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:09,149
What do you want?

1167
01:28:10,794 --> 01:28:14,491
Officer! Officer.. Rohan,
Rohan Nath.

1168
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,791
We have found the right
person at the right time.

1169
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,562
You can surely help us. Officer,
my name is Richa Verma.

1170
01:28:19,803 --> 01:28:21,930
I am the wife of MI5 agent
Siddharth Verma.

1171
01:28:22,038 --> 01:28:24,632
Someone has conspired to kill
the Indian Prime minister here.

1172
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:27,710
And they are using my
husband wrongly for it.

1173
01:28:27,811 --> 01:28:29,904
Where is your husband right now?
- Room 1426.

1174
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,982
And my husband thinks that
they have kidnapped me.

1175
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:34,880
That's why he is listening to them.

1176
01:28:34,985 --> 01:28:36,043
I have to meet him.

1177
01:28:37,554 --> 01:28:38,578
Come with me.

1178
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:40,013
You stay here.

1179
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:41,181
I..Come.

1180
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:53,902
Well yes, yes. ..These
are troubled times.

1181
01:29:14,524 --> 01:29:16,219
Yes sir, reception good evening.

1182
01:29:16,593 --> 01:29:19,926
Ally, there is a man
in the lobby. Indian.

1183
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:25,563
Tall, grey jacket. He knows
about us. Kill him.

1184
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,940
Sight seeing is particularly
recommended.

1185
01:29:33,877 --> 01:29:34,901
Sorry ma'am.

1186
01:29:35,879 --> 01:29:39,246
Your time was right, but you
came to the wrong person.

1187
01:29:54,231 --> 01:29:55,892
Relax captain, relax.

1188
01:29:58,068 --> 01:29:59,592
What's wrong with that man, blind?

1189
01:31:00,297 --> 01:31:03,960
If you need something, don't call
room service, just tell me.

1190
01:31:47,744 --> 01:31:49,769
Everything set.
- Good.

1191
01:31:50,747 --> 01:31:52,374
You will receive the rest of
your money at the airport.

1192
01:31:52,949 --> 01:31:53,973
Thanks a lot.

1193
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:55,375
Can I ask you something Raj?

1194
01:31:56,753 --> 01:31:58,277
The post would have been
yours sooner or later.

1195
01:31:58,755 --> 01:31:59,915
Then why this bloodshed?

1196
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:02,355
She is going to lose
the next election.

1197
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,288
But now her sacrifice
won't go waste.

1198
01:32:08,765 --> 01:32:09,789
Just imagine.

1199
01:32:12,035 --> 01:32:15,732
An Indian prime minister is
murdered in a foreign land.

1200
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:20,373
And that too, a woman.

1201
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:24,838
There will be tears
in everyone's eyes.

1202
01:32:25,782 --> 01:32:27,750
And those tears will
soon turn into votes.

1203
01:32:28,785 --> 01:32:30,412
Anyway, I am going to become
the prime minister.

1204
01:32:31,054 --> 01:32:34,751
But the important thing is that, the
party will not lose the elections.

1205
01:32:34,858 --> 01:32:35,882
And as you know.

1206
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,760
A party is much greater
then an individual.

1207
01:32:42,232 --> 01:32:43,256
Politics!

1208
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:45,993
I hate politics you know!

1209
01:32:47,237 --> 01:32:49,432
I just bloody hate politics!

1210
01:32:56,212 --> 01:32:58,874
Ally.
- Sir, there is a problem sir.

1211
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:28,805
Now are you ensured that
we have your wife?

1212
01:33:29,846 --> 01:33:32,110
Now you get ready for
what you have to do.

1213
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:44,383
Kill him.

1214
01:34:02,879 --> 01:34:03,971
I am sorry.

1215
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,513
I hid my identity from you.

1216
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:08,049
I put Bobby and you in this problem.

1217
01:34:58,168 --> 01:35:00,830
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the honourable..

1218
01:35:00,937 --> 01:35:04,566
..prime minister of India.
Mrs. Gayatri Sinha.

1219
01:35:10,947 --> 01:35:13,177
Thank you, thank you very much.

1220
01:35:14,517 --> 01:35:17,850
Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed
an honour, opportunity..

1221
01:35:17,954 --> 01:35:21,481
..and privilege.

1222
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:36,403
We have fought a lot
of evils together.

1223
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,939
The greatest evil that plagues
our society today is terrorism.

1224
01:35:42,245 --> 01:35:46,341
It is the war of cowards that
they want to fight with us.

1225
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:47,882
They want us to go on our knees..

1226
01:35:47,984 --> 01:35:50,009
..and give in to all their demands.

1227
01:35:50,253 --> 01:35:52,619
But we shall take the
fight to its end.

1228
01:36:00,196 --> 01:36:02,892
I believe, that history is nothing..

1229
01:36:02,999 --> 01:36:05,194
..but the road that we leave behind.

1230
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:10,632
Our routes to our future and our
countries are both united.

1231
01:36:11,274 --> 01:36:13,970
In our future and in our past.

1232
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:28,922
Maximum damage, with minimum means..

1233
01:36:29,025 --> 01:36:30,993
..is their mantra.

1234
01:36:46,209 --> 01:36:48,939
We shall not quietly
go into the dark.

1235
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:51,947
For all of us, who choose
to bow down..

1236
01:36:52,048 --> 01:36:55,677
..stop, don't allow them that!

1237
01:37:02,558 --> 01:37:05,652
The enemy hides and
the enemy cheats.

1238
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:07,689
But we shall not..

1239
01:37:12,468 --> 01:37:15,562
What are the chances, you may ask.

1240
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:19,365
Stop.

1241
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:25,645
Move.

1242
01:37:29,352 --> 01:37:30,478
Hey, police!

1243
01:37:49,639 --> 01:37:56,135
Come on get up! Get up! Move! Move!.

1244
01:38:08,624 --> 01:38:11,320
open the damn door. Come
on mama, come on.

1245
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:12,758
Seal the damn place! Seal it!

1246
01:38:13,696 --> 01:38:15,323
I hope you are okay mama,
I hope you are okay.

1247
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:17,462
Yeah, I am okay.
- I am so glad.

1248
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:19,100
You know I can't believe this?

1249
01:38:19,402 --> 01:38:21,370
How can a head of state
be attacked like this?

1250
01:38:21,471 --> 01:38:22,563
Openly!

1251
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:24,638
I am going to shoot everybody.

1252
01:38:25,141 --> 01:38:26,438
Thank God mama, nothing
happened to you.

1253
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:29,544
I don't believe it mama, why would
an Indian shoot you here?

1254
01:38:31,581 --> 01:38:32,605
Unbelievable!

1255
01:38:35,418 --> 01:38:40,185
Raj, how did you know that
the shooter was an Indian?

1256
01:38:46,763 --> 01:38:47,787
Arrest him!

1257
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:17,420
Relax captain, relax.

1258
01:40:19,188 --> 01:40:20,212
Sid!

1259
01:40:20,323 --> 01:40:22,883
Stop it Sid! Stop it!

1260
01:40:30,833 --> 01:40:31,857
Sid!

1261
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:46,365
Excuse me sir.

1262
01:41:46,842 --> 01:41:48,434
The PM is calling you inside.

1263
01:41:56,886 --> 01:42:00,447
Mr. Sandeep Arora.
- Yes ma'am.

1264
01:42:00,556 --> 01:42:01,750
Please come in.

1265
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:12,266
If I could, I would have
called you to Delhi..

1266
01:42:12,368 --> 01:42:15,599
..and given you the Paramveer
medal in front of everyone.

1267
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:23,602
But my advisers tell me, it is best
that your names are not revealed.

1268
01:42:23,813 --> 01:42:25,906
No problem ma'am, I completely
understand.

1269
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,578
You must be very proud of him.

1270
01:42:28,884 --> 01:42:32,285
There are very few people,
that risk their own life..

1271
01:42:32,388 --> 01:42:36,017
..to save others lives.
- Yes ma'am, I am very proud of you.

1272
01:42:40,396 --> 01:42:42,023
This is a personal
thank you from me.

1273
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:45,930
If you need anything,
do let me know.

1274
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,627
Thank you very much ma'am.

1275
01:42:47,737 --> 01:42:48,761
Thank you once again.

1276
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:52,034
Did you see honey bun,
I am a brave man.

1277
01:42:52,675 --> 01:42:54,040
See, you are marrying a brave man.

1278
01:42:55,478 --> 01:42:56,672
So where do you want to
go for the honeymoon?

1279
01:42:58,347 --> 01:42:59,371

Okay.

1289
01:43:24,707 --> 01:43:25,731
