I've always known I was a girl.

544
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,478
I met a trans sister on Facebook from Mumbai.

545
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,013
She helped me discover my true self.

546
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,051
Four years ago, my parents went to India

547
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,285
to visit the temples.

548
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,054
That's when I ran after it.

549
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,091
I survived doing sex work on the streets.

550
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:07,196
It was also there I discovered my passion for dance.

551
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,565
I want to become a true classical dancer.

552
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,237
Then I ran in some problems with the local politician's son

553
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,206
and uh, couldn't stay there very long,

554
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,110
so contacted my parents to come back.

555
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,046
Uh, it didn't take very long for them to find out.

556
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,185
So I ended up back on the streets, surviving,

557
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,119
doing the only work I know.

558
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,090
Then I was beaten and left to die.

559
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,260
I'm scared, I was very scared.

560
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,763
And then I met you.

561
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,134
But don't worry, I'm over you now.

562
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,570
All I wanna do now is get that surgery done,

563
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:50,339
go to Thailand, and become a real woman.

564
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,811
And in six months' time, I'll have enough money to go.

565
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,718

566
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,227

What brings you here?

568
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,748
Can I have whiskey?

570
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,540
ANTHONY: Don't wait six months.

571
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,415
I can't take your money.

572
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:53,629
(Grunting)

573
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,306
- Can I ask you something? - Hmm, go ahead.

574
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,943
Why do you have these scars on your body?

575
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,295
Who is that?

576
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:28,831
Mata.

577
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,332
ANTHONY: Which Mata?

578
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,702
She was a princess who cut off her husband's penis,

579
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,504
because he decided to go to the jungle

580
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,439
to behave like a woman

581
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,941
instead of coming back home on to her bed.

582
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:43,679
After that she became the goddess for transgenders.

583
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,781
Really?

584
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:47,983
Yes.

585
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,858
You know, in the olden days in India,

586
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,261
after 40 days of special praying and fasting for Mata,

587
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:04,300
dai ma, the holy woman, cuts the penis off with a blade.

588
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:07,436
There's a special ritual called

589
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,571
You know, only 50% of people

590
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,306
who go through a nirvana survive.

591
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,779
Well, for some of us becoming a woman is far worthier

592
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:17,913
than our lives.

593
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,485
Sometimes, I see dai ma.

594
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,687
What do you mean?

595
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,690

Wait!

610

Take it back.

611
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,735
- No, that's for you. - Take it back.
