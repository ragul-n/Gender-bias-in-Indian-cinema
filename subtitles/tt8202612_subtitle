1
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,660
When you light a matchstick...

2
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,490
...the flames blaze
up almost arrogantly.

3
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,820
Like it can turn the
entire world down to ashes.

4
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,410
But eventually,
it realizes its worth.

5
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,490
Starts flickering because
its scared of burning out itself.

6
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,410
Finally,
it burns brightly one last time.

7
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,070
And then turns to ashes.

8
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,910
Commissioner sir, this investigation
has been put on top priority.

9
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,780
We're questioning all our informants.

10
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,610
And they have activated their
entire network in the city.

11
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Strict orders have been given, to prevent
this news from being leaked to the media.

12
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,280
Every criminal thinks twice
before killing a Police officer.

13
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Not only did he kill him,
but also burned him alive.

14
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
And left his ashes outside
the Police Station to challenge us.

15
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,360
Whoever he is, he's not afraid of us.

16
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
And that's his biggest strength.

17
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,490
It's so nice to see
all these people here...

18
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,660
...at this early hour
to join this Cleanliness Drive.

19
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,450
In fact, I take responsibility to clean the
entire country, and not this beach alone.

20
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,660
So that our tricolor flag
can proudly soar in the skies.

21
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,820
Wow...

22
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,320
Before making our
tricolor flag proud...

23
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,820
...you should learn
to hoist it properly.

24
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,610
Why raise a commotion
for such a small mistake, dear.

25
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,820
Small mistake!

26
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,320
It could be a small mistake for you.

27
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,660
But not for those soldiers...

28
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,530
...who risk their
lives every day for it.

29
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,530
Nor for those citizens
who stand up in cinema halls...

30
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,950
...and sing the National
Anthem with honor.

31
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,860
But if it's still
a small thing for you...

32
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:36,030
...then every soldier, every citizen
in this country, should be allowed...

33
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,700
...to hang you upside down too.

34
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,110
You should be more careful.

35
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,610
See, you've cut yourself.

36
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,910
Doesn't matter.

37
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
One needs to shed a little
blood to clean up this city.

38
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,030
One can clean up the
city without shedding blood.

39
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,360
Hi. Shikha.

40
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,320
I read that.

41
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,820
Veer.

42
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,570
Shikha.

43
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,450
I'll see you, bye.

44
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,740
I was going.

45
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,610
Yes, Inspector Kadri Speaking.

46
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,700
Yes.

47
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,450
I already got the instructions.

48
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,660
Imagine that your son was never here.

49
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,990
You just send him straight to the
airport, and from there to America.

50
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,990
No need to thank me.

51
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,240
Just transfer the money
in my account by tomorrow.

52
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,280
Sir...

53
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,450
Sir...

54
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,030
But this isn't justice, sir.
This is not justice.

55
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,450
Where are you from?
- Faridabad.

56
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,360
Then you should've stayed there.

57
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,610
Why did you come here with your wife
to lie on the pavement like trash?

58
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,450
All trash shares the same fate.

59
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,410
They don't get justice.

60
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,740
They only get cleaned up.

61
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,610
Just like she did.

62
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,990
Let's go.

63
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,530
Unfortunately...

64
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,660
Our currency changed...

65
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,070
...but your intentions did not.

66
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,780
Whether it's Patil or Qadri.

67
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,660
They all belong to one community.

68
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,200
What's the current rate for
people sleeping on the pavements?

69
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,160
Rascal.

70
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,610
I asked for the rate, not your name.

71
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,820
When you're not ashamed to ask...

72
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,200
why are you ashamed to say it?

73
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,240
2 million.

74
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,240
2 million!

75
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,410
What was the rate in
the year you joined duty?

76
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,990
2,00,000!

77
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,530
2,00,000!

78
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,490
Wow...

79
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,610
Good days have definitely arrived.

80
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,570
There are nearly 4500
religions in this world.

81
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,610
And thousands of people
Die for it and kill for it every day.

82
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,570
But people like you
have created a new religion.

83
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,610
Corruption!

84
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,570
Now, I am going to make your
death a very painful experience.

85
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,740
You'll burn in this life...

86
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,530
...but feel the pain
in your next life as well.

87
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
Poor Qadri sir.

88
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,780
His new toaster was delivered today.

89
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,570
But he himself became a
burnt toast.

90
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,110
And you...

91
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,910
You were supposed to
deliver this two days ago.

92
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,740
If only you had
delivered it on time...

93
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,910
then at least he could've
enjoyed few toasts before he died.

94
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,910
Sir!

95
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,570
Any eyewitness.
- No, sir.

96
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,780
Is everyone around here deaf or blind?
- Yes, sir.

97
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,530
I mean, no sir.

98
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,240
If the protectors of the city
can't protect their own officers...

99
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,950
then people will start
losing faith in the Police.

100
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,240
Yes, sir.

101
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,320
When is DCP Shivansh
Rathod's leave ending?

102
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,110
Papa, you've been sitting
here for two hours?

103
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,860
How many fish must have been caught?

104
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,910
But you are just not moving.

105
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,700
Just sitting there and snoring.

106
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,410
The fish I am after
hasn't taken the bait yet.

107
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,280
Why should I announce my arrival
by catching the small fishes?

108
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,570
Let the word spread...

109
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
about an amateur fisherman...

110
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,860
...who can easily be deceived.

111
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,280
He doesn't know how to fish.

112
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,450
Finally, the big fish will come along.

113
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,450
Fearless!

114
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,320
Arrogant!

115
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,320
To taunt the amateur fisherman.

116
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,860
Then I will lure him.

117
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,950
Catch him and cook him.

118
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,030
We'll have fish fry for dinner.

119
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,410
Okay.

120
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,160
Got him. Got him. Got him.

121
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,450
Hello.

122
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,280
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

123
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,240
Sir, two Police officers
have been burnt to death in Mumbai.

124
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
The Police Commissioner wants you to cut
your vacation short and return to Mumbai.

125
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Papa, where are you going?

126
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,990
I am done catching small fishes, dear.

127
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,280
Time to go after the crocodile.

128
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,160
Welcome back, Shivansh.

129
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,490
Jai Hind, sir.

130
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,660
I hope you had a good
time on your vacation?

131
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,410
I did, sir.
But it was smaller than I expected.

132
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,450
I didn't have an option.

133
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,410
I wanted my brightest
officer on this case.

134
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,530
It's my honesty that
will help us crack this case...

135
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,860
...and not my intelligence.

136
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,320
Well, both the officers who died...

137
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,700
...were facing some kind
of corruption charges.

138
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,530
The inquiry against them was dropped.

139
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,780
We can safely say that honesty
was not one of their qualities.

140
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,660
There are only two options
to stop this killer.

141
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,910
One; We must catch the killer.

142
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,610
Two; Our department's officers
will have to stop being corrupt.

143
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,780
Actually,
sir, we have just one option.

144
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,110
We must catch the killer.

145
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,780
Sorry, sir.

146
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,820
Then catch him.
- I will, sir.

147
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,990
Good morning, officers.

148
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,450
Good morning, sir!

149
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,160
After finishing his duty
Inspector Sadashiv...

150
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,360
...left Santacruz Police
Station at 10 pm.

151
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,450
Next day, at 7 am...

152
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,570
...someone left his ashes
outside the Police Station.

153
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,570
At 11 am, his jeep was
found abandoned on the highway.

154
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,950
During this time, the killer abducted
Inspector Patil and burned him alive.

155
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,610
Turning him to ashes.

156
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,820
And now...

157
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,280
...we Police officers
will turn him to ashes.

158
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,740
Right?
- Yes, sir!

159
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,200
Who were Inspector Patil's friends?
What was his routine?

160
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,070
Whom did he meet after work hours?
Did he have a mistress?

161
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,410
Did he like watching movies? Or not?

162
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,200
Which bar did he drink in?

163
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,490
And from which shop
he used to buy betel-leaf?

164
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,360
We will definitely find some clues,
through these questions.

165
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,450
I want the footage of every CCTV
camera, ATM camera, and toll-bridge

166
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,860
Check the footage of the
ATM outside Inspector Qadri's home.

167
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,660
The killer must have left some clue.

168
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,490
Understood.
- Yes, sir.

169
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,990
Don't spare the rascal.

170
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,200
Two Police officers were
brutally murdered in three days.

171
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,240
We've heard that there's an atmosphere
of fear amongst the Police officers.

172
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,160
Only cowards attack from the dark.

173
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,740
I'm standing right in
front of you and the killer.

174
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,360
In broad daylight. Without any cover.

175
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,820
But sir, it's being said that
both the Police officers were corrupt.

176
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,910
There's also a raging
discussion on the Social Media...

177
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,950
...that the killer maybe
doing something right.

178
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,570
What is your opinion?

179
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,820
I am sure you must
have heard the saying.

180
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,530
"The Long arms of the Law."

181
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,530
In fact, it's been used
in films so many times...

182
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,490
...that it's become a joke.

183
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
Actually,
the Law doesn't have long arms.

184
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Some have big arms, some have small.
Some are weak and some are strong.

185
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,700
But the Law doesn't have long arms.

186
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,110
But only the officers of the Law...

187
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,490
...have a right to take
the Law into their hands.

188
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,820
Filing an FIR is next to impossible.

189
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,530
This killer is giving them
a fitting reply in their own language.

190
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,910
DCP Shivansh has
challenged the killer...

191
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,200
...but this doesn't
look like an easy task.

192
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,360
This slogan has been resonating in
Mumbai as well as throughout the country.

193
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,740
"The corrupt will pay,
and corruption will end."

194
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,700
"The corrupt will pay,
and corruption will end."

195
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,610
"The corrupt will pay,
and corruption will end."

196
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,410
And not just the Police.

197
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,780
I think the killer should also target
the corrupt politicians as well.

198
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,530
And the rapists also.

199
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,490
If we ever meet...

200
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,610
...I will teach him a few
tricks with the matchbox.

201
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,280
These people are no different
from those invaders or the British.

202
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,700
The only difference is
that they came from outside.

203
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,030
And these police officers are
plundering our country from inside.

204
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,110
I've tried taking
the path of non-violence.

205
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,110
But the country now needs
a punisher and not a leader.

206
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,530
I beg you...go away.

207
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,660
Why don't you let us live in peace?

208
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,910
I am not going anywhere.
Nor will I leave you.

209
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,610
Look here, don't think that I'll
be intimidated by you or your uniform.

210
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,610
Understand.

211
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,990
Come, dear.

212
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,700
Excuse me.

213
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,860
Bring him here, let me see.

214
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,570
Hey, baby...

215
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,530
Hey...

216
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
It's okay.

217
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,570
We met on the beach the other day.

218
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,320
Veer.

219
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh, yes.

220
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,780
Is this your puppy?

221
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,030
No.

222
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,240
I found him on the street.

223
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,860
He's in pain.

224
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,910
His pain will grow,...

225
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,610
...it won't reduce.

226
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,490
Isn't there any way to save him?

227
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,610
I can save him.

228
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,780
But the death would be better...

229
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,070
...than the life he would live...

230
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,450
Okay.

231
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,410
It looks like you
cannot deal with death.

232
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,950
Only if it's someone innocent.

233
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,280
I can't see an innocent person die.

234
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,530
DCP Shivash Rathod speaking.

235
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,070
DCP Shivansh's wife speaking.

236
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,070
Sorry Sorry, love.

237
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,820
You were pre-occupied with the case

238
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,070
...and answered the phone
without looking. Right?

239
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,490
Promise, it will never happen again.

240
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,240
Don't ever make promises
that you can't keep.

241
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,990
You left your wife and daughter
mid vacation.

242
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,990
What would you guys have done here?

243
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,410
I haven't gone home since I got here.

244
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,820
Just a minute.

245
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,450
Talk to Pari.

246
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,610
Pari...Dad.

247
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,860
Hi, baby.

248
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,660
Papa, where are you?

249
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,200
Dad's getting a surprise gift for you.

250
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,530
And it will be waiting for you
when you get back home.

251
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,280
I want three chocolates, one ice
cream, and no vegetables for one week.

252
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,110
Okay-okay, done.

253
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Hello.

254
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,200
What "done"?

255
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,240
Look, save your authority
for your Police Station.

256
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,660
Not in my home. Okay.

257
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,740
Okay.

258
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,610
Okay, fine.
I am really busy now.

259
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,200
Let's talk in the morning.

260
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,910
Goodnight love.
- Okay, goodnight.

261
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,030
Say Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

262
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,990
Love you.

263
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,320
Yeah, love, what is it now?

264
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,200
Love?

265
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,410
I think you're mistaking
me for someone close?

266
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,200
I am happy that you called.

267
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,240
Do you want to surrender?

268
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,320
I want the Law to
surrender before Justice.

269
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,570
You're not the first criminal
who thinks of himself as a crusader.

270
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,030
You're not the first Police Officer
who thinks he is above everyone.

271
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,280
The taxpayers are already bearing
the brunt of bringing criminals to justice.

272
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,110
And we're running out of
nooses to hang the criminals.

273
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,240
But our bullets still
make an impact.

274
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,070
It doesn't take a 9mm
bullet to take a life...

275
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,740
...it takes a heart full of courage.

276
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,740
You won't escape.

277
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,410
You can stop worrying about me...

278
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,530
...and try to save the
others who are going to die.

279
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,950
Is this a threat?

280
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,700
No...just advice.

281
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,030
I don't want an honest officer
like you, to put your life at stake.

282
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,740
Those who died had no right to live.

283
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,410
But you do.

284
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,030
Thank you very much for
worrying about my safety.

285
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,700
But I chose this uniform,
knowing the risks that come with it.

286
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,860
I won't stop until,
I have stopped you.

287
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,820
Then I'll give you a chance.

288
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,820
I'll kill the next
cop in your own territory.

289
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,240
Try and stop me.

290
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,990
I will stop you...

291
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,280
...and kill you.

292
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,570
Are you listening?

293
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,200
You just try...

294
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,910
You just try, you rascal.

295
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,240
And I will shoot you!

296
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,950
HEY!

297
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,740
Just get on my turf.

298
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,410
Come on.

299
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,990
Sir...

300
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,610
Sir, we tried tracing the call
with the help of the mobile company.

301
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Here are the records.

302
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,110
But the killer bought
the card with fake details,...

303
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
...so we couldn't trace him.

304
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,070
And sir, he used this voice-modulation
app to disguise his voice.

305
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,280
We tried to separate
the voice from the distortion.

306
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,490
But sorry sir, no luck.

307
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,610
Put every Police station
in the city on alert.

308
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,820
He's challenged us,
but if he attacks...

309
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,910
...he won't make it out alive.

310
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,660
Damle, we already had a deal.

311
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,780
How can you demand
more than 5 million now?

312
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,490
That was a different time, bro.

313
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,780
Back in those days,
villains ran the show.

314
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,990
The Law had her hands tied.

315
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,490
But now there's someone...

316
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,450
...who thinks he's the
upholder of Law and Order.

317
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,700
And he's running around
burning Police officers.

318
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,990
You don't know.

319
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,450
Every Police officer in every Police
station is scared out of his wits.

320
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,860
That's why...

321
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,490
I made an excuse and took the day off.

322
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,570
I am Damle, I never leave my share.

323
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,490
5 million before Holi.

324
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,990
Delivered to my home.

325
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
Right?

326
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,610
When is Holi?

327
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,490
When is Holi?

328
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,320
"O sweetheart"

329
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,320
"O sweetheart"

330
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,070
"The craze that have
occupied my heart"

331
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,410
"Is certainly caused by you"

332
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,700
"It's all your gaze's fault"

333
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,320
"O sweetheart"

334
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,410
"Come closer, why are you far?"

335
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,610
"In this madness of love"

336
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,950
"My heart is intoxicated
in your charms"

337
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,570
"O sweetheart"

338
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,570
"Now I have no sense nor
any idea of things around me"

339
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,910
"What kind of effect is this?"

340
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,160
"I have no sense nor
any idea of things around me"

341
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,410
"What kind of effect is this?"

342
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,320
"It started happening since I met you"

343
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,110
"It started happening since I met you"

344
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,990
"O sweetheart"

345
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,360
"O sweetheart"

346
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,700
"O sweetheart"

347
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,490
"O sweetheart"

348
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,780
"The way you walk,
kills so many peple"

349
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,160
"Someone solve this
riddle of her charm"

350
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,360
"You're a chest filled with beauty,
a blooming lotus"

351
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,700
"I will wait patiently cause
the fruit of wait is sweet"

352
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,360
"You are my dream"

353
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,780
"You are the peace of my heart"

354
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,570
"Please pay attention to me o my love"

355
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,780
"Just pay attention to me once"

356
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,240
"My inner peace is gone"

357
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,490
"Something has happened to my heart"

358
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,820
"My inner peace is gone"

359
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,070
"Something has happened to my heart"

360
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,780
"It started happening since I met you"

361
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,360
"It started happening since I met you"

362
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,950
Did it have to run out of fuel now?

363
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,860
Come, sweetheart.

364
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,320
Sweetheart! Sweetheart!

365
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,280
Fill the tank up!

366
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,240
Sir...

367
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,610
...smoking at the petrol
pump can be dangerous.

368
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,490
Hey wise guy...

369
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,030
...it's also dangerous
to taunt a police officer.

370
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,820
It's not an taunt...

371
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,200
It's a warning.

372
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,320
Rascal, how dare you hit me?

373
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,910
Why are you hitting me?

374
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,030
What did I do?

375
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,280
You bloody...

376
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,410
Come.

377
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,780
Unfortunately, you won't be
able to read tomorrow's headlines.

378
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,660
So let me tell you today.

379
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,660
Petrol Prices and Damle...

380
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,700
...both go up (in flames).

381
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,660
Like I said...

382
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,820
Smoking at the petrol
pump can be dangerous.

383
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
No!

384
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,450
No!

385
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,200
No!

386
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,740
The saying is pretty obvious, sir...

387
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,200
What is ordained, cannot be changed.

388
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,700
You die when its your time to die

389
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,990
Shivansh.

390
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,410
We shouldn't have
fallen for his challenge.

391
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,320
He lied to distract us.

392
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,200
No, sir.

393
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,780
He did just like he said.

394
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,530
He said "our territory."

395
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,030
It was my fault.

396
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,030
I thought he meant the Police Station.

397
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,950
Sir.

398
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,610
Sir.

399
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,030
Sir, where was the first killing?

400
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,660
Santacruz? Why?

401
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,280
And the second?

402
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,160
How does it matter?

403
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,450
Just tell me.

404
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,660
Andheri.

405
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,700
And the third one in Thane.

406
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,200
Meaning the killer is
trying to spell out something...

407
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,950
...using the first letter of the places
where he's committing the murder.

408
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,860
Like 'S' from Santacruz.

409
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,160
'A' from Andheri.

410
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,570
'T' from Thane.

411
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,530
What's the complete word?

412
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,990
SATYAMEV JAYATE!

413
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,660
Truth Alone Triumphs!

414
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,280
Whoever the killer is he's
not some ordinary criminal.

415
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,530
In fact, he's much more dangerous.

416
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,200
Because he thinks that
he's doing the right thing.

417
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,780
He's no different
from the others.

418
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,160
But in his own mind,...

419
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,950
...he's a soldier...

420
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,360
...who wants to fight for the truth
and wants to triumph over lies.

421
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,740
Which means the next target....

422
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,950
...will be someone in
a place that starts with 'Y'.

423
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,660
Absolutely right, sir.

424
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,450
Shinde, I want a report of all the
officers in areas starting with 'Y'...

425
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,910
...especially those have
corruption charges against them.

426
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,530
Okay, sir.

427
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,240
So we can find
out his next target.

428
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,700
Whoever he is, believe me...

429
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,160
he's currently choosing
his next target.

430
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,070
You're back? with another stray puppy.

431
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,070
It's a fracture, but he'll be fine.

432
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,410
Are you fine?

433
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,910
What are these scratches?

434
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,530
It's nothing.

435
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,820
Looks like some animal clawed you.

436
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,660
Did you fall in a tigers cage?

437
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,780
It was more of a cat.

438
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,280
Let me see.

439
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,660
Shikha.

440
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,360
I know I'm a veterinarian.

441
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,820
But I can treat humans too.

442
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,610
"Since I've fallen in love with you"

443
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:13,820
"My soul keeps chanting your name"

444
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,660
"I just pray to God that"

445
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,570
"May you hold the
destiny lines in my hand"

446
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,030
"The words are silent,
so how should I express my heart"

447
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:39,660
"You say the things
that I'm unable to say"

448
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:46,320
"I want to flow
alongside you like water"

449
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,450
"I'll tell the stories
and you keep listening to them"

450
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:59,110
"I want to fly alongside
you like the clouds"

451
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,530
"I'll turn towards you
with just one signal of yours"

452
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:37,780
"The earth and the
sky were both incomplete"

453
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,240
"The destinations and
the paths were both incomplete"

454
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,910
"Everything became
complete when you arrived"

455
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,570
"The world seems
worthless without you"

456
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:03,070
"I'll become your heart
and I'll beat with you"

457
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,700
"I won't let myself
be distant from you"

458
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:15,570
"I want to flow
alongside you like water"

459
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,490
"I'll tell the stories
and you keep listening to them"

460
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:28,360
"I want to fly alongside
you like the clouds"

461
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:34,160
"I'll turn towards you
with just one signal of yours"

462
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,450
Good evening, sir.

463
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,240
Inspector Satish Bhonsle.

464
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,990
Yari Road Police Station.

465
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,320
He will be the killer's next target.

466
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,570
There are other Police officers from
other places facing corruption charges.

467
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,660
But theirs are relatively
less than Bhonsle's.

468
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,360
But maybe the killer might not choose
the obvious target in order to mislead us.

469
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,660
You're forgetting that right
now we're a step ahead of the killer.

470
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,450
He doesn't know that we know...

471
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,990
...that according to 'SATYAMEV JAYATE'
his next target will be 'Y'.

472
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,110
But we have this
advantage only this time.

473
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,740
If we miss this time

474
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,950
...then we'll lose
the element of surprise.

475
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,160
And he'll know that
we've understood his game.

476
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,740
Have you told Inspector
Bhonsle that he's the next target?

477
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,360
No.
- But why?

478
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,530
When you hunt a tiger,
the goat is used as bait.

479
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,910
And the hunter hides
in wait with his gun.

480
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,860
If the goat finds
out that she's bait...

481
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,110
...then she will look at the
hunter and beg him to spare her life.

482
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,570
And the tiger will know
of the hunter's presence.

483
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,320
But you're only
risking Bhonsle's life.

484
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,700
Believe me, sir.
The bait will be unharmed.

485
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,110
But when the tiger comes along...

486
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,450
...we'll hunt him down.

487
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,570
Sir.

488
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,360
This looks more like an
old ghost town Police station.

489
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,950
Both the AC and CC are not working.

490
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,280
In fact, nothing works properly here.

491
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,700
But you're still breathing, Shinde.

492
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,030
Yes, sir.
- Breathe in. Breathe out.

493
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,910
Yes, sir.

494
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,610
Sir, please let me go.

495
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,740
I haven't done anything, sir.
- Aslam.

496
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,240
Right now I want two things.

497
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,700
First is your confession.

498
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,030
And second, my promotion.

499
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,660
But the problem is...

500
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,570
...I can't get one without
the other, Aslam.

501
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,360
I can't.

502
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,240
I know you are innocent. I know.

503
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,070
But Aslam, if all the
criminals are apprehended...

504
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,570
...then no one will
need the Police anymore.

505
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,450
See.

506
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,610
See...

507
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,910
These are gold teeth.

508
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,700
And I didn't get these
by being an honest cop.

509
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,160
Right now I have only two.

510
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,110
I want 32 gold teeth, Aslam.

511
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:10,660
Aslam.

512
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,240
Alcohol is a sin in your religion,
isn't it?

513
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,360
It's a sin, isn't it?

514
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,740
Drink!

515
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,450
Drink it, Aslam. Drink.

516
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,530
Drink.

517
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,660
Drink!

518
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,700
Let me go.

519
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,740
Sir...

520
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,200
I want this bait to be sacrificed.

521
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,530
I will celebrate

522
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:47,990
In fact, I'll throw a feast.

523
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,240
Sir, maybe the killer
isn't doing anything wrong.

524
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,990
Because such Police officers give
a bad name to the entire Department.

525
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,610
You mean to say a handful
of Police officers...

526
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,910
...save the Department
from getting a bad reputation.

527
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,610
What, sir?

528
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,660
It's not one dirty
fish polluting the pond.

529
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,110
In fact a handful of fishes
are trying to save the polluted pond.

530
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,740
Gaikwad, get some tea.

531
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,070
Okay sir.

532
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,780
Sir. Sir.

533
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,030
Please let my Aslam go, sir.

534
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,990
You've kept him in remand for 40 days,
without a reason.

535
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,450
Mother India...he's in remand
because he's in demand.

536
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,860
You know, in your weddings...

537
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,280
... it doesn't take long
for you to say "I do".

538
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,240
But even after I tortured
Aslam in every way I can...

539
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,820
...he didn't accept his fault.

540
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,450
He's innocent, sir.
He hasn't done anything.

541
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,200
My son is very decent.
- Hey...

542
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,740
'Decency' sounds good
only in the Koran (Holy Book)!

543
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,820
Run away.

544
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,660
Gaikwad, get my tea.

545
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:15,660
The Koran you talk
about is the words of God.

546
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,160
You should be scared of God.
Be scared of his judgment.

547
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,610
Be scared of God.

548
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,740
Be scared of his judgment.

549
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,860
It takes you 20 minutes
to say the numaaz right?

550
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,360
Sit here.

551
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,110
Raise your hand and pray.

552
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,660
And I'll raise my
hand to beat your son.

553
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,200
No, sir.

554
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
He'll get a taste of
my hand and my bullet.

555
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,160
No, sir.

556
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,660
Let's see if your God
can stop me in 20 minutes?

557
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,950
Let's see if He sends one
of his angel's to your aid?

558
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,530
No, sir...

559
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,240
No one's coming.

560
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,610
When God is kind...

561
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,450
...even the wicked prosper.

562
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,570
Why you bloody...
- No, sir...

563
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,070
I wore this uniform
to be a protector.

564
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,160
But duty has tied my hands.

565
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,950
I want to put a bullet in him myself.

566
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,240
My son hasn't done anything.

567
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,990
Let my son go.

568
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,490
Let my son go.

569
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,860
Did you hear?

570
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,030
Your mother's time starts now.

571
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,450
You bloody...

572
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,700
I can't hear a thing.

573
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,160
Yes, sir.

574
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,780
No screaming or yelling.

575
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,450
Or beating sound.

576
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:26,200
Can you hear anything?

577
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,740
Is something wrong?

578
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,450
No, sir. Please.

579
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,280
Keep screaming.

580
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,070
Is this working?
- Yes, sir. It's working.

581
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,860
Is it fine?
- It's absolutely fine, sir.

582
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,360
No...
- Sound. It's proper.

583
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,200
I can hear a different sound.

584
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,490
No sir, listen carefully, it's him.

585
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,610
Shinde, these are
two different screams.

586
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,860
Come on.

587
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,280
You are lying.

588
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,530
You are lying that
you didn't see his face.

589
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,990
Sir, he blindfolded me, like the Law.

590
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,280
How could I see?

591
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,740
I see...

592
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:22,360
So why were you screaming
when he was thrashing Bhonsle?

593
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,160
I was screaming because
I was scared, sir.

594
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,530
I thought he would kill me next.

595
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,660
Why? Why? Why?

596
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,360
What kind of a guy are you?

597
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,490
You're trying to save a criminal.

598
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,110
Aren't you ashamed?

599
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,410
You mean the criminal
who saved my life.

600
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,410
You heard everything, didn't you.

601
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,160
How Bhonsle was
torturing me.

602
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,610
But did you come to my rescue?

603
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,950
Why don't you explain to him?

604
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,660
Aslam didn't see anything, sir.

605
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,160
And, even if he did...

606
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,860
...he wouldn't tell you anything.

607
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:22,530
How can you say such
a thing being his mother?

608
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,530
I can because I am a mother.

609
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,070
I've no regret about whatever
happened to that Bhonsle.

610
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,200
My God was kind...

611
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,530
...and the devil was struck down.

612
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,950
My duty is against your sentiments.

613
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:54,660
But as a human being...

614
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,450
I know this was justice.

615
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,240
Goodbye. You can go.

616
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,240
Sorry, sir.
But I let the mother-son go.

617
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,570
I would've done the same thing.

618
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:26,410
Could none of the Police
officers describe him?

619
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,860
They did.

620
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,030
According to the description
from two Police officers...

621
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,490
...the Police artist
prepared two sketches.

622
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,740
One was 'Singham' and
the other was 'Dabbang'.

623
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,950
Just like a chameleon changes
colors to disguise himself...

624
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,490
...he just had wear the police
uniform to disguise himself.

625
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,410
Excuse me, sir.

626
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,570
"Truth alone triumphs; not lies."

627
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:06,160
"Through truth,
the divine path is spread out..."

628
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,990
"...by which the sages whose desires
have been completely fulfilled."

629
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,450
"...reach to where is that
supreme treasure of Truth."

630
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:20,200
This mantra from the 'Mundaka Upanishad' was
declared as India's National Motto in 1949.

631
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,070
You seem to know alot
about Sanskrit and History.

632
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,410
No, sir.

633
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,740
Just a fast 4g internet
connection and Google.

634
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:33,070
When it starts to pour in the city,
even 4G connections dwindle.

635
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:36,360
And there's a storm heading your way.

636
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,160
Just wait and watch.

637
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,740
How can I wait?

638
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:45,280
I have 11 more letters
to complete SATYAMEV JAYAYE.

639
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,320
I see...so you're going to give
me 11 more chances to catch you.

640
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,070
This is your last chance to live.

641
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,240
Who are you to give
me an opportunity to live?

642
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,950
Only God can do that.

643
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,660
God.

644
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:03,200
If God is supposed
to look after the world...

645
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,740
...then he should
get pay cut next month.

646
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,280
Don't cross my path again.

647
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,450
HEY!

648
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,030
I am not someone backs off in fear.
I will cross your path again.

649
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,530
Unfortunately...

650
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,280
There are only a handful of loyal and
honest Police officers left in the country.

651
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,990
I won't enjoy hunting you down.

652
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,070
You will have security with you at
all times.

653
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:33,780
Even at home.
- No, sir.

654
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,740
You're like my son, Shivansh.

655
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:39,490
If we want to catch this killer,...

656
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,280
I need you to be alert and rested.

657
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,200
Sir, I...

658
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,070
Shivansh, it's an order.

659
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,410
Go home.

660
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:50,410
Yes, sir.

661
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,160
This is a nice way
to greet your brother.

662
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,240
You haven't changed at all.

663
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,200
Always sneaking up behind me.

664
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,990
What if I had shot you?

665
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,240
You wouldn't shoot me.

666
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,450
Okay, brother.

667
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,070
Next time you can sneak up behind me.

668
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,450
Sorry, I thought...
- Some killer had broken into the house.

669
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,860
I tell you, brother.

670
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,860
Thanks to your game
of cops and robbers...

671
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,740
...you think everyone else is a criminal.
- Fine, stop lecturing me.

672
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,450
How are you?
- Very angry.

673
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,450
It's been days since you
returned from your vacation.

674
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,110
But you neither called nor come home.

675
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,070
Bro...

676
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,280
I am very sorry.
I am busy with a case.

677
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:34,700
You must have heard
about the killer...

678
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,110
...who is killing Police officers.

679
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,450
That's why I had to leave
your sister-in-law and Pari...

680
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,320
...in the middle of
our vacation and come back.

681
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,740
So what happened, brother?
Did you catch him?

682
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:45,570
No...

683
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,780
...but I will.

684
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,490
Of course, brother.

685
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,450
There's no way he can escape you.

686
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,660
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

687
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,780
But your opinion doesn't matter.

688
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,700
You're my brother.

689
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,160
You're biased.

690
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,990
True.

691
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,780
Maybe the killer is too
smart for you to handle as well.

692
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,240
I don't think you
should underestimate him.

693
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,490
I won't.

694
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,160
Great.

695
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,070
Now at least give me a hug.

696
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,570
Come here.

697
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,450
What medal is that?

698
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,780
This is no ordinary medal.

699
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,610
It's a Gallantry Medal.

700
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,320
Our father was awarded this medal.

701
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:32,160
For doing his duty
honestly and fearlessly.

702
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,780
I want one too.

703
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,450
You've to got to earn it.

704
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,860
You've to earn this
uniform and take a vow.

705
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,450
What vow?

706
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,110
I... I...

707
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,070
Swear...
- No.

708
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:53,200
In the presence of God, I vow to...

709
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,820
Shivansh. Veer.

710
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,240
Papa, please teach us the vow.

711
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,110
Yes, papa. Please.

712
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,410
In the presence of God, I vow to...

713
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:38,700
In the presence of God, I vow to...

714
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:40,450
... always speak the truth.

715
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,530
... always speak the truth.

716
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,820
Be fearless.

717
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:44,990
Be fearless.

718
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:47,030
Always follow the
path of righteousness.

719
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:49,240
Always follow the
path of righteousness.

720
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:51,410
I will protect the citizens...

721
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,780
I will protect the citizens...

722
01:11:53,860 --> 01:12:01,740
...and the constitution of my
country according to the Law.

723
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,240
Respect the Police Department...

724
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,450
Respect the Police Department...

725
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,990
...and it's officers.

726
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,450
...and it's officers.

727
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,820
And always follow their orders.

728
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,860
And always follow their orders.

729
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:20,110
Papa, when I grow up,
I want to be like you.

730
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,410
Me too.

731
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:26,860
The day you two will wear the police
uniform and take the oath together...

732
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,450
...that day I will
proudly salute you both.

733
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,990
But...don't ever
forget this oath, son.

734
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,280
It's an oath that every honest officer
abides to until his last breath.

735
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,860
We'll never forget.

736
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:47,530
Promise?
- Promise.

737
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,320
Bravo.

738
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:20,740
Jai Hind.

739
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,950
Did you bring the entire force to along
to wish me on 15th August, my friend?

740
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,490
We have a search warrant
against you, Shiv.

741
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:41,450
I know you're an example of honesty
and loyalty for the entire Police force.

742
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,990
But my duty has my hands tied, Shiv.

743
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:59,200
Manish, believe me...I...

744
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:02,450
Sir, this money and drugs are not mine.

745
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,030
If you're corrupt,...
- I...

746
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,160
...then no one in
this world is honest.

747
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:16,240
The motto of our country is
'Satyamev Jayate' for a reason, Shiv.

748
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,530
Manish, I...

749
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:21,320
I know, the truth will
always triumph in the end.

750
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,070
I never imagined that on the
eve of our country's independence...

751
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,160
...my hands will be handcuffed.

752
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,450
Such tall claims about
honesty and bravery.

753
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:38,490
Take a closer look.
That's not a Gallantry award.

754
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,860
It's been given to
your father for corruption.

755
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,240
He's embarrassed all of us.

756
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,530
He pretends to such an honest guy.
Bloody imposter.

757
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,820
He's been booted
out of the Police Force.

758
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,030
He didn't even think
about his two sons.

759
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,610
I heard that he sells in drugs.

760
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,740
His honesty was just a facade.

761
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,530
He belongs in jail.

762
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:02,860
No, Shivansh.

763
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:11,950
Shivansh, what were you doing son?

764
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,280
I will never be like
you when I grow up.

765
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,700
Shiv... Shivansh.

766
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,450
Papa.

767
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,110
Veer. Son...

768
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:49,490
No matter what the world says,
don't believe them.

769
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,070
Your father hasn't
done anything wrong, son.

770
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,700
He's always respected this uniform.

771
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:02,240
I believe you, papa.

772
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,450
Take care of yourself.

773
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:13,410
I...

774
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,450
I shall always be with you.

775
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,450
Are you going somewhere?

776
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:23,160
When will you come back?

777
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:34,160
Go...go inside and play.

778
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,280
You took an oath...

779
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,860
...for your uniform, for your duty.

780
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,610
Now I've taken an oath, father.

781
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:26,110
To restore the lost
honor of this medal.

782
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,860
And, those who don't deserve
to wear this uniform,...

783
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,320
I will burn them to ashes.

784
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:11,410
Which way are you heading?

785
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,490
The gallery.
To prepare for the exhibition.

786
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,740
I'll drop you.
- I have my car.

787
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,610
I've given lifts to criminals.

788
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,700
I can definitely give
you a lift.

789
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,160
Sit.

790
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,990
So did this killer threaten you?

791
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:35,160
Yes...to quit this case.

792
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:39,490
But I know that he knows...that
I am not a quitter.

793
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:41,450
But he still tried.

794
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,450
I think he cares for you.

795
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,860
He should be worried about himself.

796
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,950
Because whenever we cross paths...

797
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:54,110
he shouldn't be expecting
any mercy from me.

798
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,490
Why did we stop at the hospital?

799
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,950
It will only take me 10 minutes.
- Okay.

800
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,780
Sir.

801
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:28,530
Any update?

802
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,360
Brother.

803
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,200
Your phone.

804
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,450
You left it in the car.

805
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,910
I've become so absent-minded.

806
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:53,450
The killer thinks that
he burnt Bhonsle alive.

807
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,110
But he was on the brink of dying.

808
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:02,360
But when God protects,
you can't be harmed.

809
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,200
As soon as he wakes up...

810
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:10,490
...he'll help us prepare a
sketch of the killer and catch him.

811
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,700
The killer doesn't know,...

812
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,660
...that in this game
of cat and mouse...

813
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,610
...I am still one step ahead of him.

814
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,490
Be careful, brother.

815
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:24,240
If I was the killer...

816
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,280
I would be keeping an eye on you.

817
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,160
You would unintentionally
lead him here.

818
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,530
Right to his target.

819
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,530
Don't worry.

820
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:37,610
Okay sir.

821
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,700
Come, sir, I will see you out.

822
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,450
Sure.
- Come on.

823
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:50,240
One...two...three...

824
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,530
What happened?

825
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,450
Missing Madhuri?

826
01:24:55,860 --> 01:25:00,240
Four, five...six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...

827
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,780
Twelve, thirteen...

828
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,360
Brother...I'll join you.

829
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:09,700
"Been counting days..."

830
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,410
Come soon, I am waiting.

831
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,660
One...two...three...

832
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,240
Missing Madhuri?

833
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,360
No, brother.

834
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,360
Four, five...six,
seven, eight, nine...

835
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,610
I think he will recover pretty soon.

836
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:50,990
I hope so.

837
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,910
The killer is flying pretty high.

838
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:57,450
And Bhonsle must live so
that we can clip the killer's wings.

839
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,160
Sir.

840
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,110
This is Dr. Mehta, Burns specialists.

841
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,360
He was looking for you.

842
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:06,610
I'm going upstairs to examine the patient.
- I'll come along too.

843
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:13,070
...nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen...

844
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:45,740
But when God protects,
you can't be harmed.

845
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:53,240
But he who kills for
truth has God's support.

846
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,950
Brother.

847
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,950
Veer! Are you okay?

848
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:29,610
Don't worry about me.

849
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,320
Catch him.

850
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,660
Stay here.

851
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,610
Are you sure you didn't see his face?

852
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,950
No, brother.

853
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,030
He attacked me from behind.
I couldn't see him.

854
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,200
I should've known that
he was watching me closely.

855
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,860
It's not your fault.

856
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,660
He's just very confident.

857
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,660
But his overconfidence
could've cost him today.

858
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,450
We could've caught him today.

859
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,490
He couldn't control his
anger seeing Bhonsle alive.

860
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:28,200
And for the first time,
he attacked without a plan.

861
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:33,110
He may have succeeded,
but this was his first mistake.

862
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,450
Jai Hind, sir.

863
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:47,110
The killer managed to get to Bhonsle
for the second time on your watch.

864
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,660
Believe me, no one's as angry as I am.

865
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:52,110
Something is definitely
driving that killer.

866
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,740
Something in his life
that he thinks was unfair.

867
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,820
He is taking revenge!

868
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,160
Sorry, sir.

869
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:01,820
I'm really sorry.

870
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:05,740
The killer's next target
will be the area starting with 'A'.

871
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,450
This time I won't take any risk.

872
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,450
I will catch him this time.

873
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,070
Even if I have to kill him.

874
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,820
Or give my life for it.

875
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:23,740
Your life is valuable to me, Shivansh.

876
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:28,450
But without results, the situation is
getting really difficult for me to handle.

877
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,530
I understand, sir.

878
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,490
Jai Hind.

879
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:39,450
Another example of
Police incompetence...

880
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:43,530
...in JP Parija hospital, where the killer
broke into the hospital in broad daylight...

881
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:45,740
...and burned Inspector Bhonsle alive.

882
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,360
And for our special report...

883
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:51,320
...around 40 MLAs have been
moved from Gujarat to Karnataka...

884
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:52,820
...and put up in a resort.

885
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:58,910
There are allegations of BJP
trying to buy out the Congress MLAs.

886
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,450
Accusations of Horse-trading are rife.

887
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,990
What nonsense is this?

888
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,530
Does the Commissioner know
that you're bullying us around?

889
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:16,990
Shivansh, this is not the way.

890
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:19,740
You can't just herd
us all in here like sheep.

891
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:21,660
No, you're not.

892
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,950
You're all wolves in sheep's skin

893
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:28,780
Your bulging bellies
and popping buttons...

894
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,700
show how corrupt you've become.

895
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,570
You've managed to get
a sea-facing flat for yourself...

896
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,740
...by threatening slum-dwellers
for the builder's lobby.

897
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:42,700
And you...

898
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:48,610
Thanks to you, the water mafia's
tankers are running amok in the city.

899
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:53,950
But my duty is forcing
me to protect all of you.

900
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:56,410
Do you want to go back to your homes?

901
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:59,910
Do you want to go back to your wife?

902
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,360
Do you want me to let you all go?

903
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:05,860
But will he spare you?

904
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,570
He will turn your bodies to ashes...

905
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:13,160
...and your wives will become widows.

906
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,280
Trying to steal the
tiger's prey is stupidity.

907
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:30,410
But what if someone makes
all the animals disappear.

908
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,740
Then the tiger will turn
towards the city looking for food.

909
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:46,030
We'll make him starve, suffer.

910
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:51,990
And wait for him to
show his face in the city.

911
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,490
What happened?

912
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,700
I think the mirror
didn't like my face.

913
01:32:58,410 --> 01:32:59,950
And did this.

914
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:02,780
How can you joke about this?
- I got it stitched.

915
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:03,780
Come.

916
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,820
Why did you call me if you're alright?

917
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,450
I was having dinner with my friends.

918
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:09,450
Because I need an alibi.

919
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:12,950
When the Police want to know
where I was during the murder...

920
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:15,490
...I can say that I was with you.

921
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:17,950
Wow! That's a new one.

922
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,030
Yes, Shinde. What's up?

923
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,570
I have bad news, sir.

924
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:06,570
Sir...

925
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,490
How did this happen?

926
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,070
Sir...

927
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,910
See for yourself on the CCTV monitor.

928
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,110
According to recent news...

929
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,740
...18 Police officers have been
burnt alive in the Police Safehouse.

930
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,450
DCP Shivansh has failed again.

931
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:24,450
I think a fire broke out somewhere.

932
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,450
See, now you can vouch for me.

933
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:30,200
That I didn't start this fire.

934
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,280
Cheers.

935
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,610
Sir, Inspector Mohan Shrivastav.

936
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:47,110
A year ago, during his posting
in Marine Lines Police station...

937
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:51,450
...he was charged for
raping a college student.

938
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,660
Unfortunately, the girl committed
suicide after a couple of days...

939
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,070
...and the charges were dropped.

940
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,360
And he was reinstated.

941
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,700
But look at what he did today.

942
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,360
He lit a matchstick and
killed everyone including himself.

943
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,240
How did you do it?

944
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:37,110
Even Lord Ram had to take Vibhishan's
help to destroy Ravan's Lanka.

945
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:39,780
I am just a human being.

946
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,570
Just like all my targets...

947
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,030
I was keeping an eye on Shrivastav
for the last couple of months.

948
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:50,820
One day, after he was drunk...

949
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,660
...Shrivastav tried to kill
himself with his service revolver.

950
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,450
He was disgusted with himself.

951
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,360
His wife and child had left him.

952
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:11,030
I made him my Vibhishan,
so when the time comes...

953
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:15,320
...he would burn Ravan's Lanka for me.

954
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:19,450
He had to die.

955
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:23,530
But this way he atoned for his sins.

956
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,780
And anyway, those he killed...

957
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:30,660
...didn't deserve
to wear that uniform.

958
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,450
Their job, their duty...

959
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:42,030
In fact, I am sure they
don't even remember the oath...

960
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:45,320
...they took while
donning this uniform.

961
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:52,360
In the presence of God, I vow...

962
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:00,530
...to always speak the truth.

963
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:03,820
Be fearless.

964
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,360
Be fearless.

965
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,280
Always tread on the
path of righteousness.

966
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,700
I will protect the citizens...

967
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:20,280
and the constitution of
my country according to the Law.

968
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:24,320
Respect the Police
Department and it's officers.

969
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:30,490
And always follow their orders.

970
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,110
I haven't forgotten.

971
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:42,780
I still remember the vow.

972
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:46,240
I'll take another vow today.

973
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,240
Whenever we came face to face...

974
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:57,570
I will personally make
you pay for all your crimes.

975
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,200
But I promise you,...

976
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,910
...the day we meet...

977
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:09,360
...you will clap for me.

978
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:16,780
Let's meet first...

979
01:38:19,610 --> 01:38:21,320
...then I will clap for you.

980
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:31,030
Ladies and Gentlemen,
a huge round of applause...

981
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:35,570
...for the man of the moment, the talented
brilliant artist, Mr. Veer Rathod.

982
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:45,360
Good evening, everyone.

983
01:38:46,030 --> 01:38:47,700
This is a special moment for me...

984
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:52,200
...because everyone I love is
present here to celebrate my success.

985
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:57,030
Especially you, big brother.

986
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,450
The only person I am missing today...

987
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,700
...is my father.

988
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:13,990
All my achievements
are dedicated to you, dad.

989
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,780
My victory is your victory.

990
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,660
Why did you have
to bring up dad's name?

991
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:54,410
Why be ashamed of the
person who gave us our names?

992
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:05,780
And what about the
shame he brought on us?

993
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,660
Inspector Shiv Rathod.

994
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:12,280
25 arrests.

995
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,070
Saved 3 fellow officers on duty.

996
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,200
Awarded the Police Medal of Gallantry.

997
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:26,070
Believe it or not, but this
Shivansh is a part of that Shiv.

998
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:31,740
You remember all the
stories of his honesty, Veer.

999
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:36,200
But what about his dishonesty?

1000
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,450
But I haven't forgotten
how Inspector Shiv Rathod...

1001
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:47,700
...was arrested along with
the bribe money from the drug mafia.

1002
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,820
He was suspended.

1003
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:54,700
His uniform was taken from
him because he didn't deserve it.

1004
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:59,410
And committed he suicide like
a coward, leaving his two sons behind!

1005
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:04,280
I may be a part of him, Veer.

1006
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:10,530
But it took me all these years
to clear his reputation...

1007
01:41:10,610 --> 01:41:12,700
...and to make a name for myself.

1008
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,450
That's the difference
between you and me, brother.

1009
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:23,570
You want to clear your name...

1010
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,320
...and I want to clear his.

1011
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,200
Can I say something?

1012
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,570
I think you're softening, Shivansh.

1013
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:09,240
You're fighting with yourself,
With everyone else.

1014
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:12,030
Because you're unable
to catch that criminal.

1015
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:25,200
Do you also believe that
he's doing the right thing?

1016
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:31,030
Can't believe it.

1017
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:32,570
Shivansh, please.

1018
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,990
Look...

1019
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,660
I don't know who's
right and who isn't.

1020
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:48,410
But I do know that you
two aren't that different.

1021
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,240
You want to change the
system without crossing the line.

1022
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:55,740
So does he, but by breaking the law.

1023
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,910
Limits

1024
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,450
These limits are what separates
us from animals.

1025
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:09,950
The government gives
us a gun and bullets.

1026
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:13,950
But we think twice
before pulling the trigger.

1027
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,110
The day we stop thinking
before pulling the trigger...

1028
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,860
...there will be no difference
between a soldier and a terrorist.

1029
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,110
Limits!

1030
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,450
Thanks for coming tonight.

1031
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:50,030
It was really nice
meeting your family.

1032
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:52,240
They are crazy about you.

1033
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:56,610
Such people become
your reason to live.

1034
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,740
Do you have space for
another reason in life?

1035
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:06,490
I think your parents didn't teach
you that you shouldn't play with fire.

1036
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:07,490
Why?

1037
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,610
Are you scared that
I might burn myself?

1038
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:11,240
No.

1039
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:13,910
I am scared because you will survive.

1040
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,360
And that day, will you love me more...

1041
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,950
...or hate that you love me?

1042
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:24,780
I am ready for both.

1043
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,490
For the hatred...

1044
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:32,700
...and for love.

1045
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:12,950
Wow!

1046
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:16,860
So you can sketch
smiling and happy faces.

1047
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,990
Why didn't you do it before?

1048
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:21,030
I didn't have a reason to.

1049
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,320
So what's next?

1050
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:25,240
Marriage and lots of babies?

1051
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,990
One big happy family.

1052
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:32,660
Is it really that easy
to have a happy family?

1053
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:46,660
It's not.

1054
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:50,990
Sometimes your father beats
up your mother in a fit of rage.

1055
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:55,450
And sometimes the mother leaves her
husband and 8-year-old daughter behind...

1056
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:57,030
...and commits suicide.

1057
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:00,860
And sometimes, that child grows up...

1058
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,160
...and tries to find
her smile on someones canvas.

1059
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,030
I am sorry.

1060
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,160
I've been living away
from dad for 15 years.

1061
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:15,070
So do you still love your dad?

1062
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:20,200
Some relationships are your weakness,
not your necessity.

1063
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,910
So what is your necessity?

1064
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:23,740
Do I need to say it?

1065
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,780
This will be the right opportunity
for the killer to strike.

1066
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:31,570
And one of these five Police
officers will be his next target.

1067
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:34,450
Our officers will accompany
them in plain clothes.

1068
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:37,610
So this time he cannot
give us the slip.

1069
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:43,910
What is this, old man?

1070
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:48,320
The bundles are getting
lighter every time.

1071
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:50,780
Business is slow.

1072
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:52,360
Father.

1073
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,450
Your medicines.

1074
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:57,700
You always forget them.

1075
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:02,490
Old man, if business is slow...

1076
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:06,450
...then why not let
her run the business?

1077
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:08,360
What are you saying?

1078
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,490
Move, father.

1079
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:14,320
Now I run the business.

1080
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:20,530
But unfortunately, we don't sell
that one thing that you need the most.

1081
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:23,990
Manners!

1082
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:27,410
And you should've
learned from your mother.

1083
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,610
How dare you insult my mother?

1084
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,820
Because you didn't
learn anything from her.

1085
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:37,570
Now I'll teach you manners.

1086
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:23,990
"O light of God!"

1087
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:28,240
"May I be graced by Your benevolence"

1088
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:31,990
"O God!"

1089
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:35,910
"May there be strength in my prayers"

1090
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:47,990
"The condition of my heart
is obvious to You, O Prophet!"

1091
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:52,360
"We will bow down our
heads in front of You and say"

1092
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:55,910
"O King of the holy sanctuary!"

1093
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:59,490
"O King of the holy sanctuary!"

1094
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:04,070
"With eyes full of benevolence"

1095
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:07,110
"O King of the holy sanctuary! "

1096
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:11,740
"O King of the holy sanctuary!"

1097
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:16,030
"With eyes full of benevolence"

1098
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:23,860
"The hearts of us poor
ones will also blossom"

1099
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:27,410
"O patron of the poor! "

1100
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:31,740
"What will the world say?"

1101
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:39,530
"If I go back empty
handed from Your doorstep"

1102
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:42,280
"O King of the holy sanctuary!"

1103
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,490
Hello Shivansh sir,
We can't find him anywhere.

1104
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:45,200
What do you mean you can't find him?

1105
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:48,240
You had one job,
and you couldn't do that either.

1106
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,740
Father!

1107
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:02,200
Leave me!

1108
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,200
Father!

1109
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,740
You wanted to teach me manners.

1110
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,820
Whether she's wearing
a sari or a burka...

1111
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:22,360
...women are worshiped
as Goddesses in our culture.

1112
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:28,950
And we kill anyone who
disrespects our Goddess.

1113
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,160
Beat him, brother. Beat him.

1114
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:28,530
Beat him.

1115
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:38,490
Hit him.

1116
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:42,200
Hit him.

1117
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:57,240
See how strong a woman can be.

1118
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:05,530
Now no man will ever taunt
anyone saying, "Are you a girl"?

1119
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:08,990
Run.

1120
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:11,780
Run.

1121
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,740
Deception has a speciality.

1122
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:02,990
It often comes from
someone close.

1123
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,030
When did you start doubting me?

1124
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,820
On the night of the exhibition.

1125
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:16,450
When we argued about
dad and I returned home...

1126
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:19,610
I was feeling really bad.

1127
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,240
I tried calling you.

1128
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:26,530
I went back to the exhibition.

1129
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:31,160
Then I noticed your paintings.

1130
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,740
And then those faces.

1131
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:36,320
All those officers.

1132
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,740
That you killed.

1133
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,610
Doubts often turn to reality.

1134
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:54,910
But I never wanted
my doubts to turn out to be true.

1135
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,740
Surrender yourself.

1136
01:56:01,410 --> 01:56:02,490
I will.

1137
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,910
But not right now.

1138
01:56:06,070 --> 01:56:08,490
I have one move left
in this game.

1139
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:12,860
It's the reason why
I started this game.

1140
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:14,490
Don't be crazy.

1141
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:18,820
You don't have any
aces left to win this game.

1142
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:25,610
A game is won using the queen,
not the ace.

1143
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:26,700
Veer.

1144
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:27,660
Veer, stop.

1145
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:29,820
Veer.

1146
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:31,860
Veer.

1147
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:35,490
Veer, stop.

1148
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,570
Veer.

1149
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:50,660
Veer.

1150
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:06,700
I can't believe it, Shivansh...

1151
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:11,450
...that your brother
Veer is the killer.

1152
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,910
I can't believe it either, sir.

1153
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:20,610
Excuse me, sir.

1154
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:27,360
Leave me, Veer.

1155
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:28,740
Shikha?

1156
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:40,740
I told you this game could only be
won using the queen and not the ace.

1157
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:42,280
Veer...

1158
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:45,410
...if anything happens
to my daughter...

1159
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:55,610
I knew that someday she would
come in handy to defeat the king.

1160
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,910
I am waiting for you
where it all started.

1161
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:08,160
I hope you two are
smart to come unarmed.

1162
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:15,110
Otherwise, you'll lose your daughter
in the same place I lost my father.

1163
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:40,160
Shivansh.

1164
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,780
Everyone Veer killed so far...

1165
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,950
...were corrupt and not innocent.

1166
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:51,610
But I still did my duty.

1167
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,490
I tried to protect them.

1168
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:01,490
And I'll protect you too.

1169
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:06,780
But everyone who's broken
the Law will be punished.

1170
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:11,570
Whether it's Veer or you.

1171
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,660
He did say come unarmed.

1172
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:38,700
Come.

1173
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:05,110
Remember anything, brother?

1174
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:12,410
This is where we held on to
our father's arms and learned to walk.

1175
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:19,490
These walls were witnesses
of his innocence.

1176
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:23,780
This tricolor flag...

1177
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,660
which he hoisted so proudly.

1178
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:31,160
And this is the same place...

1179
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:34,860
where he turned to ashes.

1180
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:39,240
Nothing has changed.

1181
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,320
Commissioner!

1182
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:46,610
Come forward.

1183
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:48,110
Veer.
- Brother.

1184
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:16,360
Pick up the can of kerosene.

1185
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:19,450
Pick it up!

1186
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:29,490
Now pour it on yourself.

1187
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:51,240
Now let's play a game.

1188
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,070
Called 'Satyamev Jayate'.

1189
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,610
If you lie...

1190
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,780
...you die.

1191
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:09,200
So let's begin?

1192
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:13,570
Was our father corrupt?

1193
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:18,030
No.

1194
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:24,950
Was his best friend, his colleague,

1195
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:28,240
meaning you...

1196
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:32,450
...behind falsely implicating him?

1197
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,110
Yes.

1198
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,160
Why did you implicate my father?

1199
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:52,030
Shiv...was too honest.

1200
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:58,910
He wouldn't accept any bribe,
nor would he let us.

1201
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,530
And so you killed him.

1202
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:04,990
I didn't kill Shiv, Veer.

1203
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,450
Shivansh.

1204
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,740
I never wanted Shiv to kill himself.

1205
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:18,160
A man whose entire life was dedicated
to his honesty, and his duty.

1206
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:21,360
What else did you expect him
to do other than give up his life?

1207
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:30,530
You didn't pour kerosene on
my father and light the matchstick.

1208
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:34,700
But you were the reason he did this.

1209
02:03:40,450 --> 02:03:42,740
You took him away from us.

1210
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:16,160
I said...

1211
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,160
I will clear dad's name.

1212
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,280
Here I am DCP, arrest me.

1213
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,910
Sorry, Shivansh!

1214
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:58,610
But the Law is blind and stupid.

1215
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,700
These are the officers...

1216
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:06,320
who were on your brother's
list to complete 'Satyamev Jayate'.

1217
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:14,410
The most corrupt and disloyal cops.

1218
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:22,160
I didn't pour kerosene on
your father and light the matchstick.

1219
02:05:23,570 --> 02:05:26,910
But I will turn you
two brothers to ashes.

1220
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:37,490
The world will assume
that you two killed each other.

1221
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:41,030
One became a martyr
while upholding the Law...

1222
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:45,030
while the other died
for breaking the law.

1223
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:58,280
Veer!

1224
02:05:58,490 --> 02:06:00,570
Veer!

1225
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:04,740
Veer!

1226
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:10,910
Fire.

1227
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:18,450
Don't spare him.

1228
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,910
Are you alright, brother?
- Don't worry about me.

1229
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:39,280
Veer!

1230
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,700
No!

1231
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,990
Stop. Don't try to take
the Law in your hands again, Veer.

1232
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:52,070
Veer!

1233
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:53,200
Veer!

1234
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,070
Veer! Stop!

1235
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:17,700
Stop, Veer!

1236
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,660
The Law will punish him!

1237
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:20,860
No!

1238
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:28,490
I will kill him myself.

1239
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:33,780
And complete my mission
which is 'Satyamev Jayate'.

1240
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:38,070
Look...
I will shoot you, Veer.

1241
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:39,740
Veer.

1242
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:44,160
You won't shoot me.

1243
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:51,280
I will shoot you, Veer.

1244
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:52,820
Veer!

1245
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:01,200
I will shoot you, Veer.

1246
02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,530
I will shoot you.

1247
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,280
Veer!

1248
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:30,490
Veer!

1249
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:21,450
Satyamev Jayate!

1250
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:28,610
The sentiment of Satyamev Jayate
literally runs in your family's blood.

1251
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,320
Law. Duty.

1252
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:42,160
These shallow sentiments
drove one brother to shoot another.

1253
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,490
The killer has turned
to ashes himself.

1254
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:53,490
Come on, arrest me.

1255
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:59,160
I will be out before your
brother's memorial service.

1256
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:08,360
Truth doesn't triumph here,
Power does.

1257
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:16,700
And Power comes to those who have
the ability to influence this system.

1258
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:27,490
Come on. Arrest me.

1259
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:29,280
Come on.

1260
02:12:30,660 --> 02:12:33,280
Handcuff me. Come on.

1261
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:34,700
Come on.

1262
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:36,820
Arrest me.

1263
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:38,360
Come on.

1264
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:40,110
Handcuff me.

1265
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:42,610
Come on.

1266
02:12:42,910 --> 02:12:43,780
Come on.

1267
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,110
Arrest me.

1268
02:13:46,450 --> 02:13:47,200
Veer!

1269
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:49,450
Veer! You'll be fine.

1270
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:51,820
I'll take you to the hospital.

1271
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:54,530
No, brother.
- Come on.

1272
02:13:59,570 --> 02:14:01,070
I am lucky...

1273
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:05,240
...that I didn't die by the
hands of a coward and corrupt man.

1274
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:10,030
But by the hands of an honest officer.

1275
02:14:10,990 --> 02:14:12,660
You'll be okay!

1276
02:14:14,570 --> 02:14:15,990
You'll be okay!

1277
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:19,950
Like I said...

1278
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:25,030
Either you'll love me...

1279
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:27,450
Veer!

1280
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:29,280
...or hate that you love me.

1281
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:33,780
Whatever you do...

1282
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:39,700
I hope you'll forgive me.

1283
02:14:42,110 --> 02:14:46,450
Let's go, you'll be okay.

1284
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:50,570
Brother, let's...

1285
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:57,820
fulfill our father's dream one last time.
- Veer!

1286
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:07,200
In the presence of God,
I solemnly vow...

1287
02:15:07,450 --> 02:15:10,530
In the presence of God,
I solemnly vow...

1288
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:14,610
In the presence of God,
I solemnly vow...

1289
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:16,990
...to always speak the truth.

1290
02:15:17,410 --> 02:15:19,860
...to always speak the truth.

1291
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:22,740
...to always speak the truth.

1292
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:25,360
Be fearless.

1293
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:27,700
Be fearless.

1294
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:30,320
Be fearless.

1295
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:34,030
Walk on the path of righteousness.

1296
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:37,240
Walk on the path of righteousness.

1297
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:40,700
Walk on the path of righteousness.

1298
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:45,030
I will protect the citizens...

1299
02:15:56,110 --> 02:15:57,280
Veer.

1300
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:04,820
Brother.

1301
02:16:04,910 --> 02:16:05,490
Veer.

1302
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,490
Veer.

1303
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,160
Veer!

1304
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:11,410
Veer!

1305
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:18,570
Veer!

1306
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:47,030
Veer!
