1
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,440
Mr. Sabbarwal, we've found
patient's case history.

2
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
And, we've started the process immediately.

3
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,640
Doctor, please!
- I will try my best Mr. Sabbarwal.

4
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Keep faith, everything will be fine.

5
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,560
Yes Jatin..

6
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,680
Did you reach the hospital?

7
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
Yes, just now.

8
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
What are the doctors saying?

9
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
They've begun with their process.

10
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,079
I hope everything goes well.

11
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,680
Anyway let's meet and talk further.

12
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll be there in 20minutes.

13
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,520
What!

14
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
Are you crazy?

15
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
There's no need of you to come here.

16
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,040
Swati, my name is printed as a
chief guest on the invitation.

17
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,519
Banners are published, media has
featured it, and in such case..

18
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
If I don't reach at the book launch it's
going to be very bad for your publication's image.

19
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Are you sure?
- Swati!

20
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Everything, of a sudden...

21
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,240
Jatin, think once again.

22
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Yes, I'm coming.

23
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,400
I would like to request Mr. Sabbarwal to come here
and share his views on the book 'AKS'.

24
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jatin Sabbarwal.

25
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,160
Thank you Mr. Dew.

26
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm overwhelmed to be here.

27
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,040
My dad says, it's difficult to find good friends..

28
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
..and it's much difficult to find true friends!

29
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,479
Today, we're in the net age.

30
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,160
Today we're equipped with
infinite sources of contact!

31
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,440
Visit the internet and any social networking
site and you can make many friends!

32
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,320
In short, today the easiest
thing is to make friends.

33
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,480
But, what dad says is
as important to me even today.

34
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,719
That one true friend is, was and
will always be easily available.

35
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Books!

36
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Books, they eradicate our loneliness
and sometimes also guide us.

37
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,680
They help us from committing any wrong
and sometimes inspire us to be right!

38
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
A complete true friend.

39
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Books!

40
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,880
I convey warm regards to Panchi,
the writer of this novel.

41
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,240
I hope this novel will help
us reflect our real selves.

42
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,960
So, let's read few lines
of it and know it better.

43
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,640
I am a bird, beginning
with small take offs.

44
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,400
In search of something while I fly,

45
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,919
I am a Bird!

46
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,000
A bird who will tell you a
strange story about the destiny.

47
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,400
A story that tells how this
bird cuts off her wings by herself.

48
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,840
A bird, who shows the
unlike reflection of circumstances.

49
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,120
I am bird, telling story of a bird!

50
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
I am a Bird...

51
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,480
Jatin!
Jatin, what happened?

52
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,720
What happened?

53
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,360
I want to meet Panchi, right now!
Where can I find her? What's her address?

54
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
But what's the matter Jatin?
Of a sudden you're like...

55
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Swati please! I don't have time to explain
you everything, I want to meet Panchi.

56
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
Where can I find her?
What's her address

57
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't know!
- What you mean you don't know?

58
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
She's your writer, you have
published her book!

59
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,760
You must have met her, spoken to her,
also must have signed a contract..

60
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,320
..and many other legal formalities
must have been performed.

61
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
Definitely you should have her
name, number, address, something!

62
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
We do not have it!
- What do you mean you don't have it?

63
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,040
We don't have any details of her
neither anybody knows Panchi.

64
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
We received this script of the
book 'AKS' as a courier.

65
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,760
Our creative department is been
handled by Mr. Dibakar.

66
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,960
He found it interesting and is the one
who decided to publish it as a book.

67
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
In fact, Even I  haven't
read this book until now.

68
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,680
I want to meet Mr. Dibakar,
right now.

69
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,320
Ma'am, writer Panchi just
has a sole post box number.

70
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
Other official formalities have been
performed through this post box number.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
I need that post box number.

72
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes ma'am.

73
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,640
19567.

74
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,960
This post box number number belongs to
Mumbai, near some area known as Laxmi nagar.

75
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,839
Jatin, wait!

76
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Thank you.
- Okay.

77
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,880
We're friends and considering the same
I at least hold a right to know..

78
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,600
..how do you know Panchi?

79
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,360
Why are you so eager to meet her?

80
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,760
Why are you behaving
so mysterious about her?

81
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,560
Swati, read this book.

82
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,080
You'll find answers for
all your questions in this.

83
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,520
Yes Dad!
- Jatin, where are you?

84
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,840
Dad, I'm here at...
- You should be here at the moment.

85
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay Dad, I'm coming.

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,520
Dedicated to my beloved Rabbit.

87
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,840
I remember, he said it once,
'Life changes every moment'.

88
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,319
And, every moment has an
ability to change everything!

89
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,800
But may be he was unaware, that, destiny
is something between past and future.

90
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,280
Fate reveals it's decision
during this moment!

91
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,760
For us, it was decided
by our fate quite soon!

92
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,280
That fine day, at Himachal's Police station,
destiny knocked in for the first time!

93
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,400
This age and moreover this tyranny!

94
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,320
That almighty behaves
so disheartening at times.

95
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
Why did you come here?

96
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
I've come here to file a report.

97
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
You can talk!

98
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
Yes, definitely! I can talk.

99
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,800
Also, you can hear.

100
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,680
Very well!

101
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,360
So why were you talking in
gestures like a dumb and deaf?

102
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Because you were talking in gestures
so I thought that you're...

103
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,400
That I'm deaf!

104
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,760
Pal, I was eating a paan.

105
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Which shouldn't be in an on duty
police officer's mouth..

106
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,080
..when you're on duty while talking to
public, right?

107
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,760
Police officer, Manoj Kumar.

108
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,520
You've to file a report regarding what?

109
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,480
Sir, actually...
- Tell me.

110
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,880
Sir, I've lost my camera.

111
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
So, you're a photographer?

112
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,720
No sir, I'm a student of law,
I'm just fond Photography.

113
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,560
Thought, will visit a beautiful place,
but sir..

114
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,800
..I wasn't aware, even Himachal
isn't safe like other places.

115
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
Who said this?

116
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,440
Himachal is safe! and your
camera is lost and isn't robbed.

117
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,920
Sir, what's the guarantee? it's
possible that someone must have robbed it.

118
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,520
That's not possible.

119
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,720
That's not possible.

120
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,959
In our city we treat our guests as god.

121
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,880
So, god's belongings are robbed like this?

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,920
No, nothing like this,
you'll get your belonging back.

123
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Tell me the name.

124
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,840
Canon DSLR

125
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,040
Huh?
- C A NON  DS LR.

126
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,000
You have a really different name.

127
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,000
Sir, this isn't my name.
It's camera's name.

128
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,560
I asked your name.
- Sir, so say like that.

129
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,040
Jatin Sabbarwal.

130
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,079
Give me complete details.

131
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,240
Where, when and why did you go?
Tell me everything.

132
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,360
Sir... - Wait for a moment,
you made me spit the paan.

133
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,160
Dara, hey Dara.
where does he go!

134
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,200
You stay here. I'll come in 2 minutes,
some important work.

135
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,960
Dara, hey Dara...

136
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,160
Hello, listen...
Oh no!

137
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,680
What happened?
Everything's alright?

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,720
I received your message
at the hotel that you're here.

139
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
But what are you doing here?

140
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Hello! I'm talking to you?

141
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Hey, Gullu, what happened?

142
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
What are you doing here?

143
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,000
Where?

144
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,760
Here, at the park! Pal, I mean
here at the police station?

145
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
Actually pal, I'd come here to file a report.

146
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Report, about what?

147
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,600
My camera is misplaced.

148
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,000
When?
- Yesterday.

149
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
You lost the camera yesterday and
you're telling me this now!

150
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,720
So when should I tell you?

151
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Do you have any spare
time left apart from boozing?

152
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,720
Yes, but I've come here to have fun
and boozing comes under having fun.

153
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,640
That's why! Hey pal, I don't want
to click those wild animals as you do.

154
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
You just can't!
Come on, come.

155
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,440
What are you doing? listen to me.
- Come with me.

156
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,840
Listen...
What are you doing?

157
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,040
Hey, camera! - What?
- My camera.

158
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,640
But you told me your camera is...

159
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Hey, you're here and I'm
searching for you inside.

160
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,880
You're weird.

161
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,640
Sir, I found my camera.
Right here, on this table.

162
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,280
A girl had come here to return this
camera, she found it at Chamera lake.

163
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
Yes, I'd visited there yesterday.

164
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,480
I'd told you,..

165
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,080
..that, you will get your camera back,
that too misplaced and not robbed.

166
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,520
Ma'am, that girl, who was she?

167
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,280
Who knows who is she, she came over,
returned the camera and left.

168
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,120
Yes, that's fine but you would've
asked  her name, address, something.

169
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,520
She'd come here just to return
the camera, she wasn't a thief!

170
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Correct! hey you found
your camera, now let's go.

171
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,840
Thank you!

172
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
Hey, she has returned my camera
so at least she is worth a Thank you.

173
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Shut up!

174
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,840
Say thank you us, when we
happen to meet her, we'll pass it on.

175
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
Right Kumari?
- Yes sir.

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes, that's absolutely correct.
Absolutely!

177
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,200
Thank you giving Himachal police an
opportunity to serve you.

178
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Hello! - Hello, Jatin where are you?
I'm trying your phone since long.

179
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,240
Listen, our flight is in
Sometime. Come soon.

180
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Hello, Jatin.
- Yes, I'm coming.

181
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,399
Hey, Dew!
- Congratulations Sabbarwal.

182
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,640
Namaste sister-in-law!
- Namaste.

183
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,440
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

184
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,560
So there's this another sixer!

185
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
You've won this case also.

186
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,800
To be honest, I wasn't too sure this time.

187
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,560
A very important case and
everyone had their attention to it.

188
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,400
But he did it.
I'm really happy and proud.

189
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,360
Most lucky of all are his clients as
they appoint an advocate like him.

190
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,840
There are two kinds of advocates.

191
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,880
One who knows the law. - And other?
- Who knows the judge!

192
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,040
Can't see Swati around.
- She must be on her way.

193
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,480
One more.

194
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
Gullu, enough, or else you'll burst.

195
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Look, drink until you burst and
live until you burst.

196
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,240
And then live until you burst
and drink until you burst.

197
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,760
Why are you bothered?
Your father hasn't sponsored this.

198
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,800
My father has sponsored it.

199
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,000
Is it!

200
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Look, your father is like my father.

201
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,720
So then if my father has sponsored
this why are you bothered?

202
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,560
Hi Jatin!

203
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,960
Hey! Swati.

204
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,720
When did you come back?

205
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,400
Last night from America and
few minutes ago in the party.

206
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,680
Give me a hug, Hi.
- Hi fatso.

207
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,399
Hi.

208
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
Let's go and talk upstairs.

209
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Cheers!

210
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,520
Hey, change the glass.

211
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,080
Our kids have grown up now!
Need to think about them.

212
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,040
I missed you! Two friends
and both of them of no use.

213
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:15,080
One, went America and other, "Drink until
you burst and live until you burst".

214
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,440
With whom should I share my feelings?

215
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,520
Why? isn't there anyone special in your
life to share your feelings?

216
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,760
May be not yet.
- No!

217
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,200
Because, just tell right away
if there's someone..

218
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,720
..as our Parents are trying to fix our alliance.

219
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,720
No!

220
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,920
Well, it was my duty to warn you!

221
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,159
Hey, just deny it.

222
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,400
If you have any problem
you deny for it.

223
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,400
It means, you have no problem with it?

224
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,360
No! They're our Parents.
They will definitely think of our good.

225
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,040
Anyways, I'm a pure Indian cultured girl.
Parent's decision is god's decision.

226
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,440
Wooah!
Ideal woman.

227
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,760
Listen, I've to complete my Law studies
and you've to complete your course.

228
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,320
Don't drag me into all this.

229
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,400
So go! Go and file a case against your
Parents, protest and fight for your right.

230
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,680
May be you'll win it.

231
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,480
What happened?

232
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,480
It tastes weird.

233
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,720
Really?
Vodka exactly tastes this.

234
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Jatin!

235
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,520
Congrats Dad!

236
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Thanks!

237
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,520
You know son
- Yes.

238
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,440
I was 25 years old.
- Yes.

239
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,240
When I saw your mom
for the first time!

240
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,280
She was shopping at a shop.

241
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,760
There were butterflies in my stomach
the moment I saw her.

242
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,280
I approached her the same moment,
and you know what I did?

243
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,280
I proposed her to marry me.

244
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
What!
-Yes.

245
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,000
Not only this,
I caught hold of her hand.

246
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,440
wow, directly?!
- Directly.

247
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,240
Dad, what happened next?

248
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,760
Son, what happened next
was something strange!

249
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,760
I held her hand in mine and we
were lost into each other.

250
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,400
It was hard to distinguish
our intertwine fingers.

251
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,440
I said to her,

252
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,640
'There's a beautiful moon up high in the
sky and other at my eyesight'!

253
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,879
Will you marry me?

254
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,720
That's it!

255
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,840
Wow dad!

256
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,640
It's a bit filmy, right?

257
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,000
Yes, it is a bit filmy.

258
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,320
Wow!

259
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,440
But dad, looking at you it doesn't
seem you can be this romantic.

260
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
Hey! shall I punch you one.

261
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,960
Dad, it's very unfair.

262
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,480
You have a great loves story
but trying to couple me with Swati!

263
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Don't do this, I mean I never
thought of her like girl of my life!

264
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,200
Dear, it's not me but your mom who's
trying to couple you with her.

265
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
She is the one after you to get married.

266
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,600
Anyways, you need not worry.

267
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,120
Enjoy your time and think of
marrying anytime later you wish to.

268
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,120
Thank you Dad!

269
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,800
Listen to me.
- Minister is heading here.

270
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,280
Will you both stay here all night long.

271
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Finish it up and go to sleep.

272
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,240
Home minister,
we'll be there in sometime.

273
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,400
No, now, right now!

274
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,320
My dear dictator let me
at least finish the glass.

275
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,080
I said, right now!

276
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,160
Okay my son.

277
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Listen to me, it's Mr. Mehta's case
hearing tomorrow so accompany me.

278
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,200
Okay, good night!
- Good night dad.

279
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,880
As time would've passed,
Himachal's meet

280
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,560
might have been like a beautiful memory for him.

281
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,280
until the destiny wouldn't have
plans for us to come across again!

282
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Until the day he wouldn't
have seen me once again.

283
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,800
Hey Gullu where are you?

284
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
It's been an hour I'm waiting for you.

285
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,960
Come soon...

286
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
Yes, it's okay.

287
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,360
We met;
we met once again!

288
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,880
But both of us never thought we
would meet up this way!

289
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Hi!

290
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,960
Brother, can you just pass on that
I want to meet that girl in orange.

291
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Brother, just pass on ahead he wants
to meet that girl in orange.

292
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
He wants to meet.

293
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,280
He wants to meet.

294
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Wants to meet.

295
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,720
Wants to meet.

296
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,400
He wants to meet.

297
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,720
Wants to meet.

298
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,040
What happened?
- Wants to meet.

299
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,160
Wants to meet.

300
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,080
He's calling you.

301
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,280
Let him go to hell!

302
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,360
Pen?

303
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,240
Hey brother, you should have
Seen the print! Take this paper.

304
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Just write there,
to stay away from me.

305
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
Will you like enjoy a slap?

306
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
Please stop the bus.

307
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
What? what's your problem?
Why are you after me?

308
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
I had to talk to you.

309
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,080
What do you mean?

310
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
There in Himachal...

311
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,840
Himachal, what?

312
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,520
My camera!

313
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
What camera?

314
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,560
You'd returned my camera
there at the police station.

315
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
So?

316
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,200
I got my camera
back because of you.

317
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
So!

318
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,040
I wanted to say thank you to you.

319
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,040
You mean to say you came all the way
from Himachal to Mumbai to say thank you?

320
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,360
No, no, I stay here in Mumbai at Juhu.

321
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm waiting.

322
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,639
Waiting for what?

323
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,080
For you to say thank you, what else?

324
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,240
Thank you!

325
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,200
You're done with your thank you?

326
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
So now there's no need
of you to follow me, correct!

327
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,080
So I'll go my way and
you should go yours!

328
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,080
Let's go.

329
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Please listen to me.
Listen please...

330
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Auto...

331
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,600
I'd clicked some pictures of you at Himachal,
they're are beautiful, would you like to see?

332
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,240
You're trying a wrong number!
you'll just waste your time on me.

333
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,679
Try these kiddish ways with someone
else, probably you might get some girl.

334
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,000
You get that!

335
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Hey wait!

336
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,640
Don't come after me henceforth.

337
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,800
Barkhaa let's go.
Barkhaa, come let's go.

338
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Stupid!

339
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
Barkhaa!

340
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,040
So, you met this girl at Himachal's
police station for the first time.

341
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,080
In fact you didn't even meet
her but just had a glimpse.

342
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,600
Yes.

343
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,080
Second time, you saw her at the market place.

344
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,160
Where you again had a glimpse of her.

345
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Yes.

346
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,440
Third time, you met her here at Mumbai.

347
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:33,080
Where you both saw each other and
she asked you to never try to see her.

348
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
Tell me, did she say this?

349
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
Yes, she said this. So?

350
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,360
I mean so much has happened
and you didn't tell me.

351
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,960
What I should have told you?

352
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Even I'm unable to understand
what's happening.

353
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,920
In fact, I'm still unable to understand
what's all happening with me?

354
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,280
When I saw her at Himachal's
police station for the first time,

355
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
that moment something happened!

356
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,160
Something, something weird

357
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,480
something like...
Just happened!

358
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,800
I just know that my
heartbeats could echo in my ears.

359
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,720
I kept looking at her and felt
like not to stop...

360
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,880
And the moment she left,
everything was finished!

361
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,200
I'll tell you something?

362
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,040
I've just seen all this
happening in movies,

363
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,280
that a boy has a glimpse of a girl
for the first time and that's it!

364
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,920
He falls in love with her.

365
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,080
But pal, this is actually
happening with you.

366
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,399
Your brains stops functioning
when your heart falls in love.

367
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,040
That's fine but what will you
Do now? How will you find her?

368
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,600
Her friend referred her as Barkhaa!
- So?

369
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,159
So, let's search.

370
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,560
Dad!

371
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,800
Yes dad.

372
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,520
Where are you son?

373
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,199
Dad, I'm here at the office flat.

374
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,840
Dear, Aazam uncle's friend Mr. Shetty

375
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,159
is messed up in a property case.

376
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,040
I want you to reach Commissioner’s office
immediately and solve this problem.

377
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Sure dad.

378
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,280
Stay rest assured, your file has
been sent to the right person.

379
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,920
As well I've personally
taken care of it.

380
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,440
Now, there's no need to worry,
your job will be done.

381
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,799
Thank you! - There's no
need for a thank you.

382
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,200
I can do anything for Mr. Sabbarwal.

383
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,480
And, when will you fix the
meeting with the Commissioner?

384
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't take tension about the meeting.

385
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,400
He is out for half an hour for lunch.

386
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,240
As soon he returns,
your meeting is done.

387
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,279
It will be done.

388
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,279
Uh, Beer?
- Coffee.

389
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,280
Dude, I've never seen a bore like you.

390
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,360
Barkhaa!

391
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,960
Barkhaa, Barkhaa, Barkhaa...

392
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,480
That's too much
for now, let's go.

393
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,480
Mr. Shetty
- Yes.

394
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
Your problem has been resolved.

395
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
Take this, all the NOCs of
your business.

396
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Thank you sir.

397
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,960
I was sure you will resolve my
problem but this soon...

398
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,880
Thank you sir.

399
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,920
Sir, your fees.

400
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,160
That's not needed! Your friend
Mr. Azam on who's recommendation

401
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,600
I accepted this case, is a
good friend of mine as well.

402
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
Please don't bother.

403
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,880
But sir, fees...
- Just let it be.

404
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,880
Excuse me.

405
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,640
Sir...

406
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Hello! Yes, yes, yes. I'll take
care of it sir, please don't worry.

407
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,160
But fees...

408
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,480
Sir, even you helped, right?

409
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,960
Then, fees is a must.

410
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,680
No sir, sir keep it with you.
Trust me, there's no need.

411
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,560
Dad told you, right!
More than enough.

412
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,359
Okay, not fees but you have
to agree on one thing, please don't deny.

413
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
No, no, sure!

414
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,320
Hey pal, what's this?

415
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,720
Where did you bring me?

416
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,360
This is brother's bar.

417
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,320
Actually, we did not
charge him with the fee.

418
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,160
So, he wants us to visit
his bar for 10 minutes

419
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,080
and give him the honor
to be thankful to us.

420
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,480
He will feel relieved.

421
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,880
Gullu you know I
don't like...

422
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,440
You don't like it, I know!

423
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,640
So, we ain't going to spend
a holiday here!

424
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,440
We'll go there for 10-15 minutes,
enjoy 1 beer and leave.

425
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,520
If dad comes to know
this, you know it well.

426
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
How will uncle come to know about it

427
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,560
as if we're giving a breaking news
on a national TV channel.

428
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,600
No, right? Come on
pal, let's go.

429
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,120
Please leave all this,
come on.

430
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,640
Come with me please.
- Yes, coming. Go ahead.

431
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Sorry sir, you cannot go inside.

432
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,360
Cannot go inside, why?

433
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
There's a private party going on inside.

434
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,800
Private party will be for us, because we...

435
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He?

436
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,160
But, brother had invited us.

437
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,120
Sir, you won't be allowed. Sorry!

438
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,520
Gullu, let's leave.
He said it's closed, come.

439
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
What let's leave.
Wait for a minute.

440
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,919
Cannot go inside!

441
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,240
Brother, what is this?
We're outside your bar

442
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,000
but the guard isn't
allowing us inside.

443
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,640
He's saying some private
party is going on.

444
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,280
Look at this, Junior Sabbarwal
got annoyed and left.

445
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
Please come soon.

446
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,680
Hey Jatin! please wait.

447
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,480
Don't get annoyed,
please wait.

448
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,200
See, even brother's here.

449
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,600
Oh sorry, sorry, really
sorry.

450
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,160
These are donkeys!

451
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,760
He couldn't recognize my
special guests.

452
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,800
Please come in.

453
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,360
Brother, I'm not leaving because of him.

454
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,879
Be it any reason but please
come in once, I insist.

455
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
Sorry, sorry! Please give
me a chance to thank you.

456
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,200
Come in.
- Correct! let's go.

457
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,120
Hey you, I'd told you my friends
will come over a special guests!

458
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
In spite of that you blocked them out!

459
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,040
Sorry brother.
- You, what to say now.

460
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,200
Be careful henceforth.

461
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,760
Please come.
- Let's go.

462
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm on leave tomorrow onwards.
- Really.

463
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,880
Gullu, let's leave from here.

464
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,240
Pal, come on!

465
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Please come in,
have a seat.

466
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,720
Brother, your bar is lovely!

467
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,560
Almighty's blessings.

468
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,960
Brother, dance bars were banned, right?

469
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,680
So then?

470
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,560
Dance is banned in the bar,
not the stomach's hunger.

471
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,200
And which law takes into
consideration the hunger?

472
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
And what about the police men out?

473
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,720
This is fun of law and order.
- What do you mean?

474
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,400
Means, they have an order

475
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,640
to keep a check if
there's dance going on.

476
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,279
Now-a-days this is important
to them

477
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,560
rather to have a single
men where it's truly required.

478
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,680
Do you see any police men
outside an ATM? - No.

479
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,920
Outside a bank, jewelery shop,
housing society?

480
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,480
but in a dance bar a police man
has to be there! - Yes, right.

481
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Security purpose.

482
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Leave all this. Hey listen,
is there someone out?

483
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,920
Coming sir.

484
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,080
Tell me sir, what will you have?

485
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,760
Beer, rum, whiskey, vodka?

486
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,000
No, I won't have anything.
Thank you.

487
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,800
Nothing, no sir.
Please have something.

488
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,799
Sir, really I...
- Correct!

489
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,520
If you don't drink anything
after coming in a bar,

490
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,920
that's an insult for a bar.

491
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,600
Brother, I'll opt for a beer.

492
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,240
Very good and what about you?
- I won't have anything.

493
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,680
No, no, even he'll take a beer.

494
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,160
Very good!
Get 2 chilled beer.

495
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,640
Let's go.

496
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Brother, can we go and sit
downstairs at the floor?

497
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
Actually, I'm unable to
get that feel here.

498
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,640
Sir, you can sit wherever you like.
Bar's yours, brother's yours!

499
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,279
Gullu, let's go from here.
- Hey, please wait.

500
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,720
One more!

501
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,080
Gullu, I'm leaving okay!

502
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,520
Please wait, we'll go.

503
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,359
I'm going.

504
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Hey, wait.

505
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,800
Did you see him?

506
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,080
Whom?

507
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,600
Who else, your rabbit!

508
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,360
He was awestruck
to see me here!

509
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,319
My dear, this truth
is really harsh.

510
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,440
Great masters can't take it
what to say about this lad!

511
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,839
Let it be.

512
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
Come on, shut it down right away.
- Yes.

513
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,920
Quick, shut down.

514
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,520
If Tawde sir gets angry everything
will turn into a mess.

515
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,200
Check the time! - Yes.
- It's 1.30 am.

516
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,040
Shut down right away. - Yes
sir, 2 minutes we're doing it.

517
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,960
Don't you understand! you think
I'm crazy? know the seriousness!

518
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,880
Come on, shut it quickly.

519
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,000
You'll, make it quick,
cops are creating a havoc outside.

520
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Come on, quick!
Come on.

521
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,920
Barkhaa.

522
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,040
What?

523
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,120
You felt bad, right?
that your rabbit saw you here.

524
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,760
I don't feel anything now.

525
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,200
Let's go to the airport.

526
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,640
Jatin...

527
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,879
Please, forget her!

528
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,640
These bar girls belong to no one.

529
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,720
One who goes after them
gets completely destroyed.

530
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,200
Look, stay away from all this.

531
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,240
Brother, why so less girls today?

532
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,600
It's risky to keep girls on the floor today.

533
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,680
Media and tipper of police have
created a lot of tension!

534
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,960
We have to keep catering to
the extortion!

535
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,960
Regardless your business
flourishes or goes in a dump.

536
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,240
It's less for them, may how
big the amount is.

537
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,200
So, this is the reason other
girls are out in the car.

538
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,120
As soon the particular
female's guest is here,

539
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
we'll get one out
from here and her inside.

540
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,080
You continue to drink,
the one you like is coming in.

541
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,400
What are you doing here?

542
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,880
What are you up to?

543
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,480
Come on, get up.
Get up!

544
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,800
Come here, I'd asked you to
stay away from her, right?

545
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,360
Do you have any clue about
what are you doing!

546
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,240
You're heading towards the hell!

547
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,920
Your present, future everything
will be at a stake because of her.

548
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,720
Think about your self esteem, think
about your father's reputation.

549
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,160
Think of something!

550
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,280
These bar girls keep guys
like you on their finger tips!

551
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,600
Did you get it?

552
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,280
It isn't any kind of love!
It's just her mere body attracting you.

553
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,279
Why don't you understand?

554
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,680
The path you're heading to will
destroy you and nothing else.

555
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,360
I can understand this simple
thing then why don't you?

556
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,480
Jatin!

557
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Vinita, where's Jatin?
- Upstairs in his room.

558
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,800
Jatin

559
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,040
Good morning dad.

560
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,280
I heard you arrived home
late in the night, even yesterday.

561
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,160
And that you stay at the office
flat most of the time.

562
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,600
Son, is everything okay?

563
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,160
Yes dad.

564
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,600
Okay, see you at the office
in the afternoon.

565
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,120
Hey, how long will you take?
get it quickly.

566
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,400
Mr. Mehta, this song is dedicated to you!

567
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,080
The one who is sitting there,
tell him Barkhaa has called him.

568
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,880
You've been called.
- What?

569
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,920
Barkhaa has called you in.

570
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Why?
- I don't know.

571
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,760
Please come in.

572
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh my my!

573
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,000
Come here, sit.

574
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,440
What?

575
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,200
I'm observing this since many days!

576
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,240
You come here, sit in a corner and order a drink,

577
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,400
keeps staring at me, gathers the collection,

578
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
and then you pay the bill
without drinking and leave.

579
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,800
Why?

580
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,680
You should come ahead and sit!

581
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,120
When you spend so much,
enjoy the worth it! right?

582
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,440
What's your name?

583
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,720
Jatin.

584
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,760
What do you do? I mean
your what's source of income?

585
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,360
I'm studying law.

586
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,960
What's law?

587
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,000
Advocacy!

588
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,920
That's nice, you're an advocate?

589
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,920
Not yet an advocate.

590
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,359
When you're studying advocacy
definitely you'll be an advocate soon!

591
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,920
Look, I asked you to come
here to tell you that

592
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,680
you shouldn't be cornered
like a thief, you must sit ahead.

593
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,080
You and me;
both of us happy, right?

594
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,640
Why?

595
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,960
What you mean by why?

596
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,879
It's my wish, I'll sit anywhere I want to.

597
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,320
What difference does it make to you?

598
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,879
It does make a difference.

599
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:17,680
Everyone here knows, you're
crazy for me and come here to see me.

600
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,880
So then, you shouldn't sit
crouched in a corner like a rabbit.

601
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,160
She has named you, Rabbit!

602
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,640
Hey...

603
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,520
Listen...

604
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,720
Why did you make fun of him?

605
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,640
Anyone who comes here, eventually
creates a mockery of himself!

606
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,720
Look, I think he really loves you Barkhaa.

607
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,760
My dear, a man just wants one thing!

608
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,200
May he begins anyhow,
he reaches to the same thing.

609
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,640
A woman sleeps with a man for love and
a man loves a woman to sleep with her!

610
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,200
It's nothing like this.

611
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,680
Barkhaa, even I've experienced things in life

612
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,160
I can read the real emotions in eyes.

613
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,880
Didn't you see

614
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,360
the way he was looking at you,
with full of love in his eyes.

615
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,760
Now, it makes no sense whether
he looks with love or lust!

616
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't care and I'm just
concerned with my need

617
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,200
and that is money!

618
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,520
Money is everything now!

619
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,360
Everything else is worthless!

620
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,280
Get up, let's go on the floor.

621
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,680
Namaste brother.

622
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,720
Hey, Mr. Perfect, Namaste.

623
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,960
How are you?
- I'm doing great.

624
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,120
Brother, I need to talk to you.

625
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,400
Sure, please have a seat.

626
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,360
Tell me.

627
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,720
Brother, my friend Jatin, he
has fallen for a girl here.

628
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,200
Barkhaa!

629
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,440
Brother if you don't mind,

630
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,240
With my friend, will she be ready to...

631
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,400
one night Barkhaa would??

632
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,120
I hope you understand me?

633
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,240
With her will and wish! only if she wants to.

634
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,000
There's no force.

635
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,000
And, money is not an issue!

636
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,920
You and your friend helped me.

637
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,600
Without charging any fee.

638
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,960
With complete generosity.

639
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,880
That's why even I totally respected it.

640
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,880
Same here brother!

641
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,720
But now, listen to me.

642
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,400
Listen to me carefully and understand.

643
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,600
Yes.

644
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,560
Firstly, I run a bar and not bawdy house.

645
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,880
Brother, I didn't mean this.

646
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:33,480
Secondly, I know what image bar
dancers have out in people's view.

647
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,240
Everybody thinks any and every girl
who's a bar dancer is a whore!

648
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,680
Is ready sell off herself and
can sleep with anyone for money!

649
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,680
But that's not the way it is.

650
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,240
Helplessness makes one do many
things, depends on good and bad times.

651
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,400
They're definitely in this market
but definitely not a pick up girl!

652
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:05,320
And, as much I know Barkhaa she
would never do this, never sell herself!

653
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,960
To be honest, if anyone else
might have said this

654
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,480
he wouldn't have moved out
from here on his feet.

655
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,240
Actually I...

656
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,000
Thank you.
- Okay.

657
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,960
This is nice, god knows when
will my lover will turn up!

658
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,200
Hema, Reena, Kavita, don't
you'll want to go on the floor?

659
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:40,720
Hey hero, when will you send me?
That oldie is waiting for me out!

660
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,720
If anything happens to him there
the loss would be mine, no money!

661
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,240
Anyways there's a great risk!

662
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,320
Those cops can come down anytime in
these 2 hours and stop everything!

663
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,160
Varsha, why do you take
so much of tension?

664
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,640
Brother has full setting
with these cops.

665
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,400
You'll be safe, I can guarantee you.

666
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,120
How? setting was there earlier also, right!

667
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,280
Yes, it was there.

668
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,960
Don't you remember about the raid
in the previous month?

669
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,440
This Hema, Reena, Hirni all were
in the jail for a week.

670
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,560
Yes, but it was brother who
got them out on bail.

671
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,640
This happens at times.

672
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,640
Anyways, I'll call you in sometime.

673
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,400
You'll make it quick, go out.

674
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,360
Barkhaa...
- Yes.

675
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,560
Your rabbit turned
out to be very cunning!

676
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,600
Why? what happened?

677
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That fatso, who used to accompany him

678
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,840
he was trying to do some setting with brother

679
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,320
to make you spend a night with that rabbit.

680
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,880
Hey what happened?

681
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,240
Sir, I don't know what happened.

682
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,280
What are you playing!
play my song.

683
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,760
Yes sir, I'll play it.

684
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,680
How much can you pay?

685
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,600
What?

686
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,400
How much can you pay me
for sleeping with me?

687
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,319
I didn't get you.

688
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,760
Why?

689
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,960
What happened?

690
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,240
This is what you wanted.

691
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,799
This is why yo were doing all this.

692
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,000
This is why you were
pretending things since many days!

693
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Now what happened? speak up.
Why don't you say anything now!

694
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,160
Who told you that I...

695
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,240
Hey! don't try to pretend
things after me.

696
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,080
Trying to act innocent.

697
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,920
Who sent that fatso to talk to brother?

698
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,480
To finalize the rate for me
to spend a night with you.

699
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,240
You should have come directly.

700
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,720
Should have directly told me that
you want to sleep with me!

701
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,520
You have no courage.

702
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,560
No one's different!
Everyone has this one intention.

703
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,960
What did you think?

704
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,840
I dance here this means I'm a whore!

705
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,200
I sweat blood over every step spending 2
hours and more dancing on the floor.

706
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,000
Every time the money is thrown
at time, my respect is thrown down too.

707
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,640
Everyday I'm being raped
by these dirty hungry eyes!

708
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,280
It's then that I earn money.

709
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,760
My bread and butter comes with
my hard earned money.

710
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,320
Did you get that?

711
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,880
Get up, get up!

712
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,760
Hey!

713
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:36,839
Hey...

714
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,720
Who asked you?

715
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,560
Who asked you?
- Why are you hitting me?

716
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,080
Who asked you to go to brother
and talk this cheap thing?

717
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,680
Look, I thought...
- What did you think?

718
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:56,680
Hey, I thought if you get her once
you will get rid off the craze of love.

719
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
Moreover, I also tried to
make you understand.

720
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,800
Don't make me understand,
just don't!

721
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,080
You understand;
you understand it very well.

722
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,920
I love her.

723
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,560
I love her a lot!

724
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,320
Why can't you get this simple thing in your mind!

725
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,120
How should I make you understand?

726
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,960
What should I do?

727
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,960
Neither she is ready to
understand nor you!

728
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,360
Don't complicate my problems.

729
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
Stay away from me.
- But Jatin...

730
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,800
Leave me lone.

731
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,760
Actually, I'd called up brother

732
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,040
and he told me you're here.

733
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,960
In fact, it's good.

734
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,840
As, what I want to say there
won't be any better place than this.

735
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,840
Barkhaa, the thing about
spending a night with you

736
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,000
Jatin has no fault in it,
it's my mistake.

737
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,360
Why are you telling
me all this?

738
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,800
So that you shouldn't
misunderstand Jatin in any ways.

739
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,200
What's the need of me to understand him?

740
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,040
It's said no one goes
disheartened from here!

741
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,320
He keeps talking to your photos all day long.

742
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,360
Those talks which he actually cannot
converse with you.

743
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,640
He's in nostalgia with your memories
crying and craving you the whole day

744
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,440
and keeps waiting to
see a glimpse of you at night!

745
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,360
Wait for a minute.

746
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,440
Do you recognize this?

747
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,080
This is your handkerchief.

748
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,560
This fell down while you were
getting in the bus in Himachal.

749
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,920
And this, even this is yours.

750
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,800
He has kept it with such a care as if

751
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,760
anyone takes care of valuable belongings.

752
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:08,840
Barkhaa, it really doesn't matter to
him who you are, your background,

753
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,760
Barkhaa, he loves you a lot.

754
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,880
I want to meet Jatin, right now.

755
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,560
Uh, Jatin
- Dad, just a second.

756
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,640
Hello, hold for a second.

757
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,520
Yes dad.

758
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,760
Son, you reach office and I'll come
after visiting Commissioner’s office.

759
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,440
Okay dad.
- Okay? - Yes.

760
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,960
Yes, tell me.
- I'm trying to call you since long!

761
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,600
Look, I've cleared the mess and
now there's no problem.

762
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,400
Now, what did you Gullu?

763
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,760
Leave all that, listen to me carefully.
Barkhaa wants to meet you.

764
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:59,040
Sometimes even the truth to fight
to prove it's existence.

765
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,160
As Jatin's truth had to fight!

766
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:08,759
Today, there was a truth that no
one could deny, not even me.

767
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,280
Jatin's truth, his truth of the true love for me.

768
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,480
And now, it was time to know
other side of the coin! my truth.

769
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,720
And, I'd now decided to
tell him the same.

770
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,000
Hey sweetheart!

771
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,960
You'll make your darling lose
today if this keeps happening.

772
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,559
Some other girl will
become a bar queen!

773
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,600
Your darling will be
insulted before everyone!

774
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,160
Bar queen means?

775
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,920
It's Happy new year today!
- So?

776
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,640
So, the girl who is showered
with most money today

777
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,200
everyone considers her as a bar queen.

778
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:12,960
But, until there's my king here,
no other girl can be the bar queen.

779
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,080
Yes, of course! It's you
who will be the bar queen.

780
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,480
Really!
- I'm there, why do you worry.

781
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,640
Sajan, go and call the manager.

782
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,440
Tell him Sawant sir has called him.

783
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,040
Today, I'll shower my darling
with so much of money

784
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,679
that the complete floor will burst.

785
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,960
Tomorrow, I want to say something to you.

786
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,519
Something special!
- What?

787
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,040
Not today, tomorrow.

788
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,360
Dear, your philanderer was just amazing.

789
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,840
He made you the queen for this year.

790
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,680
And the one after me, frog!

791
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,920
Just kept giving me the jazz,
such a jerk.

792
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,000
Hello.
- Dear Barkhaa.

793
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,440
Aunty! how are you?
- Dear, I needed some money.

794
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,160
Aunty, I'll send the money.
Get everything you require.

795
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,759
Also, Gopal was saying
he wants a bike! - Yes.

796
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,640
Ask him to buy it immediately tomorrow.

797
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,960
Who else is there for me apart from you!

798
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:25,960
My sweet daughter.

799
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,200
Why do you worry,

800
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,639
this time lord laxmi has
showered all her blessings on me.

801
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,640
Yes Aunty.

802
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,440
Give me some water.

803
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,080
Brother, Kavita had called and
told me she won't come today

804
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:08,880
Says, she is going for dinner with her
biker guy, the one with candles.

805
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,400
But not just her, other girls too
are doing the something similar.

806
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,759
They've earned fat on the new year night!

807
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,800
So, they're spending.

808
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,760
Make understand these stupid girls

809
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,280
to save up the money or else
they'll have to start begging.

810
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,200
Look at this, court's final notice.

811
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,000
Within a week Mumbai's all
dance bars should be shut down.

812
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,440
What will they do later?
Where to go? What will they earn?

813
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,040
Thousands of families run
because of this business.

814
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,200
Within a moment all of them will be destroyed.

815
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,720
But no one cares!

816
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:59,000
But why brother? Bars are working
since years, nothing ever happened.

817
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,920
Then of a sudden what is this?

818
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,600
There's not one thing to tell you,
there are hell lot a things going on.

819
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,000
Dance bars are not sufficient to some people.

820
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:18,640
So, service bars, pick up point, every thing
is going on under the tag of dance bars.

821
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,639
And, minister Waghmare!

822
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,320
Some nephew of his,
fell for a bar girl.

823
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:36,840
That's it, minister's temper got high
and announced to shut all the dance bars.

824
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,680
He says, people come here and
get ruined and destroyed!

825
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,200
They sell off our their
homes and property.

826
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,759
Such a jerk.

827
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,080
Tell me something, one who
wants to sell off

828
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,040
he can also sell it off at
a gambling spot and for alcohol!

829
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,920
Yes, he will. - What's the need
to come here at a dance bar!

830
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,440
Yes, that's correct!

831
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,840
Aakash.

832
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,240
This Auto rickshaw driver,
he takes so long.

833
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,320
See, here's the king!

834
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,480
What's this uncle? you're late
again. - Sorry ma'am.

835
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,800
The only English word you've learnt
in your lifetime, you'd use with me.

836
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,400
Let's go.

837
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,800
Now what's wrong with her?
Barkhaa, let's go.

838
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,640
Aakash, where are we?

839
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,040
Take it easy dear.

840
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,920
I did not elope you, right?

841
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,160
And, some things are said and
done at their right place!

842
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:20,680
Come.

843
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,920
I couldn't say anything to you
as I was awaiting for this particular day.

844
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:22,320
I thought, I should say it you
at the right time and right place.

845
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,440
I love you Barkhaa.

846
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,560
Since the day I saw you for the first time.

847
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,440
Since that day I decided to
live my life with you.

848
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,000
I've created this small world for us.

849
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,440
Only we will be there and no one else.

850
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:59,440
This doesn't mean you
think the same for me as I do.

851
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,760
I love you and that's
sufficient for me.

852
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,040
I can't see you being treated as
an exhibition at the bar.

853
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,160
Barkhaa, I want to spent
my whole life with you.

854
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,960
Needs and requirements of the
family got me to Mumbai from Himachal.

855
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,640
I didn't get a job anywhere.

856
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,800
Wherever I approached,

857
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,080
just saw dirty eyes
trying to peep within my clothes!

858
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,240
Then, someone got me a job
at the dance bar.

859
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,639
I thought, when I've bear
those dirty eyes everywhere

860
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,200
so what's bad in this bar,

861
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,440
at least I'll be paid for this.

862
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,840
Like every other girl, even I had a dream

863
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,240
that someone will love me
more than myself!

864
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,960
May be you're the one
I was awaiting for.

865
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,400
I had a lot of complains with my destiny.

866
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:21,000
But, I had no idea that my
destiny will bless me like this.

867
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,520
I don't know Aakash
am I even worth it!

868
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,360
But I'll try my best to make
myself worth your love.

869
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:42,240
I'm thankful to you for giving me a
place in your heart and your dreams.

870
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,040
What! did you tell Aakash?

871
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,320
He's in Pune, as soon he comes
I'll tell him.

872
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,160
Which month is going on?

873
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,160
Third month.

874
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,760
Ask her is it a girl or a boy?

875
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,640
Hey, stupid! how will she know
is it a girl or a boy!

876
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,640
Baby isn't born with a voting card.

877
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,640
Mad!

878
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:44,680
I know that, I just meant what does
she wish, a boy or a girl?

879
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,120
Anyone, it's Barkhaa's right!

880
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,080
Is it Barkhaa's phone?

881
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,480
-Yes, brother.

882
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,360
Barkhaa, how are you?

883
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,120
Brother!

884
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,080
She will be happy, obviously.
She is going to be a mother.

885
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,599
That's true.

886
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,360
Brother, wish you a Happy birthday!

887
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,160
You remembered it's my birthday today.

888
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,360
How can I forget your birthday brother!

889
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,240
Also today it's dad's birthday.

890
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,800
I lost him in the childhood
but always saw him in you.

891
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,360
How can Barkhaa forget my dad's birthday.

892
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,880
Please take care.

893
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,240
Why didn't you tell us prior that
it's brother's birthday today.

894
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,440
Anyways, it's good for we all.

895
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,320
You'll be a mother and brother's
birthday, 1 on 1 free treat.

896
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,719
Party for all of us.
Yaay!

897
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,760
What are you saying!
- Yes and look, my new phone.

898
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,440
Show me.
- Uh!

899
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,360
You're stubborn, won't change.

900
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,280
I'd told you, you must take care
and stay home in this condition.

901
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,240
But, you'd recently purchased a phone, right?

902
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,920
Yes.
- Even this seems expensive.

903
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:54,920
You know how to use it?

904
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,640
Where do I even know to dance?

905
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,200
Still I manage, right?

906
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,599
I'll manage with this as well.

907
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,840
That uncle, clothes shop!

908
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:08,720
Tells me, Madhu your phone is too
busy now-a-days when contacted.

909
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,040
Take this, new number and
new phone.

910
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,120
I'll have big conversations
with you all night.

911
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,880
She is so notorious!

912
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,840
Madhu!

913
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,800
Come on, come on, come on!
It's birthday.

914
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,680
We'll cut brother's cake.

915
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,440
This wasn't needed.
- I'll get cold drinks for all.

916
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,840
You're like...

917
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,800
Stop, stop everything!

918
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,880
No one will move from their places!
Don't move, don't move.

919
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,519
Sit down where you're!
No one will move.

920
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,400
Take him aside,
take all of them aside.

921
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,040
Brother, brother it's police,
police...

922
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,160
Come on, leave.
- Barkhaa you leave.

923
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,040
Everyone move out, come on
quickly.

924
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,240
Quick, quick, move, quick!

925
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,560
Madhu!

926
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,280
Get up, let's go.

927
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,000
Run!

928
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,880
Hey, wait.

929
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,320
What I was saying is...

930
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,920
Sir.

931
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,440
- Sir, please leave her.

932
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,920
What?
- Sir, she doesn't belong with us.

933
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,000
She'd just come to meet us.

934
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,880
She doesn't belong to you all!

935
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,600
Since 5 years she's dancing here and
you say she's not from this bar.

936
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,480
You think I'm a jerk!

937
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,800
No sir, she was a dancer here
but not now, she has left this line.

938
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,360
Oh, is that so.

939
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,680
She got married and settled now.

940
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,400
She was here to just meet
us on my birthday.

941
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,160
Wow, brother, you didn't tell
us it's your birthday.

942
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,000
Instead of today, we would've
arranged the raid for tomorrow.

943
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,440
For no reason your birthday is ruined.

944
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,600
Let's go, we'll celebrate your birthday
at the police station.

945
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,240
Tawde, right?
- Yes sir, definitely.

946
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,440
He's like a family.

947
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,600
Listen, brother, cake from our side, alright.

948
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,520
Sir, I'll come, please leave her.

949
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,160
Brother, don't frustrate me, come on.

950
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:36,720
Tawde, close it.

951
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,760
Sir, please leave her, please!

952
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,000
Walk straight, go ahead.

953
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,400
What I was saying...

954
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,800
Shut up and move, come on.

955
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,640
Why did you come?

956
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,760
I've committed a mistake sir,
I won't repeat it.

957
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,519
Please let me go.

958
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,440
Hey!

959
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,040
Are you married?

960
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:22,880
I beg your pardon.

961
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,880
Are you married?

962
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,040
Yes sir, I am.

963
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,120
Wife at home
and you at the bar!

964
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,800
For what kind of
were you there for!

965
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,200
Sir, a married man has a miserable life.

966
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,599
What?
- Sir, I mean, I mean...

967
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:44,360
After marriage a man turns
into an ATM machine.

968
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:50,360
Here's comes the command
and here the withdrawal.

969
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,480
Sir, even I'm a human, right?

970
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,640
Last year I took her to Manali for
vacations, she said wants to go Goa!

971
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:58,680
When I took her to Goa,
she says let's go to Bhopal.

972
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,080
As soon I enter the house,
she starts whining!

973
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,920
I'm aware, a bar girl has
everything fake in her.

974
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:17,400
Her dance, smile, every little thing
but, the moment she comes close

975
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,400
and says, How are you?
It feels good!

976
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,880
Sir, should I leave?

977
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,880
You're trying to act too smart!

978
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,120
What about you?

979
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,760
You're too fed up with your wife's
whining that made you sit in a bar?

980
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,120
Sir, I'm not yet married.

981
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,200
So, why did you go there?

982
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,000
This is the reason I'd gone there.

983
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,400
My goodness.

984
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,000
Sir, shall we go now?

985
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,240
You're lucky that it
was me on the duty.

986
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,200
Get lost from here,
come on move.

987
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,080
Sir, I...

988
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,120
Sir...

989
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,040
Sir, let her go please.

990
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,840
Sir, you and me will take care
of everything else here, please.

991
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,000
Sir, your wish will be my command.

992
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,880
I'm running a bar since years, I never gave
any officer an opportunity to complain.

993
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,000
Sir, please let her go.
Everyone else is here.

994
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,120
No brother, I cannot do that.

995
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,320
Try to understand!

996
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:34,240
Look, you and Sawant sir had a good setting
so we just pretended to put the raid at your bar.

997
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,920
But, did we ever put in a big loss?

998
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,680
No, right?

999
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,440
Did we ever catch hold of
Anyone? No!

1000
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,680
Did we ever file a case against you?

1001
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,760
No! am I right?

1002
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,680
Brother, try to understand
the seriousness.

1003
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,160
This has big names
involved in doing this.

1004
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,240
Ministers are the culprit?

1005
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,520
Elections are on the verge.

1006
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,000
This drama is just to pull people's
attention and distract them.

1007
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,440
In real they're not interested to
do anything substantial for people.

1008
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,560
They just keep doing drama!

1009
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,960
And, you're aware about everything.

1010
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,600
Listen to me.

1011
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:15,840
They're using social service teams
as weapons against you and me.

1012
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,520
Brother, things are not in my control.

1013
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,560
I'm helpless.

1014
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:30,120
But, in spite of that I can leave
your staff somehow but, none girl!

1015
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,160
Sir...
- No!

1016
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:37,720
These morons have made a list
stating each girl's name in your bar.

1017
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,920
Even if a single girl is left Scot
free, my job is in trouble.

1018
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,480
Sir, there will be some way out!

1019
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,480
Sir, please do something.

1020
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:54,880
Just let her go and nothing else.
I'll be grateful to you all my life.

1021
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,600
I beg of you.

1022
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,080
So, you've left this work, right?

1023
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,000
Yes.

1024
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,400
How long it's been?
- 6 months.

1025
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,520
What do you do now?

1026
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,160
I just stay home now.

1027
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,440
Kept on salary basis?
- I'm his wife.

1028
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,600
Wife! So, finally you trapped someone!

1029
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,560
Very good!

1030
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,000
What does your husband do?

1031
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,440
Hey, I'm asking you!

1032
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,520
I don't know.

1033
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,680
It's your husband or your neighbor’s?

1034
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,280
I don't know what he does.

1035
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,960
Bhagve sir! - Yes.
- Did you listen to this?

1036
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,600
These people say that she's
innocent and got caught by fluke.

1037
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,400
But she doesn't even know
what's her husband's profession.

1038
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,720
Really!

1039
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,480
Everything's a drama.

1040
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:06,280
In real there's no husband so how
will she know it what does he do.

1041
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,920
I'm aware of these whores
very well!

1042
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:15,040
They pretend to be sober when caught
whereas they get sold off just like this!

1043
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,800
Sir, don't refer me a whore!

1044
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:17,920
What did you say?

1045
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,440
Don't refer me a whore!

1046
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,640
I was a bar dancer, I used to
dance and not do what a whore does.

1047
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,960
What's a difference between
a whore and a bar dancer?

1048
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,599
The same difference that's between
your wife and a housekeeping maid.

1049
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,400
One's in bed with you at night and other,
makes up the same bed in the morning.

1050
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,600
Both do their respective jobs
and do not behave as a whore.

1051
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,600
Hey you!

1052
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,920
This mere bar dancer has
guts to talk about my wife!

1053
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,840
Sir, even I'm someone's wife.

1054
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,240
He's a reputed man.

1055
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,240
If you would've said this in his
presence he would smash you here.

1056
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,559
If so, call him here right away.

1057
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,960
Ask him to come here
and talk to me.

1058
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:58,320
I won't spare you now and make
sure you're behind the bars all your life.

1059
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,880
Ma'am, dial the number.
- Tell me.

1060
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,680
His name is Aakash.

1061
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,640
Hello.
- Aakash?

1062
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,880
Yes, speaking, who is this?

1063
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,400
I'm head constable Anjali Lambole here.

1064
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,280
Okay, I'm listening.

1065
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,680
We had a raid at an orchestra bar.

1066
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,760
During which we caught hold
of some girls dancing

1067
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:34,800
and in compromising condition and
out of which there's a girl...

1068
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,280
Her name is...

1069
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,080
Hey, what's your name?

1070
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,360
Barkhaa.

1071
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,560
Barkhaa!

1072
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,240
Barkhaa!

1073
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,440
You will have to visit the
police station for her identification.

1074
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,880
No, I don't know any girl with this name.

1075
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,120
What are you saying!

1076
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,600
You're her husband, right?

1077
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,400
Husband! what nonsense.

1078
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,720
Nonsense!
But she says you're her husband.

1079
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,360
I'm still single.
- Single!

1080
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,880
What are you saying?

1081
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,520
I don't know even a normal
girl with the name Barkhaa.

1082
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,040
And moreover she is a bar girl.

1083
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,160
I'm sure it's just some
big misunderstanding!

1084
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,759
But what says is this.

1085
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,240
Ma'am, let her say what
she wants to!

1086
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,400
But she is repeating the same thing.

1087
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,600
That doesn't make a difference.

1088
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,840
I just don't know this girl.

1089
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,600
Yes, this girl,
what did you tell me her name?

1090
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,600
Barkhaa.

1091
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,680
Barkhaa must have got my number
from somewhere and now

1092
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,880
she is misusing it to get Scot-free.

1093
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,040
Hey!

1094
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,040
What did you say?
You don't know Barkhaa!

1095
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:43,719
Now, who is this?

1096
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,720
Your mother, you jerk!

1097
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,040
Who was the one, who used to sit
at the bar for hours staring at her.

1098
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,759
Also, the one who showed her
dreams about marriage

1099
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,040
and took her to the flat and had fun!

1100
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:57,360
Kept her like a wife.

1101
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,400
Now, when it's time come
forward to face the world

1102
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,640
you're backing off!

1103
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,360
I never had trust on him!

1104
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,120
Now, I'm hanging up the phone.

1105
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,759
Just hang up and I'll show you jerk!

1106
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:14,400
I'll come there and smash
your body and shred you into pieces!

1107
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,560
It's known well, to fool around
there's none best than a dumb bar girl!

1108
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,400
It's our mistake, we see dreams!

1109
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,760
of a home,

1110
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,280
of a happy married life,

1111
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,160
of a husband,

1112
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,520
of having the bread with respect!

1113
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,080
Make promises,

1114
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:41,920
give assurances of making our
dreams come true and fulfill your intentions.

1115
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,520
This what you did with Barkhaa!

1116
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,440
Also, this fool thought her
fate has shined forever!

1117
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:58,080
Fate of we bar girls just shines
from 11 to 2 in the night!

1118
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,640
If she might have used her brains
instead of getting emotional

1119
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,480
she would've been away
from a rascal like you!

1120
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,800
She wouldn't have given up
everything for you!

1121
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
She wouldn't have been pregnant
with your child in her womb!

1122
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,440
She has conceived!

1123
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,200
It's been 2 months by now.

1124
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,800
If you still have some shame
and humanity left within you

1125
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,960
then come and stand by her.

1126
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,440
I don't know any lady with
this name, is that clear!

1127
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,000
Muma!

1128
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,800
Muma, have a look at this.

1129
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,920
Take me closer.

1130
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,000
Barkhaa, It doesn't matter
what's your past.

1131
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,600
But it does matter how
your future should be!

1132
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,640
Now, the decision is up to you.

1133
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,320
And, if talking about me

1134
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:32,320
I'm an incurable disease you can
get rid off only by losing your life!

1135
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,480
Happy birthday to you!

1136
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:27,040
Happy birthday dear.

1137
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,440
Happy birthday to you!

1138
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,320
Happy birthday...

1139
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,680
Many happy returns of the day son.

1140
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,680
God bless you my son.
- Thanks dad!

1141
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,840
I was about to come home to meet you all.

1142
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:42,920
Really! Liar.

1143
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,360
Barkhaa.

1144
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,680
Raju!

1145
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,719
Take her to the guest room.

1146
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,040
Yes.

1147
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,560
Please come.

1148
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,480
Uncle, it's too late so
I should leave.

1149
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,480
Good night.

1150
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,960
Jatin, my son...

1151
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,800
It's not the only question about
Sabbarwal family's reputation.

1152
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,160
It's about you son.

1153
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,000
Your life, your future!

1154
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,040
What people will say
about this is a later part.

1155
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:10,440
But the point is, how will you
sustain this relationship?

1156
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,640
Jatin, she is a mother of 1.

1157
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:21,000
Also, look at her profession,
where she belongs to, her background.

1158
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,320
No Jatin, this isn't love but your foolishness.

1159
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,600
Practically it's not worth!

1160
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,040
Why don't you understand?

1161
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,800
I understand mom,
I completely understand.

1162
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,840
I thought you both will understand
at least, dad will understand.

1163
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,280
No problem!

1164
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,840
I can understand this is
so difficult for you both.

1165
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,800
But muma, please tell me

1166
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,280
What should I do?

1167
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,920
I love her, a lot!

1168
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,760
I cannot live without her.

1169
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,599
But I love you both a lot too.

1170
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,560
And dad, may be I'll agree if
you deny to this.

1171
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,880
But dad, what should I do of these breaths?

1172
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,080
those will completely stop without Barkhaa.

1173
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,880
Jatin, you are emotionally black mailing us.

1174
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,080
You...
- Vinita, one minute.

1175
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,120
Look, listen to what he's saying,
he's gone crazy!

1176
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,040
Vinita please!

1177
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:44,080
Son, if you think what you're
doing is right, then okay.

1178
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,200
But there's one condition!

1179
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:51,800
No one in India should come
to know about this.

1180
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:58,120
I will settle you both at Fiji.

1181
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,360
Is that okay?

1182
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,440
Thank you dad.

1183
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,280
Mom!

1184
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,160
Thanks dad.

1185
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,800
What did you say this!

1186
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,320
How can you do this?

1187
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,640
Vinita consider this as a stupidity
or a foolishness of his age!

1188
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,400
At this point of time we cannot
make him understand.

1189
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:28,680
He won't be convinced.

1190
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,600
Now there's only one who
can make him understand.

1191
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,320
Listen to me, luggage is here.

1192
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,560
Son, please come soon.

1193
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,200
Dad, I've just landed.

1194
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,920
Don't worry dad, now that I'm
here I'll take care of it.

1195
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,720
Waiting for you.
- See you in a while, bye.

1196
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,480
Shall we go?
-Yes.

1197
01:49:58,680 --> 01:49:59,680
Come on, let's go.

1198
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,880
Come on kids.

1199
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:32,960
Hello. - Dibakar, I want
all the details of writer Panchi.

1200
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:38,440
I repeat, complete details.
Nothing should be left.

1201
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,680
Yes ma'am, I'm trying my best.

1202
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,720
Hey, Sir is here!

1203
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,520
Ma'am, sir!

1204
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,240
Brother! Hello
- Hello.

1205
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,200
Namaste mother-in-law.
- God bless you dear.

1206
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,160
How are you my little brother?

1207
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,320
I'm fine! come let's go.

1208
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,520
Brother, you've gained weight!

1209
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:21,440
Look dear, this is a sign
of a happy family.

1210
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,760
Mom dad got us married
and now we're enjoying!

1211
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,960
Oh sister-in-law!

1212
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,480
Brother, have a look she loves
me so much! same, same color

1213
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,760
Oh that's great.

1214
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,280
Where's dad?

1215
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,840
He's waiting for you inside.

1216
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,160
Okay, let's go.
- I'll get kids.

1217
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:37,680
Sure!

1218
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,360
Kids, come on.

1219
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,679
Come my kids.

1220
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,240
How was your trip?
- It was great.

1221
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,800
Where's dad?
- Dad, dad!

1222
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,400
My dear son, Aakash!
- Oh dad.

1223
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,000
How are you son?
- Good dad.

1224
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,480
Dad, bless me
- God bless you dear.

1225
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,720
Freshen up, we'll talk later.

1226
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,800
No, not at all mom, I'll get fresh later.

1227
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,800
First I would like to meet the girl who
made my brother spell bound for her.

1228
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,560
Dad didn't even tell me what's her name.

1229
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,680
No problem, I'll ask her by myself.
-Let's go.

1230
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,320
Boy, you've grown up!

1231
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,440
I'm very happy for you.

1232
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:16,720
Come.

1233
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,200
Where is she?

1234
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,680
Brother, she was here but now
may be in mom's room.

1235
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,400
Okay.

1236
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,800
I'll just go check
- Okay.

1237
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,360
I don't know even a normal
girl with the name Barkhaa.

1238
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,080
And moreover she is a bar girl.

1239
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,000
A, B, C, D...

1240
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,960
Neha, get up,
Neha, take the kids.

1241
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,560
Raju, keep the luggage in the car.

1242
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,640
Dad, I'm sorry I have to go.
I have to leave.

1243
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,840
I'm sorry Dad, I have to leave.

1244
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,880
Aakash, what happened?
- Aakash!

1245
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,400
What has happened Aakash? You'd just
arrived and you're leaving.

1246
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:20,000
Aakash, son, wait for a while,
what has happened dear?

1247
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,960
Dad I'm really sorry! He is a very
important client.

1248
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,920
It's necessary for me to go.
I have to go.

1249
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,480
Driver, get the car, quick!

1250
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,560
Aakash what are you doing,
how could you just leave like this?

1251
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:29,480
Try to understand mom.

1252
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,040
If it wasn't important would
I've left like this!

1253
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,640
I'll be back soon, getting late for the flight.

1254
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:34,120
I'll call you,
I'll call you dad.

1255
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,480
Come on, sit in the car.

1256
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,519
Dad, what happened?

1257
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,440
Don't know son, he's leaving.

1258
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,360
Let's go.

1259
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,400
Mom, what happened? - I don't know
anything what's happening.

1260
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:00,720
Our family album.

1261
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,920
Jatin.
- I'm coming mom.

1262
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,080
I don't know any lady with
this name, is that clear!

1263
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,480
That day, I just didn't lose Jatin,

1264
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:35,120
but I lost every hope, dream and
realization in life.

1265
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,200
What I would've said to Jatin?

1266
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,880
What would I've told him?

1267
01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:43,200
My one truth could have destroyed
many lives at a time.

1268
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,560
I could not do this.

1269
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:52,120
Rather than destroying many lives, it was
better that I would go away from them.

1270
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,160
And, that's what I did.

1271
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,960
That I was all broken inside and shattered.

1272
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,080
Life just seemed worthless and I
wished to die and may be

1273
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:06,800
I would actually do that, if I haven't
sensed about the innocent life.

1274
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,520
Where did she vanish?

1275
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:53,759
Dad I committed this mistake
unknowingly, I'm really very sorry

1276
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,960
Aakash!

1277
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,840
Exactly, what was my mistake?

1278
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:27,560
Believing a person like Aakash?

1279
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:31,360
or accepting Jatin's true love?

1280
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:35,120
I think that connecting line
between me and god has cut off

1281
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,160
where he listens to everyone.

1282
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,120
My voice could never reach him!

1283
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,440
Or may be he decided to have this
as the end of my story.

1284
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,720
Today, when I turn around to the past
everything seems blurred to me.

1285
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,880
Time has faded all faces to me,
they seem as strangers now.

1286
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,960
But that face; that one face is brightened
and clear even today.

1287
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:04,760
Within his eyes I'd witnessed true love.

1288
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,200
My rabbit's face.

1289
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,280
I know this story incomplete

1290
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:14,040
and may be some stories are considered
complete by their incompleteness.

1291
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:16,560
Everything around cannot always be complete.

1292
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:20,320
Also, complete is sometimes left incomplete.

1293
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:37,520
Come in.

1294
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:41,400
Ma'am these are the details.

1295
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,160
Thank you.

1296
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,720
This is a very rare case.

1297
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:32,760
I imagine what shock he was suffering
that his paralysis couldn't be cured.

1298
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,880
And now, this severe heart attack!
I'm sorry.

1299
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:53,040
Jatin, Barkhaa's address is found!

1300
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,000
I'm...
I'm sorry.

1301
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:21,800
There's a small village in Himachal,
Ratanpura.

1302
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,480
Bungalow no. 10

1303
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,960
This address is been found about Barkhaa.

1304
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:31,720
Strange thing is, 'AKS' has been shared with
our publication by Madhu and not Barkhaa.

1305
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,920
When Dibakar spoke to Madhu he
learnt that she wished,

1306
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,920
that world should know about Barkhaa's story.

1307
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,440
But Barkhaa never wished to do this.

1308
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,440
However according to Madhu,

1309
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:47,960
Even if Barkhaa's truth is revealed
it makes no difference.

1310
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:53,600
As, her story is left incomplete forever.

1311
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,240
This means, Barkhaa is no mo...
- Gullu shut up!

1312
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:58,679
You keep speaking nonsense.

1313
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:36,760
Barkhaa!

1314
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,320
This puja is being conducted for
offering condolences to Vimla Devi.

1315
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:41,960
Muma!

1316
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,759
You should have told me at least once!

1317
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:32,559
No family's reputation can be bigger
than a woman's self esteem!

1318
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:42,240
And I had told you

1319
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:48,760
I'm an incurable disease you can
get rid off only by losing your life!
