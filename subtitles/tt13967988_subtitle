1
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,250
'This is a beautiful world'

2
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:21,167
'But some inhumane beings do exist'

3
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,250
'Their desires are unquenchable'

4
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:26,917
'They are too greedy'

5
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,958
'Because we are living
in a fast-moving world'

6
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,625
'We want everything in a jiffy'

7
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,750
'None is patient enough'

8
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,083
'I was born with many
desires like everyone'

9
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,917
'I too have some desires and needs'

10
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,667
'No one understood this'

11
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:52,542
"Many people want to
live a contented life'

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,542
'But before we realize that
desires are not the reality... '

13
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,000
'our lives reach an end point'

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
'Some get an opportunity
to realize it sooner'

15
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,750
'Like I had such a day of realization'

16
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,542
'Our life is not just about us...

17
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:14,958
'It's how our fellow beings
let us live our lives'

18
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,500
'I realized it on... '

19
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,292
'23rd of July 2019'

20
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,292
If not for this day...

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,250
maybe I would have born in this
world like any other normal person

22
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,417
The nature knows the truth

23
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,875
Keep moving...

24
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:47,125
Hey, pull over

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,125
Move...

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,417
- What's inside?
- It's empty

27
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,375
- Finish the formalities and leave
- I don't have money

28
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,208
You are blocking the road

29
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,125
- Give the money and leave
- Go to hell

30
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,500
Move...

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,167
Check it

32
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,625
Go, stop the vehicle

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,292
Hey stop it...

34
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,333
Follow the truck

35
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,875
What's inside the truck?

36
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,708
- Get down
- I've no clue...

37
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,625
- better ask him
- What's he saying?

38
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,292
Look what's inside

39
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,375
I agree it's soiled currency

40
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,542
But why chase me down for it?

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Check it

42
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a corpse

43
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,125
Those heartless men have minced it

44
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,208
How did it end up here?

45
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,667
Who did it? Tell me

46
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,333
I swear it

47
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:27,208
It was empty when I picked the truck

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
Where did you pick it from?

49
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,208
From Vanagaram godown in Chennai

50
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
I unloaded it completely...

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,167
and I locked it myself

52
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm pretty sure that it was empty

53
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,875
At what time did you pick it?

54
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,042
Around 8 to 8.30

55
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,500
Did you stop the truck en route?

56
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,333
En-route to the
destination... near Tada...

57
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,000
I stopped the vehicle to take a leak

58
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,833
I think someone should
have done it erstwhile

59
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,125
You need not be so creative

60
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,125
I know my job

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,167
- Where are you from?
- Tikamgarh...

62
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,542
in Madhya Pradesh. But I'm innocent, sir

63
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,958
What are you blabbering?

64
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,083
Sit down

65
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,000
You heard me

66
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,417
Call Chennai Control Room

67
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,333
and inform them about this corpse

68
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:26,375
Update everything what
we know about this case

69
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:29,250
to the Chennai cops

70
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:34,083
Also, we shall pass the same
to our commissioner and proceed

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,917
He will inform the forensic
departments complying with the protocols

72
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,042
Before 16 hours...

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,958
Dear...

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,458
Get up, dear

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,125
Let me sleep for sometime

76
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,542
It's 5.45 AM

77
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,958
I insisted that you sleep early

78
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,292
You practiced 'Kolam' late night...

79
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,333
and now you are sleeping

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,208
'My name is Nandhini'

81
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,625
'My dad's name is Govindan'

82
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,083
'working as Government bus driver'

83
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
'My mom's name is Bhagyalakshmi... '

84
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,500
'she is a homemaker and my darling'

85
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,542
'Thanjavur is my native'

86
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,167
'We moved to Chennai as
my dad got transferred'

87
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,625
I did say that I will
take care of 'kolam'

88
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,833
Why are you doing it?

89
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,375
You were sleeping...

90
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,583
The porch was undecorated...

91
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,375
I have a lot of chores to take care of

92
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,458
Are you copying my designs?

93
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,458
So what?

94
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,083
Go fetch me coloured powders

95
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,750
I wanted to draw...

96
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:05,417
but I was running short of colors

97
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,167
"Sometimes... "

98
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,417
"Sometimes... in my heart"

99
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,833
I chose a simple design as
it's not a festive season

100
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:23,333
So that's why you hid the colors?

101
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,208
You have no sense

102
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,500
I will avenge you later

103
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,792
Ignore her and have this tea

104
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,208
You are 23 years old

105
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,042
You need me to remind you to
brush your teeth before having tea?

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,208
Hold on, dear. What do you mean?

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
What if she drinks without brushing?

108
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,917
Nothing... honey oblige your mother

109
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,208
Go brush your teeth

110
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,750
Go, dear

111
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,833
- It's my mistake to trust you
- Honey...

112
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,208
- Listen...
- Go

113
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,625
Oh God!

114
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,875
At least you have this
tea... "Sometimes... "

115
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,125
It's horoscope time

116
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,792
Horoscope for my sign
is yet to be announced

117
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,208
'Today's horoscope... '

118
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,292
'Oh God'

119
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,125
- It's getting late
- Ok, mom

120
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,458
Go and dry your clothes

121
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,708
I'm going, mom

122
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,958
India won the cup

123
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:20,375
'There is no permanent
problem in the world'

124
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,208
- 'Just quit it and free yourself'
- 'Okay, dad'

125
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,458
The marriage broker was talking
about a marriage prospect

126
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,750
Let me call him

127
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,333
'Virgo's time to let go your problems'

128
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,625
You watch only news
channels, nothing else

129
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,208
Why begin the day
with rapes and murders?

130
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,875
Give that to me

131
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,083
You eat first

132
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,208
Then you will keep shouting
when the cab arrives

133
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:00,625
Gone!

134
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,667
'He looks at her girl... '

135
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,792
Take this

136
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,375
- Fetch me some water
- Okay

137
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,083
- Attend my phone
- Will do

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,958
It's Nivedha

139
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,917
She is calling? She must be nearing

140
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,083
- Bring the phone
- Yeah, coming

141
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,125
- There you go
- Thanks, dad

142
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,333
- Hello
- Tell me

143
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,208
The cab will reach soon

144
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,917
- Aren't you ready?
- Long back

145
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,083
- Really?
- Hang the call

146
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,667
- Eat one more
- No, mom

147
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:36,875
Time up

148
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,667
- Hey Nandhini
- What's she doing?

149
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,292
What are you doing? Hurry up

150
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,458
I'm coming mom

151
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,583
ID card

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,417
- The cab is here
- Did you take your ID?

153
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,667
- I have
- Look..

154
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,250
Be careful... don't get into trouble

155
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,375
- Very importantly, put a check on your anger
- Ok darling

156
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,792
- Bye
- Be careful

157
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,625
The cab needs to wait for the princess?

158
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,458
Getting ready for the office early
in the morning is an irksome task

159
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,667
My morning begins with a chaos

160
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,792
My house is naturally chaotic

161
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,333
Sometimes I wonder
why is my life so hard?

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
Why are you so worried?

163
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,417
Everyone needs a dose of hardships

164
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,375
Some people go to office
by public transport

165
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,708
but our office has
provided us cab service

166
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,667
This is good

167
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,042
I want to share something with you

168
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,458
Try to understand

169
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:30,042
Only when we feel the
blaze of sunlight...

170
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,208
we run in search of the shadow

171
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,583
Hardships is like hot rays

172
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,750
it comes easy

173
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,458
But happiness is like a shadow

174
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,333
we need to look for it

175
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,458
It may be a shadow of a tree...

176
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:48,042
or it may be the shade
of a passing cloud...

177
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,458
or else...

178
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,542
it may be a shadow of
an advertisement umbrella

179
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,208
We need to find it

180
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,792
If there is no hardships in life...

181
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,667
we never know what happiness is

182
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,542
You need what first
infer what makes you happy

183
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,583
Tell me... I'm fine. How are you?

184
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,292
You are crossing the line

185
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:21,750
You are a stranger to me

186
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,125
We are just Facebook friends...

187
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,792
The day I realized that
you are so polluted...

188
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,917
I made my decision to avoid you

189
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:31,333
If you still stalk me...

190
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,417
I'll inform to my parents...

191
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,417
Also, I'll complain to
the police. Be careful

192
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,458
Owing to the monetary crisis,
with a reference from friend...

193
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,250
though this is completely
unrelated to my degree...

194
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,042
an internet based BPO

195
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,708
I was working here for two months
after completing the training

196
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,917
- Ok, bye
- What's the hurry?

197
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,333
You are on the third floor
but I am on the 5th floor

198
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,417
Hi

199
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,333
- How are you?
- Great

200
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,250
I want to ask you something

201
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,417
Are you sure that you need this job?

202
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,333
What about your kids?

203
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,500
One of my sons has completed his
engineering course and is at home

204
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,375
He doesn't want to join
any random job to earn...

205
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,958
He says that he is yet
to find the right job

206
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,292
Please recommend him for
an collector job if possible

207
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,000
I shall never forget your help

208
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:26,875
Whatever the reason... but
you working at this age...

209
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,083
Guess my age

210
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,500
- What's your age?
- Just 65

211
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,292
Please give a way for youngsters

212
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,958
I'm still young

213
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,792
You can crosscheck

214
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,833
I was a champion in bull
taming for three years

215
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,500
Is it so young man?

216
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,167
We shall meet in the evening

217
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,083
A call from Pathway Fibrenet...

218
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,625
This is Karthika...

219
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,208
Your internet is inactive
for the past 2 days...

220
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:04,542
May I know the reason?

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,417
I think you haven't yet
renewed your internet

222
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,708
May I know when will you do it?

223
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,542
This is Abirami from Pathway Fibrenet...

224
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,958
Your service is inactive...

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,667
May I know the reason?

226
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,250
I can't get you. Can you slow it?

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,708
Your connection is yet to be activated

228
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,292
Our customer care executive had
been calling you for the past 10 days

229
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,000
but you didn't give a proper response

230
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,333
Your account hasn't been renewed
yet... May I know the reason?

231
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,667
Your ID is yet to be renewed, sir

232
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,042
Serena from Pathway Fibrenet

233
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,458
This is Yashika from Pathway Fibrenet

234
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,333
You got a lot of new offers

235
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,542
Hold on, sir... let me check it for you

236
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,958
Tell me, dear. Okay? Bye

237
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,792
I have checked it for you

238
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,958
Who is this?

239
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,542
Hello sir. This is Sangeetha
from Pathway Fibrenet

240
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,958
- Is it Mr. Alagesan?
- Indeed, madam

241
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:56,750
Sir!

242
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,292
I can't believe it, sir

243
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,958
Your voice is so damn sweet

244
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,333
What?

245
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,750
There is a fabulous package which is
as good as you are. You want to hear it?

246
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,667
Yes, please

247
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,833
Actually...

248
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:21,875
Yes

249
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,750
It's a custom made package just for you

250
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,917
It's natural to name
him so when he was a kid

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,583
They should have changed
it after he grew up

252
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,250
Azhagesan?!

253
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,958
Wonder who baptized him

254
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,042
Bad start for the day

255
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,917
I failed today as well

256
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,042
There you go

257
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,833
But I will win it on someday

258
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,167
- Hi sister
- Hi

259
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,125
I'm checking the offers for you, sir

260
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,375
Yes, sir. I will do it

261
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,500
Please don't forget to renew, sir

262
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,958
Contact customer care
for further details

263
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,292
Again?

264
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,000
Our salary is just Rs. 15,000

265
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,292
Most of it goes for the penalty
of logging without swiping

266
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:53,500
and the rest for the charity?

267
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,583
You are so generous

268
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,667
Greetings, sir

269
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,958
This is Sangeetha calling
from Pathway Fibrenet

270
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,542
Regarding latest schemes...

271
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,917
Yes, Miss Nandhini Govindan?

272
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,042
I didn't call you

273
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,708
I heard that you are
technically too good...

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,375
but it doesn't reflect in your work

275
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,042
I hope you remember my words

276
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,750
I want you to call and renew

277
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,625
20 connection and achieve
your target or else...

278
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,792
Don't expect me to be formal...

279
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,958
You can leave, once for all

280
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,125
You will receive the salary
for the work which you didn't do

281
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,083
- Sir, actually...
- What?

282
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,375
Sir, I logged in
without accessing the ID

283
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,542
Great!

284
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,625
Go

285
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,583
Login after 2 minutes

286
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,208
I will e-mail

287
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,667
Will I die if I skip a meal?

288
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,333
He is ready too

289
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,250
I need to go to the
office after dropping him

290
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,125
If you are so concerned, you
should have prepared it early

291
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,500
Always hooked on to tik-tok

292
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,167
I deserve this for falling in love

293
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,667
'God must be born as a human'

294
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,458
'He must fall in love... "

295
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,625
You are so impossible

296
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,292
Oh no

297
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,583
I'm getting the call

298
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,750
I'm at TIDEL Park signal

299
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,417
I will cross the road and meet you there

300
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,000
- Your lunch?
- Dump it

301
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,125
Let's go

302
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,375
Monisha!

303
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,083
Get out

304
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,458
Come on

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,083
What are you staring at? Move!

306
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,458
(Caller tune playing)

307
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,958
How can I achieve the target and
complete my calls is this continues?

308
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:14,125
Wonder why they use phones!

309
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,083
She didn't call at all

310
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,958
I've reached the office, Bhagyalakshmi

311
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,292
The office is so dependent on me

312
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:31,833
I have to delegate works for all

313
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,333
So, I was so occupied

314
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,333
Shan, place the file on the table

315
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,125
Don't mind, sister

316
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,708
So, I forgot to call.
Had your breakfast?

317
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:42,833
- Yes
- And dad?

318
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,042
Your dad?

319
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,625
My husband is too mean

320
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,833
- What?
- He just came home...

321
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,292
he went to take a bath as
he wants to go out again

322
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,917
I'll continue in the lunch break

323
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,708
Hold on!

324
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,250
- Tell me
- Your dad had shared your horoscope

325
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,875
We have found a good match

326
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:08,583
So...

327
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,250
So?

328
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:14,667
Today is a very auspicious day

329
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:17,250
They wanted to make a visit

330
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,125
So, if you can come early...

331
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,375
Mom, are you so jobless?

332
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,958
You always torment with
marriage talks. Hang the phone

333
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,167
I said hang the phone

334
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,708
Hail Lord Ayyappa

335
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,750
Horrible!

336
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,167
There is none to question him

337
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,833
No one is serious about the job

338
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:56,167
Not sure why the manager
is targeting me and...

339
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,792
Get lost

340
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,250
Go to hell, you swine

341
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,583
Hold on... I'll show my worth

342
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,375
When you are so late...

343
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,917
why can't you bring the offerings?

344
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,583
I'm yet to visit the temple

345
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,917
Sorry. Forgive me My Lord

346
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,000
I'll get it for you too

347
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,125
Get lost

348
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,833
Hello... that's good

349
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,292
Horrible!

350
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,375
- Only loans over 1 crore would be waived off
- Please don't lean on me

351
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,958
Please go

352
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,292
- Thanks, Priya
- It's ok

353
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,250
Hope there is no issue

354
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,167
- Did the manager ask about me?
- No issues

355
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,292
- Thanks
- Sister...

356
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,458
I'm done with this...

357
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,708
Just take care of these. Okay?

358
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,125
- Bye
- I'll take care

359
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,708
Pass that, sir

360
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:01,792
The addresses are different on both ID's

361
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,417
What can I do about it?

362
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,250
I gave them the right address

363
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,417
The concerned authorities
got it printed wrongly

364
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,417
I have suffered a lot because of it

365
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,583
An old man like can't
fight the bureaucrats

366
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,458
They want me to do it online...
I have no clue and it's helpless

367
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,375
What can I do about that, sir?

368
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,792
Go and check it in the counter no. 8

369
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,583
There is no purpose in life

370
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,417
On average 20 people come
here with the same issue

371
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,917
It's not acceptable sir

372
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,000
They are working for namesake

373
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,125
They are not doing justice to their jobs

374
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,292
But they go on a strike for pay hikes

375
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,125
Am I right, kid?

376
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,500
So...

377
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,458
Your job is important than your son?

378
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,292
We took this job to run the family

379
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:42,167
As time goes by we
forget the real purpose

380
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,208
Your son is important

381
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,750
Go take care of him

382
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,000
Sethuram, you are called by manager

383
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,083
Coming

384
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,708
I'll request the manager

385
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,375
Call me for any help

386
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,292
There are many people lined up

387
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,708
You arrive late...

388
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,125
You are just gossiping and leaving

389
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,333
What do you think of yourself?

390
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,208
Employ someone whom you
will best suit the job

391
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,917
Madam... these are dirty mouths

392
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,500
(mobile ringtone playing)

393
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,917
- Is it Mrs. Krithika?
- Yes

394
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,833
Hi, madam, this is Nandhini

395
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,542
from Pathway Fibrenet

396
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,167
You are yet to renew
your internet connection

397
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,708
I've called up to know the reason

398
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,958
- I called to remind the renewal
- I'm amidst a critical situation...

399
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,792
try to understand

400
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:00,792
Call me in the evening

401
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,000
or tomorrow

402
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,583
We will together receive
an invitation. Please wait

403
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,500
- Get a packet of curd
- Alright

404
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,167
It's his last day...

405
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,083
yet look at his swag

406
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,167
I remember

407
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,333
I'm the guy from the island

408
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:01,875
I'll leave

409
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,208
- Who are you?
- Mugilan sent me

410
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,417
Why didn't Mugilan come?

411
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,833
He is ill, so he sent me

412
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:43,792
Okay, pass it on

413
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:46,125
Bill?

414
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,833
- Pay him
- Fine

415
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,375
Let's go

416
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,667
'FORENSIC DEPARTMENT'

417
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,458
- Is madam available?
- Yes she is. You can go inside

418
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,667
Please sit

419
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,083
Tell me

420
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,958
We are here to talk about
murder re-verification

421
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,042
We are expecting a comprehensive
investigation report

422
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,625
It's a 100% natural death

423
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,250
There is nothing to
suspect it to be a murder

424
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,458
The victims friend...

425
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,083
is a political influencer
and thus pressuring us

426
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,000
One of his friends died the next
day of the first friend's death

427
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,417
Even we smell something fishy

428
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,500
You are pressurized using
their political influence

429
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,833
If there has been series of deaths...

430
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,000
what if they committed some crime?

431
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:41,167
May be is the culprit...

432
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,000
and trying to deceive you

433
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,750
First interrogate him

434
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,708
Excuse me

435
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,333
Greetings... Yes?

436
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,042
Where?

437
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,125
What's this, sir?

438
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,208
If the body was in the water for
3 days, a spot PM was a mandate

439
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,125
Got a requisition from the Judge?

440
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,375
I'm coming

441
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,042
I'll bring them

442
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,667
This is not a natural death for sure

443
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,208
It's a murder

444
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,125
(Singing a song)

445
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:29,625
There comes the bison.
Let's pull his leg

446
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,833
(Gibberish)

447
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:36,833
That's not the pronunciation...

448
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,958
- What?
- 'Kuch Nayi'(Nothing)

449
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:46,917
You called me a dog?

450
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,000
It's not dog...

451
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,417
It means nothing

452
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,333
Then scoot

453
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,458
I will tackle you after
learning this language

454
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:55,875
Si sae swami...

455
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,542
That's not my name...
that is S. Srinivasan

456
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,417
I will address the same way hereafter

457
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,083
- Don't you visit Sabarimala?
- Why should I?

458
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:06,958
The court has granted
permission to women. So...

459
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,083
I want to reach by walk...

460
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,667
- Would you accompany me?
- No!

461
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,583
I chose this job as this
premises has an elevator

462
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,125
Please spare me

463
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,667
He is such a funny guy

464
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,833
Why did you switch on the fan

465
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,208
You seem to be lost in thoughts?

466
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,125
Nothing...

467
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,833
Rathnavelu had called...

468
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,917
His son has applied for a divorce

469
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,625
What?

470
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,750
We attended their wedding recently

471
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,208
It's not even a week

472
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,625
What's so serious?

473
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:57,208
The modern age youngsters have
adapted to living together...

474
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:01,000
Culture development and so on

475
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:05,125
they want everything in a jiffy...

476
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:06,583
barring death

477
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,958
For instance, our son..

478
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:10,875
He will not visit us...

479
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:15,917
when we wish to visit him, he
states some reason to stop it

480
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,625
He has stopped using Skype too

481
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,917
Let's see

482
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,333
His daughter will get married...

483
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,458
and their relationship will suffer

484
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:30,542
Only then he will realize our pain

485
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,167
Why are you cursing him?

486
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,583
Do you think I'm cursing?

487
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,083
No father will do it to his son

488
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,417
It a figurative speech

489
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:45,167
My pension amount is
masking our son's absence

490
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,708
What a life?

491
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:54,583
At-least you are next to me to comfort

492
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,125
That's enough

493
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,958
Why are you acting weird?

494
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,542
I'll kiss my wife

495
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,667
What's so weird in it?

496
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,792
Come closer...

497
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,500
What? No!

498
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,833
There comes the spoilsport

499
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,000
Pick the phone

500
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,167
Who's that?

501
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,875
Greetings! Is it Mr. Karunakaran?

502
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,792
Yes

503
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,583
I'm calling from Pathway Fibrenet

504
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,583
Can I know the reason for not renewing
your connection for the past 2 months?

505
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,292
I bought this internet connection...

506
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,875
to talk with my son, who is abroad

507
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,792
But he doesn't talk to me

508
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,375
Even if I call him...

509
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,333
he doesn't want me to disturb him

510
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,708
He uninstalled Skype too

511
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,458
Why waste money on it?

512
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,458
So, I didn't renew

513
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,000
You would have used to beat
him a lot when he was a kid

514
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,917
I guess that's why he is not calling you

515
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,000
Kids should be beaten

516
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,458
just like my dad

517
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,833
I didn't do it too

518
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,250
10 years have passed
since I last saw him

519
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,583
He is not eager to meet his parents

520
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,917
That's not to be taught
it should be innate

521
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,542
- What's your son's name?
- Moorthy

522
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:20,083
Who's on the line?

523
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,792
It's regarding internet connection

524
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,667
- Mind your business
- Yes, it's the need of the hour

525
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,917
Sorry. I'm just cribbing about problems

526
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,375
It's ok, sir

527
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:36,292
I don't need the connection.
You can permanently disconnect it

528
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,708
Are you sure about it?

529
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,250
Yes

530
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,958
I will request the
concerned team to contact you

531
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,000
It has the details of all the callers

532
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,167
I will share you immediately

533
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,542
The details from the third row...

534
00:36:58,542 --> 00:36:59,500
I'll fill it up

535
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,500
Yashika from Pathway...

536
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,542
Come on, let's go

537
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,833
- Come on
- You leave

538
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,500
I have ordered imported drug

539
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,125
I'll leave after sniffing it

540
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,542
You are already high

541
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,667
Listen to me, don't kill yourself

542
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,958
I've made up my mind

543
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,542
- You go
- Let's go

544
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,792
Kid!

545
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,458
Here's your imported drug

546
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,375
What took you so long?

547
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,208
I've managed this with great difficulty

548
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,583
I got this with the help
of political influence

549
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,542
Payment please

550
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,417
Here you go

551
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,083
See you

552
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,208
- Stop... where is your helmet?
- Go... meet the officer

553
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,833
- Sir...
- Park aside

554
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,667
Come on

555
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,708
- I've got some emergency work
- I got all the requisites

556
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,583
then why make wait? Give me the keys

557
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,542
Reminding me the rules?

558
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,458
I can get money either way

559
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,042
You aren't aware of the
traffic rules yet get a license

560
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:36,958
and roam around

561
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,667
The rule says you must not take the keys

562
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,583
- Show me your license
- No proper records

563
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,958
Greetings, sir

564
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,583
These people are going overboard

565
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:49,958
They go on a strike for everything

566
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,583
We aren't getting paid well

567
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,500
- What's the offense?
- He is showing off

568
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:56,667
Hey!

569
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:58,833
Do you know what's lane change?

570
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm talking to you

571
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,667
Do you know what's lane change?

572
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,167
You know nothing and
yet roam around in bikes

573
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,208
File a case

574
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,417
Everyone wants to be a hero

575
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,958
Sir, it's 'stop signal'

576
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,125
Get me the lathi... Some
moron will get caught now

577
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:20,917
Oh no!

578
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,167
Come on

579
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,042
Get some water

580
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,417
My son!

581
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,083
I did no wrong

582
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:52,042
Call an ambulance

583
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,125
Someone get an auto... water please

584
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,667
I'm alright

585
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,542
- Are you stone-hearted? -Why
are so obsessed with money?

586
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,667
You can't be happy with the bribe

587
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,458
He was not my target

588
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,583
Drink this

589
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,792
Guys like you must be taught a lesson

590
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,917
I targeted another who jumped the signal

591
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:16,708
Don't hit me. Hey head constable...

592
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:19,958
- Call the control room
- This head constable Pazhani reporting

593
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,125
There is a ruckus in St, Thomas Mount

594
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,208
Mr. Rajendran is requesting
for an immediate force

595
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,208
Please make it fast

596
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:02,458
"O' women, you will rise from the dark"

597
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:14,208
"You have an undaunted heart"

598
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:19,958
"No more tears... it's
the time to taste success"

599
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:25,625
"The world will be at your feat"

600
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:29,083
"The times are in your favour"

601
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,208
"It's time to reign"

602
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,833
"Time to get over your sufferings"

603
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,708
"Time to wear a smile on your face"

604
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,042
"Unpredictability makes
life more aesthetic"

605
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:48,542
"A bed of roses is far-fetched"

606
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:08,500
"O' woman warrior you shall
triumph in the battlefield"

607
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:15,042
"You shall lead the victory parade"

608
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:20,500
"It's a materialistic marathon
in this transitory life"

609
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:26,500
"Can you stopped by ignoramus?"

610
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,042
"Life is short... Don't
you realize it, O' flower"

611
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:37,750
"Be daring to achieve"

612
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:43,292
"This is just the beginning
of your victorious march"

613
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:52,417
"Your success stories
will be heard for eternity"

614
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,583
"Unpredictability makes
life more aesthetic"

615
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:05,125
"A bed of roses is far-fetched"

616
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,625
Hello... Hey!

617
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,083
I'm listening... go on

618
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:20,167
Ram has gone to the island in a boat

619
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,250
Mugilan had got him liquor and stuff

620
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,708
Yes...

621
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:28,083
The location was exotic

622
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,250
You missed it

623
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,917
Don't miss the next trip

624
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,792
I got your bike parked...

625
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,708
- What happened?
- Hold on

626
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,625
- I'm getting another call... will revert
- Okay

627
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,750
- Hello, yes?
- Hi sir, this is Nandhini

628
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,167
Nandhini?

629
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:47,250
I'm calling from Pathway...
you are to renew your data pack

630
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,417
Forget that

631
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,333
Give me your personal number

632
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,167
The network strength is low

633
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,125
I'll call you

634
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,333
Your are talking inappropriately

635
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,792
I'm not bluffing Nandhini

636
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,458
Hello... See I'm not able to hear you

637
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,958
- We handle a lot of perverted...
- What?

638
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,625
customers

639
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,000
Else I'll connect the
call to the team lead

640
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,417
Go ahead. I'm not scared

641
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,208
Annoying...

642
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,958
Miss. Sangeetha

643
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:24,875
Miss. Sangeetha

644
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:27,667
- What?
- Your pizza has been delivered

645
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,375
I'll keep it in the food
court locker. Please take it

646
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:31,042
What?

647
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,750
The pizza has been delivered!

648
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm hungry. Let's go take a bite

649
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,542
Come on...

650
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,583
I'm yet to complete even 10 calls

651
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,500
No one is renewing

652
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,458
I'm scared of the consequences

653
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,000
You can call them later

654
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:48,542
None will question you

655
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,208
It's hard to eat if its cold

656
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,875
- Come on
- Okay

657
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,042
Let me log out

658
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,958
I'm hungry

659
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,875
Shall I accompany you?

660
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,750
I've ordered a chicken pizza
as you would ask a chunk

661
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,125
Wish I didn't take the sacred vow

662
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,042
Lord Ayyapa

663
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:13,417
It's chicken pizza

664
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:14,625
Wanna taste it?

665
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:17,042
Are you fasting?

666
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,125
Talk...

667
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,417
I've been calling you since morning,
but you keep disconnecting it

668
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,000
Who are you? Why are you beating her?

669
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,833
I will slay you... Don't dare

670
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,958
Hey!

671
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,208
Where are you taking her?

672
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,250
Let her go

673
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,333
The ID carries the name
of Nandhini Govindan

674
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:08,167
Maybe if it a dead body of a woman?

675
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,042
They are inter related

676
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,875
The third member of
the friends gang is dead

677
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,042
They have killed him and made
it look like a natural death

678
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:23,500
Someone who knows me, rather who
is very close to me is behind this

679
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,583
I had a petty task

680
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,042
it took sometime to finish it

681
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:48,375
There were no ears to
hear my words on the day

682
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,833
Because people who I was
trying to communicate...

683
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:58,750
were stuck into the
issues of routine lifestyle

684
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,667
If that had not happened...

685
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:05,625
Nandhini...

686
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,083
Nandhini...

687
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,333
Nandhu...

688
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,292
Nandhu... Hey Nandhini!

689
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:18,917
What?

690
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,375
The smell of your food is luring me

691
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,875
Your mom is a good cook too

692
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,375
Share me some

693
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:29,875
A little bit

694
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,333
Hey... where are you going?

695
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,292
Nandhu...

696
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,417
I don't want your food

697
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,708
Stupid!

698
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,333
It would be good if she arrives early

699
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:48,333
What are you doing? Had food?

700
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,958
-What about you?
-I'm done

701
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,750
Tell me, dad

702
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,667
Uncle is here to invite for
his house warming ceremony

703
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:56,333
He is here. Would you talk to him?

704
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:59,250
-I'm occupied, dad
-Okay

705
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:02,583
-Okay, bye
-Bye

706
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:18,917
Why are you crying?

707
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,792
Things never turn out
the way we want to, right?

708
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,333
What?

709
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:25,750
What happened?

710
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,708
-Nothing
-It's okay

711
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,583
Why is she crying?

712
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,875
Thrash me the next
time I ask you something

713
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:38,917
Sure

714
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:42,625
let's go talk privately

715
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,958
Come on...

716
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,500
get up

717
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:52,500
Something that I had kept to myself...

718
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:57,750
I don't know why, but I
want to share it with you

719
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,625
I was 8 years old then

720
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,500
'Think positive'

721
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,292
Don't disturb, uncle

722
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:17,917
Grandmother and I are
going to get some clothes

723
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,625
Be a good girl

724
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,292
What?

725
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:24,667
I copied that. Please
don't obstruct the TV

726
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,333
Look at her

727
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,750
I'm leaving. Take care of her

728
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,083
Nandhini...

729
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:38,333
-Do you like Popeye?
-Yeah

730
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,167
Nandhini...

731
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,167
Come here and sit on my lap

732
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,708
No, I won't

733
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,708
Come on... I'm your uncle

734
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,667
-What's your favorite subject?
-Science

735
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,125
Who is your favorite teacher?

736
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,958
Come on, tell me

737
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,875
Don't do it, uncle

738
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,708
I'm your uncle

739
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:17,125
Nothing to worry

740
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,833
Okay?

741
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:21,792
That horrific experience...

742
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,208
left an eternal scar on my life

743
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,917
I never experienced that such
a thing would ever happen to me

744
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:36,000
That was not the end of it

745
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,083
5 years starting from that incident

746
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,958
I experienced that bloody pain

747
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:45,042
Mom, I'm the topper

748
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,000
It is floating up after getting fried

749
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,417
Where is Nandhu?

750
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:55,542
Nandhu? She was...

751
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,833
-She is bathing
-Alright

752
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:04,125
Nandhini...

753
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:10,625
Nandhini...

754
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,542
I caught you... You are out

755
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,333
You are out

756
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,542
Hey Nandhini

757
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,875
-Come here
-I'm playing

758
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,417
I said come here

759
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,500
Hey!

760
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,958
Take her to the shop

761
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:36,250
You too join us, mom. Please!

762
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,417
He said that he will take you

763
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,542
You have exams tomorrow

764
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,167
You need to prepare

765
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:43,458
There you go. It has cash in it

766
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,833
Come on

767
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:52,833
Like any other kid...

768
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,167
I should have been enjoying my childhood

769
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,167
but after the incident...

770
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,667
I hated my life

771
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:07,208
I had many sleepless nights

772
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,208
I had cried by burying
my mouth in a pillow...

773
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,500
to make sure that mom doesn't hear it

774
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:18,000
My head bursts thinking of it

775
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:24,708
I was not able to concentrate on
studies because of sleeplessness

776
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,875
and I got punished by the teachers

777
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,292
As a result of it...

778
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,875
though the men whom I
came cross were innocent...

779
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,292
because of the untoward incident...

780
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,875
I became phobic

781
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,667
Get in, kid

782
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,000
You were good at your studies...
Why did your score drop?

783
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,125
You were good at studies...

784
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,792
Why did you score less?

785
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,167
What are you studying?

786
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,333
What are you studying?

787
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:02,083
Nandhini...

788
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:09,292
What?

789
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:10,500
-What happened?
-What happened?

790
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:11,750
It's okay

791
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,625
-Let go see a doctor
-Come, dear

792
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:19,833
-Take a deep breath
-What?

793
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:22,250
Take a deep breath

794
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,292
Nothing...

795
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:28,792
I'm here

796
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,667
Did I ever trouble you?

797
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,750
Why are not letting me
have a peaceful life?

798
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,875
Once I grew up enough to
realize these things...

799
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,542
Then I reached a stage where
I could live off my own...

800
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,458
I did things I hated the most

801
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,250
You made my hate my life

802
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,667
Can someone make my life which...

803
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,792
I had dreamed of?

804
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,542
I love my dad

805
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,917
I like him very much

806
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,542
But...

807
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:28,833
at one stage...

808
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,792
Get me a mug, honey

809
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:35,792
I won't

810
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,833
I won't

811
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:40,500
Get me a mug, honey

812
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:46,000
I won't do it... I won't

813
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:48,667
All I asked is a mug

814
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,333
Why is she scared?

815
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:54,417
No kid must come across
a situation where...

816
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,125
she fears her father

817
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:09,625
We are sorry

818
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:13,375
-We didn't notice you praying
-It's okay

819
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,542
-Sorry Zarina
-Not a problem

820
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,375
We are alive at this moment

821
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,917
This is the real truth

822
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,417
Oh the Almighty

823
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,542
Thanks to God

824
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,417
If everyone has clear mind as her...

825
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:50,333
there won't be any issues, right?

826
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:53,917
Nandhu!

827
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:56,583
Is your uncle still troubling you?

828
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,667
When I was in my ninth grade...

829
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,625
the class was buzzing
on that particular day

830
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:05,792
That was a biology class

831
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:10,042
My class representative had written 'Sexual Reproduction'
- the topic for the day

832
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,375
The teacher asked us to do self-study on
the topic and skipped to the next lesson

833
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,458
and she started drawing animal cell

834
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:22,750
I was wondering why did she skip the
lesson when she is too good otherwise

835
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,667
Later I learned it from one of my friend

836
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,500
I spoiled my life
without proper awareness

837
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,667
I started hating myself for it

838
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:34,500
I warned him that I will inform my
parents about it if he repeats it

839
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,875
He stopped troubling me since then

840
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:40,000
Whatever may be the reason, you
should have informed your parents

841
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,708
You did a mistake

842
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,542
What else do you expect?

843
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,125
All I knew was something was happening

844
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,750
But I couldn't take a decision...

845
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,417
to free myself from it

846
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:57,500
All I wanted is just to escape

847
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,667
I had no control over my actions...

848
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,167
I couldn't concentrate on studies...

849
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,208
and I fell into the
below average category

850
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,500
I couldn't enjoy any moment...

851
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:08,708
and never been happy

852
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,292
As my uncle threatened
me not to disclose it...

853
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,542
and as I was phobic...

854
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,375
I didn't eat and sleep for many days...

855
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,042
I had to live with the pain

856
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,375
But my mom's inference was spot on

857
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,083
that I was abnormal

858
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,417
If the other person
in this relationship...

859
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:31,792
spill the beans

860
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,750
though I was never interested in it...

861
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,625
I was afraid that I would be victimized

862
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:40,208
also fearing that it
will defame my parents...

863
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:41,917
my fear

864
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,042
stopped me from disclosing it

865
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:51,000
This is quite a shocking revelation

866
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,333
I thought as you are unable to
achieve your official target...

867
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:59,625
and hence you were crestfallen thinking
about leaving the job and leaving us

868
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,958
but here I'm learning shocking truth

869
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:06,458
Things are happening all around
about which we have no clue

870
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,083
They are crossing the line

871
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:11,375
Oh God, please descend on earth

872
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,000
There are many to be decimated

873
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,333
Nandhu...

874
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,625
Let's go visit a
psychiatrist in the evening

875
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,125
to get you counseled

876
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:24,958
But I have got one

877
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:27,125
When did this happen?

878
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:30,500
I was scared to make a visit in person

879
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:31,542
I was scared of being judged

880
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:36,042
I saw a tele-medical show on TV

881
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,583
I called and talked to them

882
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,042
I said I was feeling depressed

883
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,583
They said I was mentally affected...

884
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:44,958
and suggested me to meditate

885
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,125
I tried it for a few days

886
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,333
I could notice some changes

887
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,708
Lately I'm coming out of it

888
00:59:51,917 --> 00:59:52,875
You spoke to a doctor?

889
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,583
On TV?

890
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,708
So you were alone at home?

891
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:58,917
Yes

892
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,500
You...

893
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:03,708
You are impossible

894
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,000
I forgot to say something important

895
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,708
What?

896
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,042
Call for you. You keep
talking, I'll be back

897
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,167
Yes, Lakshmi?

898
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:20,500
Your voice seems to be quavering?

899
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,875
I don't think so

900
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,500
-Okay. Had your lunch?
-Yeah

901
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:30,125
The thing I had told you...

902
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,292
did you give a thought about it?

903
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:35,250
It's fine even if you come by 6

904
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,333
Why don't you understand, mom?

905
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,208
You are just focussed
on your thing, right?

906
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:44,042
I'm juggling things like anything

907
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,500
I don't know how to explain

908
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,333
Disconnect the call

909
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,667
Madam, the time is 2

910
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,583
I don't get it

911
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:57,750
Time is just 2 O' clock

912
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,875
2 O' clock? Are you sure?

913
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,250
So soon?

914
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:02,750
I have to complete my target

915
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,042
-Kanna?
-It's not Kanna, it's me

916
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:27,958
You are home early?

917
01:01:28,042 --> 01:01:29,667
I was at office till 2

918
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,167
I went there just for
marking my presence

919
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,417
Cops were arresting some people

920
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,792
I thought being there
till evening does no good

921
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:39,500
So, I came home

922
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,625
If I join the protest...

923
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:46,208
they mark me absent with no pay...

924
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,875
and yet they ask me
to come on Saturday too

925
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,667
If go the office...

926
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:52,250
'We are here demanding
a fair pay for our labor'

927
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,875
'We are protesting yet you
are going to the office'

928
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:55,792
People criticise me

929
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:56,792
I'm struggling to balance

930
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:00,792
So hard!

931
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:04,750
None

932
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,708
I'm controlling it for quite sometime

933
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:09,625
I need to pass urine

934
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:11,792
Get me the douchebag

935
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,833
You should have let me
know as soon as I was here

936
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:16,750
Where is Kamala?

937
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:18,250
She seemed to be sad since morning

938
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:20,292
Not sure what happened

939
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,875
After a while, she reluctantly
disclosed that her son has jaundice

940
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:26,167
I sent her off to take care of her son

941
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,208
Yet...

942
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,250
she prepared me the lunch before leaving

943
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,500
Okay

944
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,375
What are you doing?

945
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You said you want to urinate

946
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,708
Its period time. Please
get me the douchebag

947
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,167
I got scared

948
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:41,500
Come on

949
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,042
If I can catch some
impurity by touching you...

950
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,750
Our son whom you gave
birth to is an impure

951
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,042
Let him comeback from school...

952
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,500
I'll dump him in the trash can

953
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:04,833
As you became bedridden for last
year because of Multiple sclerosis...

954
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,750
I'm the one who's taking
care of you, right?

955
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,875
Yet you are hesitant?

956
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,458
Correct

957
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,417
Kamala or mom would
take care of such things

958
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:15,875
You have to go for work

959
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,125
I must not disturb you too

960
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,417
This is not a trouble

961
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:21,750
You sit properly

962
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,833
Don't slide down. Milk is getting
boiled. I'll go take care of it

963
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:30,833
Done, Bhanu?

964
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,250
Had I had this problem...

965
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:41,167
before you got married to me

966
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,417
would you have still married me?

967
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:44,500
Why ponder about it now?

968
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,792
You would have said yes

969
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:50,042
But I would have given a second thought

970
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:53,167
You are so mean? The
bigger secrets are out now

971
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,750
I think I'm getting
a call from the office

972
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,292
I'll go check it

973
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,042
Is it Mr.Rajasekar?

974
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,125
-Yes and you are?
-I'm calling from Pathway Fibrenet

975
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,042
You are yet to renew...

976
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:21,250
May I know the reason?

977
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,875
Hold on!

978
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,583
Remove the shoes and then get in

979
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:26,333
Continue...

980
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:29,917
It has been days since
your last date for renewal

981
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,542
-and hence the reminder call.
-Fine

982
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,708
When will you activate it?

983
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:38,292
I was busy... No problem
I'll do it by morning

984
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,167
You shall receive a link...

985
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:45,250
Once you pay using the
link, you will get an offer

986
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,625
If you do it by tomorrow, you
will get 100 GB of extra data

987
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:49,250
Thank you, sir

988
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,792
It's available in different speeds

989
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:29,667
I would suggest that a 1-year package
would be useful rather than 6 months

990
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,750
There are packages for 3 months too

991
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,292
You made any renewals?

992
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:46,042
Why is he roaming
around more than usual?

993
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,167
I'll be back

994
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:54,167
Hi sir, this is me, Biju

995
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,750
As we discussed earlier...

996
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,375
this will be the last day for the girl

997
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,208
Yes...

998
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,250
That will not happen

999
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:06,750
She will quit for sure

1000
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:08,833
You need worry

1001
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,167
Ask your daughter to
visit our Chennai office

1002
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:15,708
Certificates? That
shouldn't be a problem

1003
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,958
I'm the incharge here

1004
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,625
That you can submit a week later

1005
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,042
Not a problem

1006
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:23,333
Our MD...

1007
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,375
is very close to me

1008
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,000
I will take care

1009
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,375
I'll disconnect the call

1010
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,042
You moron

1011
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,708
Nandhu!

1012
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,833
Nandhu!!

1013
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,750
Nandhu...

1014
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:46,083
-What happened?
-We got a problem

1015
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:47,333
Problem? For you?

1016
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:49,250
Not for me but for you

1017
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,667
For me? What is it?

1018
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,083
The manager has made
up his mind to fire you

1019
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:56,917
He is trying to replace you
with one of his acquaintance

1020
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,625
What?

1021
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,042
I heard it. I swear

1022
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,208
Do something

1023
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,792
My dad got voluntary retirement

1024
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:08,667
It takes at least 3
months to find another job

1025
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,500
I don't know why this happens to just me

1026
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,792
Oh God!

1027
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:25,500
Look at this

1028
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,417
-Take it
-What's this?

1029
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,083
Take a look

1030
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:34,417
'Around 9.30 PM, near Kamatchi
hospital, Velachery...'

1031
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:37,750
'a residential multistorey
building collapsed'

1032
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,125
'more than 40 people have
died which includes 6 kids'

1033
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,458
'sources say that others are
getting treated in a hospital'

1034
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:48,792
'Fire rescue men and other
NGO's are working together...'

1035
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,958
'in the rescue operation'

1036
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:53,375
-'Chennai district collector...'
-What a pity?!

1037
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:56,250
You now said...

1038
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,625
why are you alone got so many problems?

1039
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,292
Who doesn't have problems?

1040
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,500
For many, this would
have been a dream house

1041
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:10,292
Despite knowing that it's risky
to construct an apartment there...

1042
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,625
people deliberately choose this

1043
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:17,000
Obviously, they have to
face the consequences too

1044
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:23,500
My daughter Yazhini...

1045
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,458
Remember her getting
gelled along with you?

1046
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:31,167
But, when I think of the fact that
she will never see her dad again...

1047
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:32,833
do you know, how painful the thought is?

1048
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,292
I first ever saw him in
our marriage engagement

1049
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:42,667
Our wedding took place within a week

1050
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:47,500
He moved back to the army camp
after 10 days of our wedding

1051
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:49,625
Later...

1052
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,750
he returned 2 months
after Yazhini was born

1053
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,375
Even then he stayed only for 5 days

1054
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,417
All of a sudden he called me

1055
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,792
'I'm in a war zone'

1056
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,458
'A bullet has pierced me'

1057
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,167
'It's hard to survive' he said so

1058
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,542
I was totally perplexed

1059
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,917
***

1060
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:32,833
But me as a single mother...

1061
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:35,000
I'm ready to give her everything
what he would have done

1062
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,583
But people around me...

1063
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,875
You don't let these affect you

1064
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,542
I'm sharing my grief

1065
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,417
-Everyone has problems
-Nandhu

1066
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,833
Excuse me?

1067
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,583
Don't be so formal. Please come

1068
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:55,875
It's okay

1069
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,458
I've been observing since morning

1070
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:01,792
I sense that your mind
is caught in turbulence

1071
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,083
Treat it as a sister's advice

1072
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:06,875
Love everyone but don't trust anyone

1073
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,583
Don't get me wrong

1074
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,208
I'm speaking out of my experience

1075
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,583
Everyone will have to get
separated from their loved ones

1076
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:18,208
As the products have a validity date...

1077
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,125
so do the humans

1078
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:22,792
We are born with an expiry date

1079
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,083
Things will get better for a
good hearted person like you

1080
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:30,125
Celebrate your life

1081
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,250
If had wasted your time...

1082
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,458
Forgive me

1083
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,500
-Not at all
-okay, bye

1084
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:37,750
Okay

1085
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:47,250
You wanted to share something important

1086
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,667
It's him

1087
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:01,083
He is stalking me over the phone

1088
01:11:01,542 --> 01:11:02,542
Better than me?

1089
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,333
I guess you wouldn't
have discussed this too

1090
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,458
Tell me

1091
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:11,583
Let me talk

1092
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,792
He will never cross your way

1093
01:11:13,792 --> 01:11:14,750
You might blew up the issue

1094
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,417
Who is he?

1095
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:20,542
-I don't know
-What?

1096
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,708
What do you mean?

1097
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:23,625
Why is he calling you?

1098
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:27,250
Who shared your number?

1099
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:29,167
I did

1100
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,708
Whom do you think I am?

1101
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,792
A dumbo

1102
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:40,917
-I'm getting disturbed here
-I don't want to kill a devotee

1103
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,208
Mind your business

1104
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,292
What shall I do now?

1105
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,125
You are piling up shocking news

1106
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,292
You made some shocking revelations
about your uncle at noon

1107
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:53,417
Now you are saying that you had
shared your number to a stranger

1108
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:55,542
What happened to you?

1109
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:59,417
2 weeks ago I got a
friend request on Facebook

1110
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:02,750
I didn't accept it for 2 days

1111
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,083
-Then?
-'You are beautiful'

1112
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:09,958
received this message in the messenger

1113
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,375
That will do

1114
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,708
-Go on
-What happened was...

1115
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,125
It made think

1116
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,542
Who would be that?

1117
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:24,125
I was thinking if it was a prank

1118
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,500
I didn't want to do it...

1119
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:29,625
But I replied to him. 'who is this?'

1120
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:32,750
Then?

1121
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,208
The sign displayed was just a tick

1122
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,583
As it didn't notify as 'seen'...

1123
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,958
it made me more anxious

1124
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:45,000
I know that this was so new to me

1125
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,792
-Yet...
-There's someone who praised my beauty

1126
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:52,792
Laughing at me?

1127
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,542
You must be...

1128
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,583
Go on

1129
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,500
2 hours later...

1130
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:17,583
These were his messages

1131
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,042
You had already revealed the climax

1132
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:22,667
-What happened next?
-I shared my number

1133
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,792
This is a universal mistake

1134
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,833
You deliberately get
caught in the web...

1135
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,583
then you blame it on the fate

1136
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:33,792
I'm saying this on
your face 'You are ugly'

1137
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,583
Let me see if you will
unfriend or block me

1138
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,875
-You are smart in such things
-Actually...

1139
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:44,750
I avoided him after I learned his motive

1140
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:47,167
None will approach you
if you are strong enough

1141
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Others' behavior depends on yours

1142
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:53,750
If your thoughts and
actions are aligned...

1143
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:56,333
evil things will never cross your path

1144
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,458
I'm pretty sure about this

1145
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:01,333
You are facing these problems
because you let it happen

1146
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:06,583
If you avoid unnecessary things,
none will face any problems

1147
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,625
You share everything with your parents

1148
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,875
but you do not share
the important things

1149
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,875
There comes the droopy face

1150
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:19,542
Feel for it

1151
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,458
Feeling guilty?

1152
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,542
You are yet to leave?

1153
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:28,458
I'm not talking to you but her

1154
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:30,583
Carry on

1155
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,667
She is going through a bad phase

1156
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,417
Time up

1157
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:36,583
Good

1158
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,083
I have to achieve my target

1159
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,375
God, make sure this call turns out good

1160
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:15,167
I have a broken arm. Can you
please drop by the hospital?

1161
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:17,083
I don't know you. How
can I take a stranger?

1162
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:21,917
Need to pick my daughter on
the way too. Please help me, sir

1163
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:23,292
Get in

1164
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,333
Let's go

1165
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:32,083
Please speed up

1166
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,667
My daughter is all alone

1167
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,292
Not so rash, a tad slow

1168
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,042
Please accelerate a bit, sir

1169
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,042
Not so rash, a tad slow

1170
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:53,500
Why don't you get t?

1171
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,458
This is my drop point

1172
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,333
-Stop at the right, sir
-There is a divider on the right

1173
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,292
It's okay, sir. Please pull over

1174
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:09,750
You said you need to pick
your daughter. Where is she?

1175
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,375
What are you doing?

1176
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,167
Come on

1177
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,708
Give me the syringe

1178
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:59,375
'Some people live without actually
realizing what life is all about'

1179
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,750
-'It has to be enjoyed...'
-Manager is here

1180
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:05,833
'If you wish to enjoy your life...'

1181
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,958
'you have to enjoy the things around
you, i.e., you have to show love'

1182
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,542
'There are many who
don't know what love is'

1183
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:16,167
'Our childish mistakes that
we do at a younger age...'

1184
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:19,042
'are judged rationally by the
parents and they correct us'

1185
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,417
'But do commit childish
mistakes when they grow old'

1186
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:25,500
'we must not take them
seriously and rationally...'

1187
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,958
'correct their course'

1188
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:31,042
'What are you going to achieve by
getting angry in this temporary life?'

1189
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:33,208
'Do you know what's our biggest mistake?

1190
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,583
'The one who loves us the most...'

1191
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:38,958
'is the one who gets rebuked
as we take them for granted'

1192
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,208
Look at the contradiction

1193
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,375
"Time passes by..."

1194
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:58,417
"leaving some scars"

1195
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:02,708
"It etches some ever lasting..."

1196
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:08,458
"memories on me"

1197
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:13,292
-"I was so close to my mom..."
-Mom

1198
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:18,083
-'yet I was so far from her"
-Call me 'mom'

1199
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,875
"I fought with her"

1200
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,167
"I distanced her"

1201
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:27,667
-"She celebrates words uttered by me"
-You mustn't get anything from strangers

1202
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:30,583
-"My heart goes soft at your glimpse"
-Okay, mom

1203
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:32,000
You must report it to me

1204
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,667
-"Your words will melt even the hardest men"
-Faster, dad

1205
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:40,042
"Time passes by..."

1206
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:45,083
"leaving some scars"

1207
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:49,625
"It etches some ever lasting..."

1208
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:53,708
"memories on me"

1209
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,875
-I don't want to eat
-This is not meat

1210
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,667
It is from a plant.
It tastes good. Have it

1211
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,458
Really?

1212
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,750
-Good?
-It's great

1213
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:04,750
I guessed it right

1214
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,125
What are you doing?

1215
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,167
Reprimand her

1216
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:14,833
She is a kid after all

1217
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:21,333
Students will drag into a fight

1218
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,333
They will brag to get
into a physical fight

1219
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,667
You mustn't hit them

1220
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,083
-I won't hit, But shall I bite?
-Heard that?

1221
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,667
Talkative!

1222
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,292
The God's here

1223
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:37,417
-I will give it
-Careful

1224
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,875
Why are you crying?

1225
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:47,250
-What happened, Lakshmi?
-I have been asking her for quite sometime

1226
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,875
I used to be the topper always

1227
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:53,500
The teacher scolded me in the class
for slipping down to 3rd position

1228
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:54,583
That's it?

1229
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:59,292
If you study well, you can
decide your paycheque...

1230
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:03,792
if you study to become the topper,
others will decide your worth

1231
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:06,542
-Which one will you choose?
-I'll study well

1232
01:20:06,542 --> 01:20:08,708
That's my girl

1233
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,792
-I'll lift it
-Go ahead

1234
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,333
-What?
-You carry on

1235
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,333
Oh no!

1236
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,500
I strike

1237
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,833
Don't worry. Now you roll the dice

1238
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,500
-Come on
-Good

1239
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:36,708
We have earned a good reputation here

1240
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:42,250
similarly, you must not spoil
our reputation in the new place

1241
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,417
-Okay?
-Fine. Hold this

1242
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:47,500
Pass that

1243
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:51,375
We running late. I
need go to the job too

1244
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:54,458
-I need to prepare.
-Just eat this

1245
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:57,125
Open your mouth

1246
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:01,917
"I want to see the
world on your shoulders"

1247
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:06,250
"This is all I wish for"

1248
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:11,250
"I'm caught in this illusional cobweb"

1249
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:15,833
"This is an eternal web spun with lies"

1250
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:20,417
"My hear is heavy with guilt"

1251
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,250
Nandhini from Pathway Fibrenet

1252
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:28,458
2 days have passed since
your internet disconnection

1253
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:34,208
-Lizard
-What happened?

1254
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,542
You are making a hell
of noise for the lizard?

1255
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,917
I wonder how are going
to face this society

1256
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,083
Take bath and come soon

1257
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:49,917
"It etches some ever
lasting memories on me"

1258
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:53,167
'Did you realize the
loss you have incurred?'

1259
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,042
'We have to embrace happiness..."

1260
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,875
'and be content with our life"

1261
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,875
'We forget everything
as time passes by..."

1262
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,792
"and start living the
deformed lifestyle"

1263
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,125
Nandhu!

1264
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:11,042
-Still, thinking about it?
-This is different

1265
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,458
Okay

1266
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:14,500
Another one?

1267
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,125
Hello, Lakshmi

1268
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,958
What are you doing?

1269
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,208
Surprisingly, you have
called at this time?

1270
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,458
Just a casual call

1271
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:37,958
Had coffee?

1272
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:40,542
We are out of milk. Your
dad has gone to buy it

1273
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:47,833
Today is an auspicious day...
I finished drying the clothes...

1274
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:49,750
I'm preparing sweets

1275
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,625
I forgot that it was an auspicious day

1276
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,083
You too celebrate these days?

1277
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,125
Nothing important...

1278
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:00,625
you asked me to come early,
right? I can't make it at 5.30

1279
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,625
I will come at 6.30

1280
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,208
Okay

1281
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:08,375
Uncle was here

1282
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,458
along with the family

1283
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:13,125
Dad had informed me

1284
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,208
that uncle had made a visit

1285
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,333
Uncle? Oh God

1286
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,625
What happened?

1287
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,125
Nothing...

1288
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,333
I will disconnect the call

1289
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,042
-You might be busy
-Hold on for a minute

1290
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:31,292
What?

1291
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,958
I wanted to ask something...

1292
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:35,750
Do you like me?

1293
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:39,125
What kind of question is this?

1294
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:42,000
If a kid asks his mother...

1295
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,667
she can't reply

1296
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:46,708
Come on, tell me

1297
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,375
I'm nothing without you

1298
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,875
Without you, I would have been dead

1299
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,708
Are you insane?

1300
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:01,375
-Hang up the phone
-I was wondering why the delay?

1301
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:06,542
I'm sorry. It just came out in a flow

1302
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:07,833
Disconnect the call

1303
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:12,833
1-liter packets were out of stock.
So I bought half-liter packets

1304
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:13,833
Doesn't matter

1305
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,875
-What are you preparing?
-Take your hands off

1306
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,167
It's for her. She would be
very hungry when she comes

1307
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:20,250
-Hence...
-Wow!

1308
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:23,250
-Showering so much love for the daughter?
-Of course

1309
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,958
-Are you hungry?
-Yes

1310
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:27,333
I'll make a coffee. It will
take care of your hunger

1311
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,917
-Now, you go
-Fine

1312
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:30,083
(Humming a song)

1313
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:48,958
I didn't find any evidence from
all 4 bodies to prove the murder

1314
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:55,875
cadaveric plasma and rigor
mortis onset doesn't show a clue

1315
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,000
Before another gets killed... No!

1316
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:12,000
Couldn't find any traces
of injection or body mark

1317
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,542
I have missed it despite
working meticulously

1318
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:03,000
'I shouldn't have taken
this decision, mom'

1319
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,167
'But I have no clue what else to do'

1320
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:07,292
'You had pampered me so well'

1321
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,208
'But I wanted to become a cop'

1322
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:13,083
'six months of training went well'

1323
01:26:13,917 --> 01:26:15,333
'Mr.Dharmalingam...'

1324
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:16,792
'Head constable Nirmala'

1325
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:18,708
'and other treated me well'

1326
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:21,583
'They helped me get through these times'

1327
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:22,792
'But today...'

1328
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:32,875
I was taken for a bandobast
in a protesting zone

1329
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:36,000
It's the third of my period

1330
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,375
I didn't sleep last night

1331
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,542
I was having severe
pain in the lower abdomen

1332
01:26:41,375 --> 01:26:44,875
I was having a severe headache
because of the sleepless night

1333
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,583
I resumed my duty with the pain

1334
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,125
It was hurting bad

1335
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,292
I didn't have my breakfast

1336
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,125
I was so tired...

1337
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:58,417
'and requested a 20
minutes break from the SI'

1338
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:02,875
But he took advantage of this situation
and he avenged me for a previous incident

1339
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,875
and denied me the permission

1340
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:08,000
Why did you choose this job
if you can't do it right?

1341
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,667
and he verbally abused me

1342
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,083
I don't mind him abusing me...

1343
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,417
he also dragged you into it

1344
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:30,208
'I know..."

1345
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,292
'ending life is not the solution'

1346
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,417
'But I'm not able to
digest this embarrassment'

1347
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:39,500
'Grandma...'

1348
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:40,667
'Bujjima...'

1349
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:41,750
'Brother Siva...'

1350
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:43,167
'Convey my regards'

1351
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:45,833
'For one last time...

1352
01:27:45,917 --> 01:27:51,333
'I would like to see you and dad'

1353
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:04,333
'I'm leaving, mom'

1354
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,292
(caller tuner playing)

1355
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,667
Hello is it Miss.Tamil Mani?

1356
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:45,208
-Yes?
-I'm calling from Pathway Fibrenet...

1357
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:47,750
Can I take 2 minutes of
your time? Are you free?

1358
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:53,542
-Yes
-You have been using the 942 plan until now

1359
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:55,708
-Rs.1099 including taxes
-Hello...

1360
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:57,875
I don't need any plans

1361
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,958
Concerned people will
disconnect the connection

1362
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,417
Your voice isn't clear

1363
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:07,208
Not a problem.. you can hang up

1364
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,167
Can I talk for 2 minutes? Please...

1365
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:14,667
Oh God!

1366
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:20,667
Not just this month... but you
need to pay 740 inclusive of taxes

1367
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:24,750
We have not offered this
to any other customer...

1368
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,667
you are the first

1369
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:31,458
This a life time opportunity

1370
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,042
Please give it a thought

1371
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:56,167
Tell me

1372
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:59,500
Shall I renew the offer, madam?

1373
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:17,792
I'll do it

1374
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,708
You are rocking

1375
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,583
Dear...

1376
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,833
I did ask you not to
cry in Meenu's presence

1377
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,708
You are so naive

1378
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,167
I did warn him...

1379
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,333
not to get loan...

1380
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:50,250
The loan we get must with in our limits

1381
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:54,125
He got a loan for meeting his luxurious needs
and committed suicide fearing the lenders

1382
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,000
I can't digest this

1383
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,417
Don't cry

1384
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:04,250
I've lost everything

1385
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,375
I hate my brother

1386
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:10,250
Why are you mourning for the
one who didn't bother about you?

1387
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,958
Don't cry

1388
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:16,958
We must live a better
life at least for Meenu

1389
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:19,625
Everything is ready.

1390
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:22,958
Come here, Meenu

1391
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:30,875
Here you go

1392
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,333
(caller tuner playing)

1393
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,750
Is it Mr. Vasanth?

1394
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,583
It's his wife

1395
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:23,458
-I'm sorry. Can I talk for 2 minutes?
-Yes

1396
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:26,333
This is Nandhini from Pathway

1397
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,750
He is yet to renew his
broadband connection

1398
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,958
So this call is to
know the reason for it

1399
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,750
-When can you renew?
-He is no more

1400
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:38,583
-Proceed
-There is an offer...

1401
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,250
You are on 943 plan

1402
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,625
There is a new offer for you.
All you need to pay is 862

1403
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,542
Once you recharge...

1404
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,167
-You get extra data...
-Hold on

1405
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,542
I'm going through a tough phase...

1406
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,167
I can't continue further

1407
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:56,333
It won't be necessary as well

1408
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,292
You can disconnect it

1409
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,625
Please give it a thought

1410
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:04,250
Usually I don't suggest this

1411
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:07,625
I'm telling you this

1412
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:09,292
everyone won't get this offer

1413
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,250
only lucky customers get it

1414
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:14,875
We think you are one of them

1415
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:18,500
Please give it a thought

1416
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:34,333
Are you on the line?

1417
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:36,458
Yeah!

1418
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,500
I'll renew

1419

"Fear not..."

01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,375
"Fortune favors the brave"

1437
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:45,125

-I have done it
-Really?

1452
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:35,917
I have hit the target

1453
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:38,792
I've done it

1454
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:41,542
Hold on. I'm witnessing a miracle

1455
01:35:42,417 --> 01:35:43,833
Superb, Nandhu

1456
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:46,500
-Great
-So, I can see you from tomorrow onwards

1457
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,833
-Feeling good?
-Yup

1458
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,292
-See you tomorrow
-Bye

1459
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:20,583
Talk to me

1460
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:21,750
Why are keeping quiet?

1461
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:24,417
What do you want?

1462
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:27,542
The social media, dailies...

1463
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,375
Physically abusing girls
who don't accept love...

1464
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:35,208
Slaying a girl in a day light...

1465
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:38,583
You share this with others
unless it happens to you

1466
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,167
You gossip about it for a while

1467
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:44,583
You will realize it only
when it happens yo you

1468
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:45,750
Right?

1469
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:47,667
Are you wondering why
am I saying this to you?

1470
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:49,375
Because you are going
to experience it today

1471
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,208
Do you know where am I?

1472
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,875
Right in front of your office

1473
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:00,250
Complain it to the
your parents or cops...

1474
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,208
to anyone for that matter

1475
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,375
At any cost you have to face me

1476
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:04,583
Come fast

1477
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:10,083
'The fear in you...'

1478
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:12,708
'Our weakness is our enemy's strength'

1479
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:15,625
'Hide your fear if you
aren't brave enough...'

1480
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:17,750
'the enemy will step back'

1481
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,667
Make sure that you don't
spoil our reputation

1482
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:23,542
'We live to please others'

1483
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,208
'when are we gonna change?'

1484
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:26,667
'when will we live for ourselves?'

1485
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:30,250
'we are so concerned about
people judging you...'

1486
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:33,833
'that we never think about our self'

1487
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:36,708
'we are living in a magical world...'

1488
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:39,375
'many are yet to realize it'

1489
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:40,500
'Forget it'

1490
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,125
'If you do good...'

1491
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:44,083
'when we are in trouble...'

1492
01:37:44,417 --> 01:37:46,333
'to get out of it...

1493
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:48,708
'we will get an opportunity helping us'

1494
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:51,375
'we have to make sure
that use it wisely'

1495
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:53,750
People will drag into a fight

1496
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,208
Provoke for a physical fight...

1497
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:57,750
You mustn't retaliate. Got it?

1498
01:37:57,875 --> 01:38:01,458
'When Karna tries to
decimate Arjuna in the war...'

1499
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:06,000
'though Karna was a paragon of
virtues and had earned many boons...'

1500
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,792
'Lord Krishna was forced to
uses his trick to kill Karna'

1501
01:38:09,833 --> 01:38:11,042
'karma is a boomerang'

1502
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:15,625
'we need to act to experience something'

1503
01:38:15,833 --> 01:38:18,583
'if we distance our self from
the act, we seldom experience it'

1504
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:21,250
'thus we can't handle anything'

1505
01:39:03,792 --> 01:39:06,750
'6 months later' Why
so much pending cases?

1506
01:39:06,792 --> 01:39:08,708
It's unavoidable when
politics interferes

1507
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:09,958
We mustn't take it for granted

1508
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,708
Did you recognize him?

1509
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,292
-Who is that?
-What do you mean?

1510
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:17,250
Last week a violent clash
happened in Thoothukudi

1511
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:19,375
A week after that I
was talking to him...

1512
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:20,833
he says he got clue of it

1513
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:24,292
I was quite occupied to know this

1514
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:25,625
Who is that?

1515
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:29,000
6 months ago...

1516
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,208
a girl working in a BPO was kidnapped...

1517
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,083
and was raped by 5 men, remember?

1518
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:35,000
He is the prime accused amongst them

1519
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,250
His dad had appealed too?

1520
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:37,250
Yes

1521
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:39,083
He made all his efforts

1522
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:40,750
He is no more now

1523
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,667
He is the prime accused

1524
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:45,292
Stating insufficient evidence
the court released him

1525
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,208
Look at him now... back to his old ways

1526
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:50,583
We are able to identify
them but those poor girls

1527
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:53,250
We, the criminals lawyers
are our self scared of them

1528
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:56,333
She said that she would be coming early

1529
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:59,458
I didn't expect to see her like this

1530
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:01,833
Did you go away...

1531
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:05,458
to reduce my burden?

1532
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,542
But you ended up giving
this unbearable burden

1533
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:14,375
Is there something painful than this?

1534
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,750
My only daughter...

1535
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,917
I pampered her like a queen...

1536
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:22,792
But those morons did this to my girl

1537
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,792
My cutie pie...

1538
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:29,917
Mom...

1539
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,375
You must study well...

1540
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,542
must reach great heights...

1541
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:50,625
you must live a healthy
life till 100 years

1542
01:40:58,292 --> 01:40:59,292
Geetha told...

1543
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:03,583
they give the minced body

1544
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:06,000
Let's go

1545
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:09,583
You aren't the same since
a week. You are in trouble...

1546
01:41:09,917 --> 01:41:12,833
I was too cautious to
keep you away from trouble

1547
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:16,292
But what feared did happen

1548
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,250
They are the girl's parents

1549
01:41:21,292 --> 01:41:22,542
-When did they come?
-Just now

1550
01:41:22,542 --> 01:41:23,500
Let's surrender the body

1551
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,208
Please come

1552
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:26,875
-Excuse me
-Yes, sir?

1553
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:31,667
The bag and ID was
found along with the body

1554
01:41:31,917 --> 01:41:34,125
Handover this to her parents over there

1555
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:35,667
I shall do it

1556
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:38,875
But she didn't disclose anything to me

1557
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:46,083
Were such a bad parents?

1558
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,250
It's you daughter's bag

1559
01:42:01,792 --> 01:42:03,583
-Will you take care?
-I will

1560
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:09,833
This is not my daughter's bag

1561
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,083
What did he say?

1562
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,167
This is not my daughter's bag

1563
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:17,917
This is not my daughter's bag

1564
01:42:24,292 --> 01:42:26,792
Standby... she will be coming soon

1565
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:28,292
Act as soon as she comes out

1566
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:31,250
One of your uncle is an MLA
and another uncle is a cop

1567
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,000
Are you still scared?

1568
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:34,958
Hey dunce...

1569
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:37,167
My mom will create a ruckus
is she learns about it

1570
01:42:37,917 --> 01:42:39,500
So, I want to be on the safer side

1571
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:41,917
Got it? So, zip up

1572
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:45,958
She has come out

1573
01:42:46,167 --> 01:42:47,417
He says she is here

1574
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:48,875
-Who?
-Which one?

1575
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,500
The one wearing the
combination of blue and red

1576
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:52,958
-Who?
-one wearing blue and red

1577
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:00,875
Start the car and stand by...

1578
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:02,375
start once I give the nod

1579
01:43:02,792 --> 01:43:07,083
Hello madam... what
happened? I'm talking to you

1580
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,458
She is approaching

1581
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:12,583
Careful...

1582
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,458
Snatch

1583
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,375
-Let me go
-She is not the girl

1584
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:22,708
-Not this one?
-one wearing blue and red

1585
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:30,125
-Get in
-Let me go

1586
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:32,167
Don't let her go Move

1587
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:37,083
Leave her

1588
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:39,958
-Leave her
-It's okay... push her

1589
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,167
Let's take her

1590
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:50,750
Go... go

1591
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,250
-Let her go
-Stop the car... I said stop

1592
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:59,625
I said leave her... Leave her

1593
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:02,667
-Get in
-Hold on

1594
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:04,833
Move on!

1595
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:07,250
You will be totally wasted

1596
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:13,917
Stop...

1597
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,667
2 girls have been kidnapped

1598
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,042
-Is it Nandhini's mom?
-Yes?

1599
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:30,542
Your daughter has been
kidnapped near the office

1600
01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:33,125
What happened?

1601
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,167
Dug your own grave

1602
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,458
Yashika from Pathway Fibrenet...

1603
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,458
Let me go

1604
01:45:03,333 --> 01:45:05,292
-Come on
-Go, catch her

1605
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:08,667
Don't let her escape.
She will spoil our plans

1606
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:12,750
What the hell are you doing? Come on

1607
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:24,250
'When we are in trouble...'

1608
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,083
'to get out of it...

1609
01:45:26,292 --> 01:45:28,833
'we will get an opportunity
to help our self'

1610
01:45:29,042 --> 01:45:30,750
'we have to use it wisely'

1611
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,458
I'll trace the number you gave

1612
01:45:43,708 --> 01:45:47,250
If I get any information,
I'll contact you immediately

1613
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:53,083
Madam, I've to make an emergency
call. Can I've your phone?

1614
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,042
Sure

1615
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:00,250
Thanks

1616
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,958
If you get a call from this number...

1617
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:04,375
-tell them 'your daughter is safe'
-Alright

1618
01:46:18,875 --> 01:46:20,875
What about the chopped limbs?

1619
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:23,042
Just throw it away...
Let animals feed on it

1620
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:35,292
-Did you inquire her friends?
-I have inquired everyone

1621
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:37,708
She didn't reveal anything

1622
01:46:38,417 --> 01:46:40,083
You didn't think much about it

1623
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:44,375
The call from an anonymous person...
Did you ask them to inquire about it?

1624
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,208
They said they will be
tracing the number tomorrow

1625
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,375
Don't worry. Pass the
phone to my colleague

1626
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:52,292
-I will
-Not sure who would have done it

1627
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:58,542
Do you want me to come there?

1628
01:46:58,542 --> 01:47:00,708
-Not needed
-Do you want any help?

1629
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,125
No need

1630
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:03,833
Yazhini is here as well. I'll take care

1631
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:05,583
-Call me if you need anything
-Okay. Thanks

1632
01:47:06,792 --> 01:47:10,542
-Lakshmi. don't worry. She will be safe
-I'll leave.Take care

1633
01:47:10,792 --> 01:47:13,417
-Do inquire your friends once again
-Sure

1634
01:47:14,625 --> 01:47:16,792
-Are you Nandhini's parents?
-Yes, we are

1635
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,750
-I've been trying umpteen times. Cant' you pick it?
-My phone is broke

1636
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:21,583
Please don't mistake us

1637
01:47:22,042 --> 01:47:24,000
-Where is our daughter?
-Any info?

1638
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:27,125
-You both must start immediately to Andhra?
-Andhra?

1639
01:47:27,333 --> 01:47:28,083
What?

1640
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:30,458
This is not my daughter's bag

1641
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:42,458
-This is the place. Thanks
-Welcome

1642
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:47,750
-Where is my mom?
-We were looking for you

1643
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,917
-Looking For me?
-Yes, your parents went to Andhra looking for you

1644
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:51,583
-To Andhra?
-Yeah

1645
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,875
Did I do something wrong?

1646
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:53,958
-How are you?
-Good

1647
01:48:54,292 --> 01:48:58,542
Why did you ask me to meet you?
Especially in a place like this?

1648
01:48:58,792 --> 01:49:00,708
I've some doubts in Chemistry...

1649
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,417
So, I wanted to get
clarified it from you

1650
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:04,083
What do you mean?

1651
01:49:04,333 --> 01:49:07,917
It we who clarify our doubts with
you when visit us a a guest lecturer

1652
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,083
This is quite surprising

1653
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,417
Nandhini...

1654
01:49:13,708 --> 01:49:15,333
Nerve gas...

1655
01:49:15,542 --> 01:49:16,500
Insulin...

1656
01:49:16,542 --> 01:49:17,500
Arsenic...

1657
01:49:17,792 --> 01:49:18,917
Three days ago you wanted some
clarifications on these subjects...

1658
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:23,000
Yes... Succinylcholine...
Any idea of these stuff?

1659
01:49:24,667 --> 01:49:25,625
No, madam

1660
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:38,125
Karthi, Ram, Manoj, Selva...

1661
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:41,792
Have your heard about them?

1662
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:44,583
It was published in the news too

1663
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:48,208
A series of murders made
too look like natural deaths

1664
01:49:48,667 --> 01:49:50,833
Why are you are perspiring? Wipe it off

1665
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:54,167
Post postmortem report...

1666
01:49:54,292 --> 01:49:55,250
Forensic department...

1667
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:56,375
Finger print technicians...

1668
01:49:56,458 --> 01:49:57,500
Narcotics...

1669
01:49:57,625 --> 01:50:00,208
Perfectly executed murders
with no evidence whatsoever

1670
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:05,167
I will not ask you the motive

1671
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:08,125
I know you are a good girl

1672
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,292
But, please stop this

1673
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,917
Your parents have none but you

1674
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:17,458
Today I'm alive and talking to you

1675
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:18,917
thanks to...

1676
01:50:20,917 --> 01:50:22,292
Where is my daughter?

1677
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,667
Are you Yashika's dad?

1678
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:26,833
-Yes
-I'm sorry, sir... your daughter...

1679
01:50:27,333 --> 01:50:28,292
is no more

1680
01:50:34,042 --> 01:50:37,625
I'm responsible for
your daughter's death

1681
01:50:38,917 --> 01:50:41,208
Her death left a deep scar on him

1682
01:50:41,458 --> 01:50:43,417
It increased my guilt

1683
01:50:43,708 --> 01:50:45,292
The culprits went Scot free...

1684
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:49,792
we channeled our anger
to kill the five men

1685
01:50:50,125 --> 01:50:54,208
We wanted to make sure that those
murders doesn't lead the cops to us

1686
01:50:54,458 --> 01:50:58,500
We waited till the time favoured us
to make them look like natural death

1687
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:00,458
We followed them for 6 months

1688
01:51:00,917 --> 01:51:03,083
Your seminar rung the bell

1689
01:51:03,292 --> 01:51:05,708
In 1938, during the Word War II...

1690
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:08,292
Tokyo Subway attack in 1995...

1691
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:10,375
2013 Syrian civil war...

1692
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:12,917
You had mentioned that in all those
incidents nerve agents were used

1693
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:14,583
I researched on the same...

1694
01:51:14,667 --> 01:51:17,000
Even in 2017...

1695
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:20,750
**** executed his brother's murder...

1696
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:23,292
in the international airport
of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia...

1697
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:24,583
In the presence of public...

1698
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:27,292
without raising any
suspicion, he was targeted...

1699
01:51:27,417 --> 01:51:30,125
and killed using nerve agents

1700
01:51:30,167 --> 01:51:32,083
Sarin, Tabun, soman, VX ...

1701
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:34,750
I learnt that these were available

1702
01:51:34,958 --> 01:51:38,292
The volatile VX nerve
agent was titrated...

1703
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:41,250
and filled in a pressurized container...

1704
01:51:41,292 --> 01:51:42,125
and sprayed it

1705
01:51:42,167 --> 01:51:44,042
It reaches his lungs...

1706
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:48,167
mixes up with the blood...cholinergic
effect disrupts the nervous system

1707
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:50,500
and the consequent
convulsions killed him

1708
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,958
It's a untraceable method

1709
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:55,542
That was rightly called the weapon of
mass destruction... I witnessed it then

1710
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:59,458
In olden times, the king's food
was poisoned with arsenic...

1711
01:51:59,625 --> 01:52:01,083
and the murder was created like a
natural death... we mimicked that...

1712
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:02,625
in our next murder

1713
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:06,833
As expected, he isolated himself in
the sea mourning his friend's death

1714
01:52:06,833 --> 01:52:09,958
We stuffed high concentric
arsenic into a fish and fed him

1715
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:14,500
as soon as he consumed it, the chemical
reaction affected all 200 enzymes...

1716
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,208
it generated unwanted
'Reactive oxygen species' cells

1717
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:21,375
as a result it destroys heart,
Mitochondria and other cells...

1718
01:52:21,458 --> 01:52:23,167
then he fell into the sea
and had a painful death

1719
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:26,500
Then I realised why Arsenic
is called 'the king of poison'

1720
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,167
We found that one of
them was a drug addict

1721
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:34,750
Afrezza, an inhalation form of insulin,
generally used for medication purpose...

1722
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:37,958
we gave him the overdose of this drug
in the name of an imported cocaine

1723
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:40,458
we made him use it at the right time

1724
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:42,583
Since his was a drug affected body...

1725
01:52:42,583 --> 01:52:44,500
his sugar levels fell rapidly...

1726
01:52:44,583 --> 01:52:47,417
cells stopped functioning and then brain
stopped functioning resulting in death

1727
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:51,000
We had planned to use
Succinylcholine for the next murder

1728
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:53,625
as it blocks neuro muscular junction....

1729
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:57,458
it will look like an heart attack. So we
induced the accident and injected to him

1730
01:52:57,458 --> 01:52:59,875
As soon Succinylcholine
gets mixed in his blood...

1731
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:00,833
it affects the nervous system...

1732
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:03,250
it acts at the junction where
nerves meet the muscles...

1733
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:06,833
the muscles stop functioning, hence lungs
and heart stop functioning, ultimately he died

1734
01:53:07,083 --> 01:53:11,417
We had drafted a pukka plan
to finish off Vinoth today...

1735
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,292
As Yashika's dad couldn't
control when he faced him...

1736
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:18,833
it alerted Vinoth and
killed right in-front of me

1737
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:22,667
I could do nothing

1738
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:26,750
I used to get scared of even a lizard...

1739
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:31,333
I never imagined that...

1740
01:53:32,542 --> 01:53:33,500
I would end up as a murderer

1741
01:53:34,917 --> 01:53:36,125
Cool, Nandhini

1742
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,708
Relax, Nandhini

1743
01:53:41,583 --> 01:53:42,833
You haven't killed anyone...

1744
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:46,208
A father who couldn't get justice
for her deceased daughter...

1745
01:53:46,458 --> 01:53:49,792
tried to avenge her death

1746
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,958
You have just helped him

1747
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,708
That's it

1748
01:53:55,917 --> 01:53:57,708
Anyone in his place
would have done the same

1749
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:02,042
But, how did you infer it?

1750
01:54:02,292 --> 01:54:05,167
The first murder didn't ring any bell

1751
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:10,667
But I found an injection
mark in the fourth murder

1752
01:54:11,167 --> 01:54:12,833
that was doubtful

1753
01:54:13,208 --> 01:54:15,458
I suspected that he
would be an drug addict

1754
01:54:15,667 --> 01:54:19,083
On investigation, we found
that he doesn't use drugs

1755
01:54:19,958 --> 01:54:22,208
If it had been a murder...

1756
01:54:22,667 --> 01:54:25,333
this can be accomplished
only by a technical expert

1757
01:54:25,542 --> 01:54:26,750
That was the spark

1758
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:30,833
Because, gas form, liquid
form, powder, acidic...

1759
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:33,958
every murder had one form or the other

1760
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:35,917
Not just that...

1761
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:41,500
I noticed that the murders happened in
the same way that I taught in the seminar

1762
01:54:43,333 --> 01:54:45,250
The things I taught theoretically...

1763
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:48,500
one of my student...

1764
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,208
I sensed that he must be
practically experimenting it

1765
01:54:53,458 --> 01:54:55,583
But your name didn't come up even then

1766
01:54:57,208 --> 01:54:59,625
The technique you were about
to use for the fourth murder...

1767
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:02,792
do you remember, you had called me
over the phone to clarify on the same?

1768
01:55:07,625 --> 01:55:10,375
The next day, a death
in the same concept

1769
01:55:10,917 --> 01:55:13,292
In that particular murder I inferred it

1770
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:17,625
-You are genius, madam
-Me?

1771
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:21,292
Reach home safely and text me

1772
01:55:21,583 --> 01:55:22,542
Ok, madam

1773
01:55:26,292 --> 01:55:27,750
-I shall give it
-I'll give it to madam

1774
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,917
-I'll give it
-No, I will

1775
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,958
No!

1776
01:55:31,042 --> 01:55:33,000
(Speaking gibberish)

1777
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,667
'Get lost, yak' Is that right?

1778
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,750
How did you find it?

1779
01:55:38,083 --> 01:55:41,083
It's the Tamil gibberish version of
the actual word. It's not that difficult

1780
01:55:41,083 --> 01:55:41,125
Good. Still, I'll give it.

1781
01:55:41,125 --> 01:55:42,333
-I shall give it
-I'll give it to madam

1782
01:55:42,375 --> 01:55:43,875
I will bite your hand

1783
01:55:43,875 --> 01:55:45,458
You need trouble
yourself. I will give it.

1784
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:53,167
My mom often say this...

1785
01:55:53,292 --> 01:55:55,542
I've been a lucky
mascot since I was a kid

1786
01:55:55,958 --> 01:55:59,625
If I attend a feast or gift someone...

1787
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:01,792
If I like someone and talk to them...

1788
01:56:01,958 --> 01:56:03,958
their fortunes turn good

1789
01:56:04,417 --> 01:56:07,083
Many have benefited this way

1790
01:56:07,292 --> 01:56:08,292
just like their intention

1791
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:14,292
" O' women, you will rise from the dark"

1792
01:56:18,083 --> 01:56:20,292
"Look at your son"

1793
01:56:20,417 --> 01:56:21,250
Mani...mom is here

1794
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:26,042
"You have an undaunted heart"

1795
01:56:26,292 --> 01:56:31,083
"No more tears... it's
the time to taste success"

1796
01:56:31,625 --> 01:56:37,292
"The world will fall at your feet"

1797
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:40,417
"The times are in your favour"

1798
01:56:40,417 --> 01:56:42,833
"It's time to reign"

1799
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:45,750
"Time to get over your sufferings"

1800
01:56:45,917 --> 01:56:49,083
"Time to wear a smile on your face"

1801
01:56:49,458 --> 01:56:53,875
Someone called Nandhini
had contacted me on Facebook

1802
01:56:54,292 --> 01:56:59,417
"Unpredictability makes
life more aesthetic"

1803
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:02,917
-You had registered for an organ transplant for your wife?
-Yes, I did

1804
01:57:03,208 --> 01:57:05,542
The organ is available.
Please come here within 3 hours

1805
01:57:10,583 --> 01:57:13,708
-We are your husband's colleagues
-Please get in

1806
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:15,625
As your husband has passed away...

1807
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:18,250
we have planned to pass the job to you

1808
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:19,292
Thank you very much

1809
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:22,125
We have collected some cash from the
office. It will be helpful for your kid

1810
01:57:22,125 --> 01:57:26,667
No need. The job you
guaranteed is more than enough

1811
01:57:30,667 --> 01:57:32,917
Sir, please get me off the hook

1812
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:35,083
What's this?

1813
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:36,417
Don't worry

1814
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:41,292
I have freed countless men in my career

1815
01:57:42,042 --> 01:57:43,458
You need not insist

1816
01:57:45,292 --> 01:57:48,042
Smoke a puff

1817
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:56,917
This will cool you off

1818
01:57:57,167 --> 01:57:58,125
Got a lighter?

1819
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:08,917
We must not blame the society

1820
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:11,542
We must put our kids on the right path

1821
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:12,917
-Greetings, sir
-Greetings... how are you?

1822
01:58:12,917 --> 01:58:14,708
-Good
-What about the section 302 case?

1823
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:15,917
-He was convicted
-Okay

1824
01:58:16,292 --> 01:58:17,250
It's my phone

1825
01:58:18,042 --> 01:58:19,208
Please go ahead

1826
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,833
Tell me

1827
01:58:23,292 --> 01:58:24,500
I've reached the office

1828
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:26,417
Good

1829
01:58:26,917 --> 01:58:28,333
I've reached the court

1830
01:58:28,583 --> 01:58:30,042
-Okay, dad
-Fine, dear

1831
01:58:30,625 --> 01:58:34,417
Call me when you done
and I shall pick you up

1832
01:58:34,417 --> 01:58:35,375
Okay, dad

1833
01:58:35,917 --> 01:58:37,958
Just repeat my statement in the court

1834
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:47,333
-What's the noise about?
-Someone fell down

1835
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:49,708
-Okay, I'll disconnect
-Okay, dad

1836
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:53,542
Who is he?

1837
01:58:53,792 --> 01:58:55,042
The accused

1838
01:58:59,083 --> 01:59:00,500
It's done

1839
01:59:06,042 --> 01:59:08,917
Not like that. Hold the tip

1840
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:11,083
Even if you leave an impression...

1841
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:14,458
it will vanish when lights it.
So that there would be no evidence

1842
01:59:14,542 --> 01:59:15,500
There you go

1843
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:20,917
Have you forgiven me?

1844
01:59:36,208 --> 01:59:38,000
You got into a closer relationship...

1845
01:59:38,125 --> 01:59:39,417
and then blocked my number

1846
01:59:39,417 --> 01:59:42,333
I'm forced to call
from a different number

1847
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:43,792
My friends did warn me

1848
01:59:44,083 --> 01:59:45,917
not to trust you

1849
01:59:46,167 --> 01:59:48,333
I was genuinely in love with you

1850
01:59:48,542 --> 01:59:50,958
In the end, you proved them right

1851
01:59:51,583 --> 01:59:53,375
'Do you know where am I?'

1852
01:59:53,583 --> 01:59:56,250
'Outside your office'

1853
01:59:56,542 --> 02:00:00,667
'I dare you to escape from my sight'

1854
02:00:08,083 --> 02:00:12,333
-'I mixed it in the milk'
-'Is he dead?'

1855
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:16,167
'5 of us escaped from the place'

1856
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:19,000
-'The first customer who came out...'
-'Who did it?'

1857
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:20,458
-Not sure'

1858
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:23,375
-Will your husband come?'
-'I'm not sure'

1859
02:00:23,583 --> 02:00:25,750
'Come to the place tomorrow
morning and we shall elope'

1860
02:00:26,417 --> 02:00:29,833
'The officials are manipulating'

1861
02:00:29,833 --> 02:00:33,417
'He has impregnated the
girl who met him for a favor'

1862
02:00:33,708 --> 02:00:35,583
'Call me once you reach the major road'

1863
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:38,292
'CALLS'

1864
02:00:48,792 --> 02:00:51,583
Greetings and welcome to 'Chennai 360;

1865
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:54,125
What's the solution
to harassment of women?

1866
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:58,708
Let's go to the public
and hear it from them

1867
02:00:58,833 --> 02:00:59,708
Madam please tell us...

1868
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:01,917
What's the solution
to harassment of women?

1869
02:01:02,833 --> 02:01:06,583
-The answers to our questions...
-Hey Nandhini

1870
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:08,542
-What are you doing here?
-Excuse me

1871
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,167
-Who are these people?
-They were looking for bytes

1872
02:01:11,417 --> 02:01:12,875
-How are you?
-Good

1873
02:01:13,083 --> 02:01:14,875
-It's been a while
-How are your parents?

1874
02:01:14,958 --> 02:01:16,708
They are good

1875
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:20,042
-Guess you are too occupied after your promotion
-Not really

1876
02:01:21,875 --> 02:01:22,833
What happened?

1877
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,583
I did ask you to be
careful while playing

1878
02:01:26,042 --> 02:01:28,208
-What's your name?
-V.Meenakshi

1879
02:01:29,708 --> 02:01:31,833
Your voice seems to be familiar

1880
02:01:31,958 --> 02:01:33,458
Not sure

1881
02:01:34,125 --> 02:01:34,583
Fine

1882
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,208
What's the solution
to harassment of women?

1883
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:54,625
At most of the times...

1884
02:01:54,875 --> 02:01:56,542
we don't get the answers
for our question...

1885
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,958
at the right time

1886
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:01,417
Some get into trouble
because of ignorance

1887
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:03,500
but many get trapped
because of their greediness

1888
02:02:05,917 --> 02:02:08,542
You can't find a solution somewhere else

1889
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,958
It's within us

1890
02:02:11,292 --> 02:02:16,958
It's we who decide how
men should behave with us'

1891
02:02:18,375 --> 02:02:21,500
I was once lost in the dark

1892
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:22,958
I've been recently
brought myself to the light

1893
02:02:23,417 --> 02:02:24,750
Why can't others do it too?

1894
02:02:25,208 --> 02:02:29,042
Our forefathers have preserved
this earth with a great difficulty

1895
02:02:29,458 --> 02:02:34,083
But the next generation of people
are least bothered about anything

1896
02:02:34,167 --> 02:02:36,958
and spoiling it as much as we can

1897
02:02:37,333 --> 02:02:39,625
But, one fine day everything will change

1898
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:42,250
Because...

1899
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,667
I still have faith in men

1900
02:02:45,375 --> 02:02:46,333
A change in individual...

1901
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:49,208
this is the solution for everything

1902
02:02:51,417 --> 02:02:54,542
Nature destroys human sins

1903
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,792
People lead a pressurized life

1904
02:02:59,792 --> 02:03:00,750
Meditate...

1905
02:03:00,792 --> 02:03:02,417
Yoga doesn't subside anger

1906
02:03:02,417 --> 02:03:03,875
Women dress inappropriately...

1907
02:03:03,875 --> 02:03:05,042
obviously men will

1908
02:03:05,292 --> 02:03:06,250
harass them

1909
02:03:06,292 --> 02:03:08,000
these are very serious
allegations on women

1910
02:03:08,125 --> 02:03:09,625
They want us to stay at home forever

1911
02:03:09,833 --> 02:03:11,042
and nitpick on us when
we are free-spirited

1912
02:03:11,042 --> 02:03:12,000
Let them learn through experience

1913
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:13,333
It's rightly said that

1914
02:03:13,375 --> 02:03:15,375
A woman who can't be tamed in the
house can be tamed by the society

1915
02:03:15,375 --> 02:03:18,250
Don't we have the rights to
reject a proposal from a boy?

1916
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:19,708
Will they kill us if we reject it?

1917
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:22,083
We are scared for her since her birth

1918
02:03:22,292 --> 02:03:24,708
'How to raise her and
safeguard in this society?'

1919
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,417
A 10 year girl is pregnant

1920
02:03:26,667 --> 02:03:28,083
My friend was raped and murdered

1921
02:03:28,333 --> 02:03:29,542
They even become Zoophiliac

1922
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,750
Boys can't be monitored

1923
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:38,292
An adult content video hits
a million views with an hour

1924
02:03:38,333 --> 02:03:41,250
Married women are posting their
extra marital videos on social media

1925
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:42,667
Instant death punishment...

1926
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:44,667
People have no time for their family...

1927
02:03:44,917 --> 02:03:46,750
2K kids are the reason for such things

1928
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:48,917
You will have to suffer
the curse of 90's kids

1929
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:50,583
I'm proud to be a 'abstinent single'

1930
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:53,000
-Your opinion?
-Scoot...

1931
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:54,250
Jobless people...

1932
02:04:02,292 --> 02:04:03,250
Jobless people...
