2
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,343
We could've got this
stuff from anyone.

3
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,776
But your life can be
taken from you only.

4
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,283
That's why we trapped you.

5
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,177
Billa.

6
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,951
lndia, Russia, UAE,
Thailand, Malaysia.

7
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,955
Police of more than 1 1 countries have
lost their sleep because of him.

8
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,953
With Malaysia as the base,

9
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,791
he deals with drugs,
weapons export, bomb blasts.

10
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,463
He is one of the
international courier of crime

11
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,465
and is into many such illegal activities.

12
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,068
We tried many times
but couldn't catch him.

13
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,238
He keeps dodging us everytime.

14
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,881
Even God would've appeared
if we had chanted his name.

15
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,382
Ranjith, he is next to Billa.

16
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:58,062
For the past 2 years l & my informers
have left our country & family,

17
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,832
and have tried a lot to catch him
and break his network.

18
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,169
But he knows about us
even better.

19
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,031
We will have full support
from the Malaysian police.

20
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,144
Yes Janaki.

21
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,042
The prayer is over.

22
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,375
Listen to the bell sound,
chant the God's name & pray.

23
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,714
Oh God!

24
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,614
ls it necessary?

25
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,550
Don't say ''Oh God!''
Say O my Lord Rama!

26
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,727
O my Lord Rama!
- Eat on time.

27
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,895
Andhra meals not burgers & pizzas.
- l will talk to him.

28
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,228
Mother will make you cook on phone also.
- Yes.

29
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:04,960
Give it to me.

30
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,834
My sister has got an alliance.
Next month is her marriage.

31
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,507
You're the eldest son-in-law,
you must look after everything.

32
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,738
l'm offering special prayers
to Lord Rama in Bhadrachalam.

33
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,250
On my behalf,
seek a boon from Lord Rama.

34
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,078
A boon that l must catch
the evil Ravana known as Billa.

35
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,757
Who is Billa?
l know Ravana.

36
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,585
What's your personal opinion about Billa?

37
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,593
l like him very much.

38
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,528
He was born somewhere in Andhra,
grew up as an orphan,

39
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,102
and has become
a Don of crime world.

40
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,530
The truth is,

41
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,932
if he isn't there, policemen of
1 1 countries would've no work.

42
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,941
l'll catch him soon.

43
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,949
But we must be careful.

44
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,778
Because Billa makes fear to panic.

45
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,014
Can l talk now?
- What's the matter?

46
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,681
Can we meet somewhere?
- No. l can't come now.

47
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,852
There is a man who commands Billa.

48
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,353
Who?
- Devil.

49
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,525
Devil? This name is not in our list.
Where is he?

50
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,355
l don't know where he is and
how he looks like.

51
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,862
He talks to Billa and
Ranjith on phone only.

52
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,863
They are planning something big.

53
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,195
One more important matter.

54
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,372
There is a computer in Billa's
personal chamber.

55
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,033
lt contains details of their plans
and details of his entire network.

56
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,876
Can you crack the code and
send me the details?

57
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,941
lt's not so easy.
That computer has a password.

58
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,880
Only Billa & Ranjith know that password.

59
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,452
l came to know about
the contents of it.

60
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,555
So, l've saved it in a memory card.

61
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,558
Send it fast.
- Rest in person.

62
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,056
Devil...!

63
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,728
This guy must be inspired
by the old movies.

64
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,441
Billa shouldn't ever miss the target.

65
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,782
Similarly, Billa should never
become anyone's target.

66
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,456
But for the first time,
police have targeted me.

67
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,727
Billa, will meet you tomorrow.

68
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,342
He was my trusted informer.
Billa has killed him too.

69
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,841
How did Billa know about him?

70
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,018
There is a mole in our department.

71
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,457
He must've got sold for money.

72
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,694
lt's a nice watch.

73
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,198
Timex...?

74
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,807
No sir. Rolex.
- Rolex...?

75
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,469
Must be very costly?

76
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,045
You get Rs.20000 less than me.

77
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,214
lt was a gift.
- Gift?

78
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,216
ls it worth Rs.1 lakh?
- Rs.5 lakhs.

79
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,053
lt seems there will be seven people
like you in this world,

80
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,225
But in this country,
everyone look the same.

81
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,163
Ranatunga...
- Coming.

82
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,390
Come here.
- Boss, he ate our upma last time.

83
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,399
He likes it very much.
He ordered Upma for 100 people.

84
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,401
You're feeling as if you're
going to cook now.

85
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,574
Yesterday's upma is in the fridge.
Heat it & serve.

86
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,747
Greetings ACP sir.

87
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,247
How are you?

88
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,811
How are you Shankar?
- Fine sir, with your grace.

89
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,385
lt's been nearly a week
since you came here.

90
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,021
What would you like to have?
- Grass.

91
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,183
Grass...?

92
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,760
We go from pillar to post
to catch one man.

93
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,263
But to eat Bajji or to have lunch,
yours is the only place in Kualalumpur.

94
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,797
Your mercy sir. Bring hot idlis
and fresh sambar for him.

95
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,443
Apart from the small gangs,
nothing big.

96
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,373
What's the name you said now?
- Billa.

97
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,275
l couldn't get his details.
- He will get caught.

98
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,442
By God's grace, he'll be caught.

99
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,970
Do you need a weapon even here?

100
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,704
l use weapon & woman the same way.

101
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,311
There is risk & kick while using both.

102
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,487
Risk...?

103
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,322
l'll sacrifice my life for you, know that?

104
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,422
Please...

105
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,757
Do you trust me now?

106
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,930
You're still alive because
l always trust you.

107
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,201
l trust people but not
the beast inside them.

108
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,806
These are our passport & tickets.

109
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,742
The flight is at 2 O'clock tomorrow night.
Come here an hour before.

110
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,077
l'll come there directly, okay?
- Why can't we go together?

111
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,350
Joining Billa's gang was tough.
Leaving his gang is even tougher.

112
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,753
Even if they know that
l'm leaving them...

113
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,362
Don't even try to call me.

114
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,764
Will you come?

115
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,959
l've information that
Vikram is leaving us.

116
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,794
Let him go.

117
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,634
Let him go?

118
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,031
Do you know the reason
why he is leaving?

119
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,140
How could you send him,
let the reason be anything?

120
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,208
Let him tell me the reason first.
Then l'll decide where to send him.

121
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,744
There is one language everyone
in this world understands.

122
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,748
Vikram, we were together
for 7 years.

123
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,240
Why this decision all of a sudden?

124
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,346
Love, escape.

125
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,245
Once you've decided to leave,
nobody can stop you.

126
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,253
l thought of telling you this on phone.

127
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,227
No...only Billa.

128
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,973
Billa, l want your help.

129
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,972
lt's something only you can do it.

130
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,687
l'm a statue of Ellora...
...coming for you...

131
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,198
l'll give you a feast
of my beauty...

132
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,773
l like your power
which stunned me...

133
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,383
Your arrogance sparked
the flame of lust in me...

134
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,885
So, like a lightning,
l spun a net on you...

135
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,890
Fall on me like a thunder...

136
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:54,555
lt's madness...
l want you...

137
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,258
Shall l lay the trap for you?
l swear on you...

138
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,402
Shall l tie myself to you?

139
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:46,612
You might rule the world,
but shall l throw a challenge at you?

140
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:55,783
l'm the hunting deer...
Shall l trap the lion?

141
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:02,957
l'll use my beauty to target you...
l'll sacrifice my beauty for you...

142
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:10,631
You're the man my heart yearns...
l'm a snake with vengeance...

143
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:06,457
My heart is waiting for you...
Embrace happiness...

144
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:11,193
My desires are crossing the limits...

145
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,703
Accept my invitation and
get caught in my beauty...

146
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,536
l'll pour all my beauty on you...

147
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,872
l'll show you heaven on the bed...

148
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,539
For good or bad,
let desires rule our lives...

149
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,551
Let our hot desires
get solaced today...

150
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,572
Billa, come & surrender.

151
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,244
lt's you the police are welcoming.

152
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,982
They are not new to me.

153
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,886
l called them here.

154
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,322
l suspected that when you
gave that meaty shake.

155
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,819
Do you know why?

156
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,325
You have your own reasons.

157
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,670
You killed Vikram who wanted
to share his life with me.

158
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:21,902
For that.

159
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:28,001
Was it you he fell in love with
and tried to run away?

160
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,510
There is not much difference between
death or escaping from Billa.

161
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,182
ls killing people your business?

162
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,761
There are no bullets in it.

163
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:03,040
l don't trust men & women.
But l trust guns & bullets.

164
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,943
You should've removed the gun too.

165
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,337
We're meeting the first time.

166
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,742
You will be with us forever.

167
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,854
You're the best among those who
l've come across.

168
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,149
l've the experience.

169
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,691
The girl's life is at risk.

170
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,198
Priya called me after removing
the bullets from the gun.

171
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,942
You sent a deer to hunt a lion.

172
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,223
lf you point gun & don't fire,
Billa doesn't like that.

173
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,696
Yes sir.

174
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:38,525
l'm sorry to say that you haven't
dealt Billa's case properly.

175
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,139
You couldn't catch him till now.

176
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,708
Your police department can't do it.

177
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,277
May be you need the
help of the lnterpol.

178
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,811
We're handling it better than anyone.

179
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,723
lncrease security to monitor Billa
and his gang members.

180
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,306
Steve, come fast before
police comes here.

181
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,225
Give me the car, briefcase
and run away.

182
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,837
Did you risk so much
for a simple thing?

183
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,661
Join our gang.

184
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,828
She is Maya.
She killed 3 officers infront of me.

185
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,538
She will be useful to us.

186
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,436
She is just not a girl.
She is lady Billa.

187
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,955
l like weapons & women.

188
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,217
You've come to the right place.

189
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,295
What does that mean?

190
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,799
lt means ''good bye'' in Spanish.

191
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,897
You've taken a wise decision
to leave Billa gang.

192
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,955
Billa, ACP Krishnamurthy is
working more for his salary.

193
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,455
He is laying a much bigger trap.

194
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,286
l'm not a small fish
to fall in his net.

195
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,141
Steve gang wants weapons
delivery tomorrow.

196
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,638
He has decided the place & time.

197
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,038
But he wants a container load.

198
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,137
That's too much.

199
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,310
Looks like little risky.
Do we have to accompany you?

200
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,819
Tell him that l will be there on time.

201
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,133
We're going to an important
place tomorrow.

202
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,252
Steve, l think everyone
is new in your gang.

203
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:10,416
l couldn't trust my old men.
- Even you're my old customer.

204
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,101
What's the value of it?

205
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,601
As per your requirements.

206
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,190
Billa, what you spoke has
been recorded.

207
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,129
There is no much difference
between you & them.

208
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,804
You'll know the difference
if you try to escape.

209
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,241
There are around 550 million
illegal weapons around the world.

210
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:09,983
Which means 1 among every
12 people have a weapon.

211
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,985
My business is how to sell weapons
for the remaining 1 1 people.

212
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,652
Do you know how many people
you'd killed in this business?

213
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:19,659
Nothing wrong.

214
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,824
History taught us only one thing.

215
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:26,168
For us to live, we can kill anyone
or any number of people.

216
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,506
You're talking too much.
- l've seen a lot.

217
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,181
Look at your guns.
Very old model.

218
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,849
l'll give you a gift.

219
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,248
You are our gift.

220
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,524
Look at my weapons.

221
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,526
Keep this in your collection
or sell them.

222
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,271
That's yourjob.

223
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,200
Because you're a criminal
and l am a police man.

224
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,537
A little difference.

225
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,713
You need me alive.

226
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,146
But l don't need anyone of you alive.

227
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,158
Leave nothing.

228
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,402
Come Adithya.
Coffee is too good.

229
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:14,906
Take it.

230
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:17,477
Why didn't you come in the morning?

231
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,743
l wasn't feeling well.

232
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,509
The chase here was also upset.

233
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,087
You're co-operating
with Billa very much.

234
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,584
The other day when Billa was taking
that girl as an hostage,

235
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,986
l wanted to gun him down,
but you refused.

236
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,183
And today, you were absent.

237
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:35,426
Take it.

238
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:41,771
ls it necessary now?

239
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:00,883
lsn't his phone working?

240
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,124
Okay.

241
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,452
Have you arrested Billa or not?

242
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,128
We are still searching.

243
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,691
Ask our help if you want.

244
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,137
He is asking if we need any help.

245
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,499
Tell him to send torch lights
to search him.

246
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,645
Sir, that is...

247
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,494
Don't stop the car.

248
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,605
l should put that question to you.

249
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,405
You're wounded.

250
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:07,685
lf a bullet has hit Billa,
it must from be from your gun.

251
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,119
Only you have the guts to gun me.

252
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:14,354
Billa, surrender yourself.
l'll take you to hospital.

253
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:16,699
Tell me, who is Devil?

254
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,434
Turn yourself into approver.

255
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,369
You join hands with me, ACP.

256
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:27,036
Then, who will catch us?
- Try to understand.

257
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,480
Billa, please listen to me.

258
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,718
Look at you.
You're not in good condition.

259
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:47,157
What's wrong with me?
l'm like an emperor.

260
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,292
l'm sitting comfortably
while you're driving the car.

261
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,902
Billa, please listen to me.

262
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,074
When l cried in hunger as a child,
nobody responded.

263
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,338
They gave me nothing.

264
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:06,749
l took it forcibly.

265
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,585
They feared me.

266
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,753
And l kept taking things forcibly.

267
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,080
From then on,

268
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:22,824
l created everyday, every hour, every minute
and every second, and every currency.

269
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,944
Billa, tell me what their plan is.

270
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,384
Who is Devil?
Tell me, Billa.

271
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,289
Good bye.

272
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,061
l thought of reforming you.

273
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,225
Greetings sir.

274
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,593
Why did you call me urgently?

275
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,838
Was he shot in an encounter?
- No. Help me.

276
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,104
Who is he?
- Billa.

277
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,011
Billa?

278
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,247
l used to pray God to catch him.

279
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,586
l planned to catch his
entire network through him.

280
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,017
But...

281
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,524
He is dead now.
Why are you secretly....

282
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:04,133
His gang, his boss & my department
must believe that he is still alive.

283
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,701
They have planned something big.

284
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,539
lf they come to know that Billa is dead,
they will get alerted.

285
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,201
His men are in the police too.

286
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:17,536
He should commit a mistake hoping
that he's alive, and he'll get caught.

287
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:21,206
Can l see Billa's face who
traumatized the police?

288
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:28,224
Ranga!

289
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:33,225
He is my friend Ranga not Billa.

290
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,161
Cutting Ranga.

291
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:36,799
He is from my place Vizag.

292
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,392
He looks exactly like him.

293
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:39,963
What does he do?

294
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:24,843
Stealing is my profession...
lt's troubles...

295
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,848
ln this profession...
Nobody can upstage me...

296
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,785
He's the master thief...

297
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:43,128
O Ranga! You're great!
- You're fantastic!

298
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,502
lf l see it's troubles...
Beware people!

299
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,168
lf he comes,
your valuables go missing...

300
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,598
He'll steal the shine
from your cheeks...

301
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,935
lf you get charmed by him,
you're finished...

302
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,669
You share the birth date
with Phoolan Devi...

303
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,005
You'd be friend of Shobhraj
in your previous birth...

304
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,843
lf coffee is served to you,
cup and saucer go missing...

305
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,019
Purses in the pockets
shiver on seeing you...

306
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,021
Locks open up at your sight...
Safes open on it's own...

307
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,523
O Ranga, you're a King...

308
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:49,529
You're a master thief...
- You're trouble...

309
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:37,069
Women are after you...
They jump walls for you...

310
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,908
They will not mind
if you touch them...

311
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,346
There's no difference
between big and small...

312
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,577
One rupee or hundred rupees
doesn't make any difference...

313
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,086
You take whatever
you lay your hands on...

314
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,485
O Ranga, you're sharp...

315
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:54,592
You're strong...
- You're a thief!

316
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:58,259
What will happen if you're not there?

317
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:02,427
When things request you to lift?
- You take pity to steal...

318
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,766
Once into this world
you got to do something...

319
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,273
l'm doing what l like and
what l'm good at...

320
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,775
For good or bad,
one needs a reputation...

321
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,107
O Ranga, you're an expert...

322
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:17,116
Pick pockets easily...
- Don't think about anything...

323
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:30,393
Safety pin or pistol,
chocolate orjacket...

324
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,264
Broom or fish basket,
arrack sachet or diamond locket...

325
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:42,134
Spoon or grinding stone or Lord Hanuman's
tail, he'll not spare anything...

326
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,478
To hell with these ATM machines.

327
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,481
May the people with
credit cards get diseased!

328
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,656
What happened?
- A big zero.

329
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,223
We've been pick pocketing since morning.
And we haven't even made Rs.1000.

330
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,484
l need to share it with you too.

331
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,760
Carrying credit card in wallets
has become a fashion.

332
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,424
Leave all these.
Let's loot a bank itself.

333
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,999
Who stole it?
- Myself.

334
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,665
You don't know the difference
between gold & fake chains.

335
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,839
Will you loot a bank?

336
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,335
Brother...

337
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,108
Hide it all.
- Brother...

338
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,177
Yes Miss Doctor & Miss Engineer.
What brings you here?- Doctor?

339
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,847
lf you don't pay fees
before quarterly exams,

340
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,074
our principal said that
she'll expel us from school.

341
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,578
We'll pay it once we
get our salaries.

342
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,186
Whatjob do you do to get salaries?

343
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,686
Salaries for the people, not for us.

344
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:32,684
Ranga will make you an engineer.

345
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,659
Same problem here also.

346
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:39,232
Take this money and
buy books first.

347
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,531
Somehow, l'll pay the
fees next week.

348
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,371
Take this & have biriyani. Okay.
- Okay brother.

349
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,113
You are more worried
about them than yourself.

350
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:55,216
l'm just a lonely man.
But l'm everything for them.

351
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,046
Don't you have any big desires?
- Nothing big.

352
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:02,890
l want to wear a suit, goggles.
There must be 4 men behind me.

353
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,062
And 40 men behind them.
And a dozen cars behind them.

354
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,492
A big bungalow.
And beautiful dolls.

355
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,666
Dolls? Will you play with dolls?
- l meant girls.

356
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,062
They won't be ordinary girls.

357
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,065
Our uncles?

358
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,498
Here they come for their share.

359
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,844
Hey Ranga...
- Hey Shankar...

360
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,844
lt's been a long time since we met.

361
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,912
Where were you?
Malaysia or Mylavaram?- Why?

362
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,080
Your pockets are empty.

363
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,911
l emptied my pocket knowing
that l am coming to you.

364
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,417
How are you guys?

365
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,748
You've become wiser
after going to Malaysia.

366
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,259
Did the Malaysian police arrest you and
handed you over to the Vizag police?

367
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,587
No. A senior police officer has
come from Malaysia.

368
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,593
He wants to meet you.
l've come to take you along with me.

369
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,425
Why did he send you to me?

370
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:48,693
l'm his informer in Malaysia.
- Why does he want to meet me?

371
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,534
Are you coming or not?
- Actually....

372
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,106
Ranga is here, sir.
- Greetings sir.

373
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,776
There are many cases against you.
l'll have them all withdrawn.

374
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,682
You need to do a favour to police.
- Definitely, sir.

375
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:04,444
What should l do?

376
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,454
You need to act like someone.

377
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,187
What acting?

378
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:10,960
Like who?

379
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:13,957
Like him.

380
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,129
Are you making fun of me?

381
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,299
This is me.

382
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,970
Put on a suit using graphics.
How do l look?

383
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,302
Who do you think he is?
He is not looking like you.

384
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,638
lnfact, you're looking like him.
You're a pick pocket. He's a big don.

385
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:32,982
What?
- He'll explain you the rest.

386
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,651
lt's not you.
He is Billa.

387
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:40,481
Bomb blasts, weapons dealing,
drugs smuggling, murders,

388
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,254
international terrorism.

389
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,984
Are you going to send me
in place of a notorious criminal?

390
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:45,820
What if they kill me?

391
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:50,557
No. He is in my secret
custody in Malaysia.

392
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,661
Nobody knows that.

393
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,335
You put him in jail,
why are you taking me with you?

394
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,994
You must take the place of Billa,
give me all the information l need,

395
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,900
and help me in catching
his gang & his boss.

396
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,011
Sounds like a James Bond film.
How can l change like him?

397
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,342
l'll take care of all that.

398
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,843
lnstead of spending your
entire life in jail,

399
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,754
get settled in life by being
little intelligent.

400
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,621
l've two dependents.

401
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,026
Lakshmi & Sreenu.

402
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,025
Their parents died when their
huts were gutted by fire.

403
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,198
l've the responsibility to make
them as engineer & doctor.

404
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:24,533
What if something happens
to me there?

405
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,362
Leave that to me.
You act like Billa.

406
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,695
We are leaving to Hyderabad.

407
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,535
Sir, l can't go to school now & study.
This is not fair.

408
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,048
Brother...

409
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,051
Uncle got us admitted here.
- This school is very good.

410
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,716
l got them admitted in the school
where my daughter studies.

411
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:50,723
lt's my responsibility to make them
as engineer & doctor.

412
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,724
There is a hostel here.
- Why live in hostel?

413
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,062
Let them stay with Chinni here.
What do you say?

414
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:03,232
l thought you were big people.
You are big people with big hearts.

415
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,839
Boss, l'll do anything you say.

416
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,578
Ranga, you must become Billa
from today onwards.

417
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,007
What training?

418
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,846
Sword fighting, kung-fu, horse riding...
- Don't talk loud.

419
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,249
l'll learn.
- Tiger is there.

420
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,683
Ranga, could you tell me
how many rods are here?

421
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,152
Planning to kill me right now.
- Tell me.

422
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,264
Stop counting.
- No?

423
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,195
No need.

424
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,771
76 rods, 6 gates, 18 windows.

425
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,671
lf it was Billa, he would even tell you
the number of bricks over here.

426
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,610
That's Billa.
To hell with you.

427
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,282
He can tell that.
But can he tell that boss has a wallet,

428
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,509
the wallet contains Rs.10600,
a photo of a baby,

429
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,378
and a few credit cards too.
He can't.

430
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,949
l stole it to stay in touch.
Forgive me.

431
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,723
Everyone has his own talent.

432
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,400
You need to forget that you're Ranga.

433
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,367
You have think that you're Billa.

434
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,397
And no one to command you.

435
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,033
You're boss to yourself.

436
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,804
You rascal!
- lt time to move on.- Get lost.

437
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,210
Listen to no one.
Trust no one.

438
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,550
A voice from your heart
is your conscience.

439
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,492
Trust that voice only.

440
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,159
You scoundrel!

441
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,441
You must know to cheat.

442
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,835
And also find those who cheat you.

443
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,443
You must commit murders.
But never get caught.

444
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,516
The best part l love in
my training period.

445
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:09,360
Do we need that chases, risks, training in
Malaysia instead of eating these delights?

446
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,032
Can't you sit in AC room
and work happily?

447
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:19,038
lf l don't do justice to this nation and
it's law as a dutiful officer, l can't eat.

448
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:23,210
Hubby, please come forjewel selection,
l can't decide without you.

449
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,038
l'm not able to shop.

450
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,216
Madam! Please give me an opportunity
to repay my gratitude.

451
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,048
Ask sir to turn that side
for an hour tonight,

452
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:33,484
l'll have all jewellary shops
in your place.

453
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,386
You can select from them here.
Please allow me to show my talent.

454
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,719
Please get permission from sir.

455
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:43,725
He says about his talent,
please allow him to show it.

456
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:47,061
Please don't discourage his talent,
you come sunny, let's go.

457
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,396
Janaki, you cool down.

458
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:52,908
What happened to him?

459
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,740
Billa knows very well about
every weapon in this world.

460
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,745
You must also know it.

461
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,189
Concentrate on the aim.

462
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,425
That's nothing, l shot many
balloons in carnivals.

463
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:24,435
lt went through the same hole.

464
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,939
Not the hole but
missed it by yards.

465
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,106
He's sleeping sir,
give him a punch. That's it!

466
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:37,619
You must know everything
about computer.

467
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,789
This is pen drive,
you can save information in this.

468
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,833
Now l've only one job,
take Billa to Malaysia,

469
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,970
and ensure you're caught
by local police there.

470
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,509
When did you come sir?
- Today morning.

471
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,410
lnterpol officer Dharmendra
is here for you.

472
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,580
He's waiting.

473
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,683
He wants to know
why you went to Hyderabad?

474
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,524
He's asking too many questions about
Billa's case files and it's progress.

475
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,584
We didn't know how to answer him.

476
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,461
l heard a lot about you.

477
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:07,772
You're handling Billa's case,
and you're handling it very well too,

478
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:12,442
but he gave you a slip.
- He's very smart.

479
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,118
Why did you go home on leave when
handling such a sensitive case?

480
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,719
My sister-in-law is getting married,
didn't you inform him, Adithya?

481
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:22,114
l'm the eldest son-in-law,
it's my responsibility.

482
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:24,559
Marriage!

483
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,558
Entire department is here,
just l was not here.

484
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:29,894
Now, you're also here.

485
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,730
From now onwards,
l'll handle the case.

486
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,328
l want to see Billa's case file.

487
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,142
l'm handling Billa's case,
l put in a lot of hardwork also.

488
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,741
l mean...
let's do it together.

489
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,087
Arrange for a press meet.
- Okay sir.

490
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,359
According to the information we got,

491
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:08,433
we arrested Billa while trying
to sell weapons,

492
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,606
he escaped in the shootout.

493
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,867
But we confiscated
a big cache of arms.

494
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:19,375
lt's value could be 20 million US dollars.

495
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,949
ls Billa alive or dead?

496
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:28,785
He's not dead.

497
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,292
We'll catch Billa at the earliest.

498
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,130
We need people's support also.

499
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:46,865
lf you know anything about Billa,
please inform the nearest police station.

500
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,153
A sweet news for you!

501
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:16,896
His condition?

502
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,393
Scanning reports suggest
he has memory loss.

503
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,403
l think he has forgotten his past.

504
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,733
lt means he has become like Ghajini!

505
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:28,735
What to do now?

506
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,348
When will he be normal?
- Can't say.

507
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,915
May take a week or two weeks.

508
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,686
He may get back his memory
in next five minutes also.

509
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,091
lt mean...we've to wait till then.

510
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,237
Police can't harm Billa.

511
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:03,871
But Billa mustn't be in police custody.
Devil wants Billa.

512
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,205
Rashid deal is more important.

513
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,115
Only Billa can do it.
How?

514
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,853
l'll get him.

515
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,292
l'll get Billa.
- How?

516
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,390
Today is my wedding anniversary.

517
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,396
No sir, such a day should never
come back in my life.

518
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,666
How did it happen?

519
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,243
ln broad daylight, on a road,
amidst tight security?

520
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,809
How could they take him away?
- lsn't it surprising?

521
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,342
You mustn't say that.

522
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,152
lf you police had been little careful...

523
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,351
A small correction.

524
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,689
lf we had been little more careful,

525
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:33,318
Billa's gang wouldn't have attacked and
took him from lnterpol custody.

526
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,932
Without a leak from our side,
it's impossible to attack and take him.

527
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:44,931
How long Adithya has been with you?

528
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,705
Ever since l took up Billa's case.

529
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,272
We must be careful!

530
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,123
Why are you looking as
if it's a new place?

531
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,231
This is your place.
Your island.

532
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,199
Can't remember anything?

533
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,531
l'm Ranjith, she's Lesa,

534
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,704
that's Maya,
you praised on meeting her,

535
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,405
can't you remember anyone?

536
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,414
Can't you remember me also?

537
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,319
Can you atleast remember
people you'd killed?

538
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:41,491
Who is he?

539
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,227
l don't know who l'm,

540
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,768
who is this guy now?

541
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,262
Our boss Devil.

542
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:01,576
You still have time for Rashid's deal.

543
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,849
We are shifting from here
after this deal.

544
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,188
l don't know who l'm!

545
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,765
Let him relax!

546
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,206
Girls are very hot!

547
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:46,817
ln a way life is good, but there's tension
about lurking dangers also.

548
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:49,127
How long should l've to
bear this torture?

549
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,898
That elderly man got me
into this mess.

550
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,967
When will he meet me?
How will he meet me?

551
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,171
Oh my God!

552
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,503
How did you come in sir?

553
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,847
How's Billa's life?

554
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:09,246
lt's like eating ice cream on hot sands
of desert without slippers.

555
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,247
But girls are great!

556
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,582
Have they accepted you as Billa?

557
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,917
Trust me? Lesa is throwing
herself at me.

558
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,185
Never allows me to go to bathroom also,
l'm scared of getting caught.

559
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,421
Next is Maya, first time l've fallen for
a personality rather than purse...

560
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,098
Okay...come to the point.

561
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,694
l talked to Devil.
- When and where?

562
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,200
Didn't meet but talked
to him on phone.

563
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,100
Told me take rest as there's
time for the deal.

564
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:41,609
This is the right time for you to
get back your lost memory.

565
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:46,447
You make a call to me when they
take you out next time.

566
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:47,622
How will l get back my lost memory?

567
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,950
lt'll come back as you had lost it.

568
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,295
How will you go out sir?
My people are waiting outside.

569
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,203
Sir...sir...

570
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:16,643
Sir...sir...where did he vanish?
Sir...? He's more dangerous than me.

571
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,337
Billa, Rashid's phone call.

572
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,664
He'll not speak to anyone
else other than you.

573
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:38,567
Who is Rashid?

574
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,339
We are going to have
a big deal with him.

575
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:43,170
He doesn't know about
your memory loss.

576
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,174
Manage him well.

577
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:46,673
Talk to him.

578
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:57,291
Oh Lion Billa! How are you doing?
- Fine.

579
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,021
lt's been long time
since l heard your voice.

580
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:04,197
l'm sending the first installment
tomorrow with Jimmy.

581
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:05,700
Are the goods ready?

582
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,535
Deliver it on the fixed date.

583
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,206
Bye!

584
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:15,539
Bye!

585
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,476
What is this goods?

586
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,835
How long do l know Lesa?

587
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,236
Can't you remember me, Billa?

588
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,412
We are living together for 4 years.

589
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,013
lt means brother Billa is having it with
her for 4 years, l don't want her.

590
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:58,912
Maya...?

591
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,358
She came here just a day
before you went missing.

592
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:11,697
She's mine!

593
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,621
We are going to meet Rashid's assistant
Jimmy, very dangerous man.

594
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,628
He'll talk to you only,
manage, you remember everything.

595
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,231
Do you see any difference in me?
- No.

596
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,534
Then he'll also not see it.

597
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,985
You've changed.

598
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,483
You've changed.

599
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:16,560
You're Billa!

600
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,765
Rashid bhai has sent
the first installment.

601
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,673
Goods will be delivered
on time, right?

602
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,682
You go away,
we'll take care of them.

603
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,336
Ranjith, l remember everything now.

604
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,448
Got back my lost memory.

605
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,485
Hello madam, l'm Ranga here.

606
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,383
Ranga?! How are you?

607
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:58,655
l'm fine.
How are my kids?

608
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,728
Your kids have become my kids now.
Talk to them.

609
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,999
Hello brother, we are fine,

610
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:08,262

611
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:11,005
They will stay with us only from now,
how are you doing there?

612
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:13,674
l'm having a great time,
living like a King in palace.

613
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,842
Okay, bye.

614
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:25,180
When king is not here,
l'm the king...

615
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:31,451
When Billa is not here,
you have a party Ranga!

616
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:40,701
He got back his lost memory.

617
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:01,213
He's behaving strangely, he claims
to have got back his memory,

618
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,387
but can't he remember me?

619
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,069
l remember everything.

620
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,333
l remember everything.

621
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:04,118
Oh God!

622
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:25,863
Billa, we are delivering powder for
a million ringgits to Kevin gang.

623
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:27,801
Details are in the computer.

624
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,329
Somebody has changed the
password in my absence.

625
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,658
No one will touch it
other than you and me.

626
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,738
You might've typed
the wrong password.

627
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:01,666
Are you coming to this deal?

628
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,365
What's this darling?
You said l'm back.

629
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:35,465
You said you got back
your lost memory.

630
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:36,972
Can't you still recognize me?

631
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,539
Can't l scratch your memory?

632
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:25,749
You're a cracker, l'm all yours...

633
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:30,094
My beauty, my youth,
enjoy it...

634
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:34,860
Kiss and have me...

635
01:24:35,136 --> 01:24:39,539
Can't you atleast prick me
like a honey bee?

636
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:45,011
My heart is yearning for you...

637
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:49,782
Come to me happily
without teasing me...

638
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:53,713
See me sharply...

639
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:55,890
Attack me...

640
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,955
Assail over me...

641
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:33,323
Nobody ever swept my feet
off ground like you...

642
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:38,056
l can't list out the things
l like in you...

643
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:42,259
You're one of a kind
in this world...

644
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:47,004
That's why l can't live without you...

645
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:51,677
You're an enchanting fruit...
You're a soft pillow...

646
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,340
You're the king of
my kingdom of beauty...

647
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:57,571
Your eyes have struck me
like arrows of flowers...

648
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:02,244
l'm lost in an unknown
bliss of pleasure...

649
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:06,681
There's an intoxication in
beauty and youth...

650
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:11,581
l'm burning with desire...

651
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:16,093
We are flint stones,
caress my waist to light fire...

652
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:20,757
Let's go to lonely place
to make love...

653
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:47,961
Tell me, Ranga.

654
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,789
Are you sleeping happily sir?

655
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,195
l'm working in office.
- You carry on working.

656
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,828
They are making me
do everything here.

657
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:54,796
Tell me the matter.

658
01:27:55,003 --> 01:28:00,464
l copied complete details in the pen drive
about Billa's gang and Rashid's deal.

659
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:01,808
When are you giving it to me?

660
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:06,640
Come now, sleep here tonight,
have breakfast tomorrow & take pen drive.

661
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,747
How do l know when will
they take me out?

662
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:11,144
l'll inform when l know it.

663
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:17,653
Lesa torture on one side and these suits
on the other side are killing me sir.

664
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:21,158
l want to watch a good English film
on home theatre wearing a dhothi.

665
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,886
Do you've any James Bond CD's?

666
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:33,373
No CD's, no girls,
why this nasty dress then?

667
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,853
Billa, meeting with Jimmy
tomorrow at 1 1 am.

668
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,583
Have to give plan details.

669
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:49,682
l'm also coming.

670
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,520
l'll go with Billa.

671
01:28:58,499 --> 01:28:59,363
You can come.

672
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:03,560
Any message for Rashid?

673
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:04,891
Details are in it.

674
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:07,495
Delivering the goods next week, right?

675
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,412
Would anyone saying can can
is Billa to you?

676
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,091
You're going to die.

677
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:33,920
Are you testing
if l'm real Billa or not?

678
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:35,920
Oh my God!

679
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,588
l delayed it for you to regain
your lost memory.

680
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:42,599
You must know
why l want to kill you.

681
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:46,604
You killed my brother Vikram & Priya.
You remember them?

682
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:49,541
Oh no! This looks like a tale of
flashback and revenge.

683
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:52,106
Maya, it's an illusion
that l'm Billa.

684
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:53,439
l don't know who are Vikram and Priya.

685
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,444
You'll meet them in heaven.
You'll remember then.

686
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,618
l swear on Allah, l'm not Billa.
Trust me.

687
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:18,900
Sir, you came in the boat
at the right time.

688
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:20,300
lf you'd come in car and
got stuck in a traffic jam,

689
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:21,372
she would've killed me by now.

690
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,076
Why do you want to kill Billa?

691
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,576
Tell her first that l'm not Billa,
she's determined to kill me.

692
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:29,977
He's not Billa, he's Ranga.

693
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:33,153
Where is Billa then?
- Billa is with me,

694
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:35,652
he got seriously injured
in the police attack,

695
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:37,984
l've hidden him in a secret place.
He's dying.

696
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:42,595
To catch Billa's gang and Devil,
l made Ranga to impersonate as Billa.

697
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,997
Aren't you a member of Billa's gang?
- l acted like that.

698
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:50,835
l entered his gang to avenge
the killing of my brother.

699
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:54,906
That's the matter.
l'm not Billa, l'm Ranga.

700
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:03,843
Here's the pen drive,
all the details are in it.

701
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:10,119
Other than we three nobody else
must know that he's Ranga.

702
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,849
l don't have anything to
do there without Billa.

703
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,358
Your sudden disappearance
will raise suspicion.

704
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:19,021
Till now it was your personal revenge,
now it's about security of our country.

705
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:23,133
Yes, we need your co-operation.

706
01:32:23,504 --> 01:32:25,972
Sir, please be careful with Billa,

707
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:28,366
if he comes out, l'm dead.

708
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:38,049
l got carried away by your mini skirts,
are you a killer lady?

709
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,389
You would be dead by now.
l missed target three times.

710
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:47,318
l appear like Billa but
l'm very innocent.

711
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:48,654
That's why l fell in love with you.

712
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,057
Don't you wear saris?

713
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:53,726
lt won't look good to see you
in such outfits in Vizag.

714
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:56,568
People may give bad looks.
- Why would l be in Vizag?

715
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:00,399
Don't say like that, once Devil's dead,
we are not needed here,

716
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:01,732
you too don't have anyone,

717
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:03,570
let's go back to Vizag and
settle down there.

718
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:06,144
You appeared like James Bond film's
heroine to me,

719
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,177
l'm known as James Bond
in my place, that's another thing,

720
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:10,748
don't say no to me,
we'll make a great couple, say okay.

721
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:11,742
Let's go.

722
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:14,751
Has she understood me?

723
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:17,590
Oh God! You got her boy!

724
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,654
You're great!

725
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:39,777
This is fine!

726
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,948
Fence for audience
and romance for us.

727
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:44,512
We'll be caught.

728
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,118
lt's enough if l don't get caught
with that fat girl.

729
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,990
ls it wrestling to win?

730
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:40,340
Devil has arranged a meeting tomorrow
with all members of the network.

731
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:41,333
Why?

732
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,339
Rashid bhai is paying the
final installment.

733
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,452
Tomorrow is our final deal
in Malaysia.

734
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:56,346
ls Shangrila hotel okay or
is there any problem with police?

735
01:34:58,225 --> 01:34:58,919
Let's meet tomorrow.

736
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,258
Ranga, you'll be free.

737
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:12,198
Sir, l can go back to Vizag.

738
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:13,202
Tell me the matter.

739
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:17,634
Billa is meeting with all his
international contacts tomorrow.

740
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:18,709
Devil is also attending.

741
01:35:18,913 --> 01:35:19,709
How do you know this?

742
01:35:19,914 --> 01:35:21,040
Devil himself called to inform me.

743
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,216
Meeting is at 9 pm tomorrow.
- Where?

744
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,052
Shangrila hotel.
- l've been waiting for this.

745
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:28,481
Listen carefully,

746
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,886
Devil is more dangerous
than my expectation,

747
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:36,894
he got hold of undetectable
explosives from Russian army.

748
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:38,629
He's selling them to Rashid.

749
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:42,662
lf it's used, few countries will
disappear from the world map.

750
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,902
Equivalent to nuclear bombs.
- You take care of it sir,

751
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:50,077
don't barge in like lndian police but
slip in silently like English police.

752
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:51,403
But come with a big platoon.

753
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,240
But you'll come and
surrender to me only.

754
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,747
Okay, you slip in silently and
finish yourjob silently.

755
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:06,752
Why are you behaving like this?

756
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:08,929
You've changed.

757
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,993
You're not the old Billa l know.

758
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:15,262
You're staying away from me.

759
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:17,862
lsn't it for her?

760
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:19,932
Who?
- Maya!

761
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:22,935
You've fallen to her charm.

762
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:38,857
Billa, we are not going
to Shangrila hotel,

763
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:42,121
we are going to Park hotel in Putrujaya.
- Why?

764
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,623
We've information that police
is going to raid there.

765
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:45,628
How do you know it?

766
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,234
We do know the movements of police.

767
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:50,299
Who changed it?

768
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:52,236
Why wasn't l informed?

769
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:53,700
l'm informing you now, right?

770
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:24,337
Tell me.

771
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:27,837
Sir, don't go to Shangrila hotel,
location is changed.

772
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:30,336
Why? Where now?

773
01:37:30,811 --> 01:37:32,676
Putrujaya Park hotel.
- Why there?

774
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,507
They know about your coming.

775
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:36,843
Devil's informer is in your department.

776
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:40,282
First find that black sheep,
l'll manage here till then.- Okay.

777
01:37:54,802 --> 01:37:56,531
l heard your talk.

778
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:00,037
Who are you?

779
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:04,110
You avoided my advances,

780
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:08,046
l got a suspicion that
you're not Billa,

781
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:09,879
who are you?

782
01:38:11,485 --> 01:38:12,474
Don't come near me.

783
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:33,068
lt happened unwittingly,
l didn't fire wantonly.

784
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:38,238
Where is my Billa?

785
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:09,275
What happened Billa?

786
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:07,823
l'm a style icon...l've grown like a dictator...
The world bows to me...

787
01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:12,169
l'll never tread the same path
l travelled earlier...

788
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:14,841
Nobody can everjudge
my next move...

789
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:19,008
When l spread net,
the world falls into it...

790
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:22,671
When l walk,
it'll create tremors...

791
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:33,122
l'm a one man army...
Lightning Billa...

792
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:36,591
l'm a walking lightning...

793
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:17,061
l'm death to my enemies...
l'm terror to them...

794
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:24,901
lf l face fear, l'll play with it...
Bury it deep down in earth...

795
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:28,411
My step will send shivers down
the spine of thunder...

796
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:31,914
My weapon is my breath...

797
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:35,421
Thunder Billa...

798
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:38,750
Who will dare face me?

799
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:42,418
Tiger Billa...

800
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:45,927
When l pounce,
nobody can escape...

801
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:24,067
l don't trust men...
l don't think with heart...

802
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:26,796
l watch myself as shadow...

803
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:30,973
l'm always alert...
Never allow danger to near me...

804
01:42:31,178 --> 01:42:34,147
l'll win over death...

805
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:37,647
My past is over with yesterday...

806
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:41,150
This moment is with me,
tomorrow it's past...

807
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:44,815
Deadly Billa...

808
01:42:45,025 --> 01:42:48,153
How will you stop the
flow of molten lava?

809
01:42:51,865 --> 01:42:55,164
Nobody knows my next move...

810
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:16,413
l'll talk to you later.

811
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,243
We are celebrating your
birthday here.

812
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:21,648
l'll talk to you later.

813
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:23,681
Cut the call.

814
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:26,854
l'll talk to you later l say.

815
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:33,696
Cut the line.

816
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,130
Sir...sir...what happened?
What happened sir?

817
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:19,239
Devil...don't spare him...don't...

818
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:28,219
Sir...sir...

819
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,014
l'm not Billa, my name is Ranga.

820
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:02,285
Native of Vizag.

821
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:04,285
ACP asked me to impersonate as Billa.

822
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:08,459
Trust me sir.
- No, you're Billa.

823
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:09,855
You killed ACP.

824
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:13,125
ACP himself came to me and
trained me to act like Billa.

825
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,527
Why would l kill him?

826
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:19,365
That means Billa is a good actor too
along with smuggling and killing.

827
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:25,143
After the accident,
ACP has hidden Billa somewhere.

828
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:27,376
How do you know the party place?

829
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:30,376
How do you know it was changed?
How did police arrive there?

830
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:34,045
l informed ACP about the meeting.

831
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:38,889
As you know about police movements,
we too know your movements.

832
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:41,817
l don't need to tell you that.

833
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:43,552
lf l assume you're right,

834
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:48,290
why would ACP need to
infiltrate Billa's gang?

835
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:52,727
To catch Devil, Billa's boss
and his deal with Rashid.

836
01:46:53,273 --> 01:46:56,731
Forget it, tell me one thing that
can prove you're not Billa.

837
01:47:01,548 --> 01:47:05,314
l gave a pen drive to ACP
with complete details of Billa's gang.

838
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,516
Where is the pen drive now?

839
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:10,413
With ACP.
- Check his flat.

840
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:12,421
Adithya, please check it.

841
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,761
He's lying.
He's trying to escape.

842
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:22,432
Please stop sir, he's telling you,
please search sir.

843
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,778
Don't put me in this cell!

844
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:01,239
Stop play acting and tell me,
where is Billa?

845
01:48:01,441 --> 01:48:04,069
My foot Billa!

846
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:09,812
lf we fight him, police will come
to know he's not Billa.

847
01:48:12,252 --> 01:48:15,483
lf police find that pen drive,
you'll go to the jail for life.

848
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:17,213
l can go out free.

849
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:22,491
Even foreign jails don't have AC cells.

850
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:26,498
Ranjith, order a good tea for me.

851
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:30,997
No need, l can't have it after
seeing your dirty face.

852
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:10,872
We didn't find any pen drive
as you told us.

853
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:11,702
Didn't find sir?

854
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:14,210
So, there's no evidence to prove
that you're Ranga.

855
01:49:14,748 --> 01:49:16,648
Sir, l suspect him.

856
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:19,036
Hey! Do you know the
biggest mistake of your life?

857
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:22,046
lmpersonating as Billa.

858
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:25,046
You fooled us all.

859
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:27,377
Are you lAS officers if not fools?

860
01:50:27,988 --> 01:50:30,286
Are you dons if you've
few boys in the gang?

861
01:50:32,993 --> 01:50:35,291
Bloody idiots!

862
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,960
What about you man?
Who cut your hair?

863
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:42,294
You look like a dirty beggar.

864
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:49,130
And this guy feels it is goggles
using lorry window shield.

865
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:52,808
Dirty face! Moreover tattoo marks
all over the body.

866
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:57,243
Bloody shit face!

867
01:50:57,617 --> 01:50:59,482
Come...come...

868
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:03,387
You've an idea about Billa,

869
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,249
okay,

870
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:08,655
but l don't know how l'll beat you.
l'll thrash you!

871
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:13,829
Mark, you're a cross mark.

872
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:16,502
Bloody garbage seller.

873
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:18,661
Why are you staring at me?

874
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:24,333
Won't you ever smile?
What's in your mouth? Nail?

875
01:51:25,211 --> 01:51:26,178
Always with a sullen face!

876
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:31,612
lf we hurt you now,
they will know you're not Billa.

877
01:51:32,485 --> 01:51:33,509
You'll escape!

878
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:38,847
You impersonated as Billa,
so die as Billa.

879
01:51:39,559 --> 01:51:41,288
After reaching central jail.

880
01:51:41,494 --> 01:51:45,931
No...no man...you don't have
brain or any sensitiveness.

881
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:47,360
That's not your fault.

882
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:48,697
Just a second.

883
01:51:51,504 --> 01:51:54,530
He's laughing, you know what l told him,
you've too many daddies.

884
01:52:34,114 --> 01:52:35,138
Escape easily!

885
01:52:37,117 --> 01:52:38,084
l'm sure he's Billa.

886
01:52:38,618 --> 01:52:40,586
Already we've issued
shoot-at-sight orders.

887
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:42,421
Don't kill him.

888
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:44,750
Arrange police pickets.

889
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:46,755
Check every place.

890
01:52:50,563 --> 01:52:52,588
Ranga and ACP fooled us.

891
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:54,426
Don't know where they
have hidden Billa.

892
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:57,937
We must find Ranga and
he'll die in my hands only.

893
01:53:02,408 --> 01:53:05,377
ldiot! How would we know
where is Billa if you leave Ranga?

894
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:08,204
We must wind up Rashid's deal
by tomorrow.

895
01:53:08,414 --> 01:53:10,609
l want that pen drive,
else we'll be in risk.

896
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:38,808
What happened?

897
01:53:39,345 --> 01:53:43,304
They know l'm not Billa.
- l know, poor ACP!

898
01:53:43,616 --> 01:53:44,742
Don't know who killed him,

899
01:53:45,285 --> 01:53:46,877
shoot-at-sight orders have
been issued against you.

900
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:49,718
Ranjith gang is after you.
- l know.

901
01:53:50,523 --> 01:53:52,787
First l must find the killer of ACP.

902
01:53:53,193 --> 01:53:56,993
Police want me as Billa,
Billa's gang want me to find their boss,

903
01:53:57,430 --> 01:54:00,228
they didn't suspect you, did they?
- No, they trust me.

904
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:03,594
What if l inform police that
you're Ranga and not Billa?

905
01:54:03,903 --> 01:54:06,337
No, l don't want you to face
any problem because of me.

906
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:09,000
There's a mole in police,

907
01:54:09,709 --> 01:54:11,836
you must be with the gang
to keep me informed.

908
01:54:12,378 --> 01:54:13,675
What are you going to do now?
- Come.

909
01:54:16,883 --> 01:54:19,283
l must call lnterpol officer Dharmendra,

910
01:54:19,485 --> 01:54:21,783
only he believes me after ACP.

911
01:54:21,988 --> 01:54:22,852
Just a minute.

912
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:50,208
Ranga here.
- Tell me Billa.

913
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:52,312
How many times should
l tell you l'm not Billa?

914
01:54:52,752 --> 01:54:54,219
lf not then surrender immediately.

915
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:57,656
l'm not scared to surrender,

916
01:54:58,258 --> 01:55:00,556
l don't trust anyone in the
department other than you, sir.

917
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:03,987
lf l'm in jail l can't prove
that l'm not Billa.

918
01:55:04,197 --> 01:55:05,221
Why did you call me then?

919
01:55:05,765 --> 01:55:07,562
Come tomorrow to Aerobridge at noon.

920
01:55:07,934 --> 01:55:08,662
Come alone!

921
01:55:15,108 --> 01:55:16,405
You be careful there.

922
01:55:22,615 --> 01:55:23,411
What to do now?

923
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:44,767
l didn't do it wantonly.

924
01:55:45,805 --> 01:55:48,205
Seeing police here suddenly,
l reacted unwittingly.

925
01:55:55,915 --> 01:55:57,041
This was wantonly.

926
01:56:00,987 --> 01:56:01,885
Wantonly!

927
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:51,161
O hot girl! Let's have fun,
would you like to come?

928
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:55,166
Will you kiss me hot
to make chilly chill?

929
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:59,003
Will you come even
after l refused you?

930
01:56:59,278 --> 01:57:02,509
Will you leave taking
my refusal as an answer?

931
01:57:02,715 --> 01:57:10,178
O Bommali!
l'll not leave you...

932
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:17,853
Let's tie the knot first
and have fun later...

933
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:19,861
Where's the sacred thread?

934
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:22,364
l want to make you my wife...

935
01:57:22,568 --> 01:57:25,833
Marry me...
My life is empty now...

936
01:58:12,618 --> 01:58:15,917
O mischievous boy!
You're an adventurer!

937
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:20,253
Will you enjoy the fun?
Will you make love?

938
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:23,691
l'm not so adventurous...

939
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:28,256
Will you enter into a relationship
and fulfill my desires?

940
01:58:28,468 --> 01:58:36,432
l'll mesmerise you...
There's good times ahead for us...

941
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:57,849
Caress my lovely cheeks...

942
01:59:58,057 --> 02:00:01,857
Will you allow me to rock you?
Would you like to taste the bliss?

943
02:00:02,061 --> 02:00:05,360
l'm a tender flower,
lay siege on me...

944
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:09,698
Will you give your heart,
body and soul to me?

945
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:18,205
lf you're excited by my gestures,
have a go at me then...

946
02:01:01,387 --> 02:01:05,255
O hot girl! Let's have fun,
would you like to come?

947
02:01:06,959 --> 02:01:09,928
Who is it?
Lord Ventakateshwara?

948
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:13,930
Pardon me lord!
Malaysia Subramanya Swamy.

949
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,929
l mistook you for Lord of Tirupathy.

950
02:01:18,638 --> 02:01:20,606
l escaped from police
after having your glimpse.

951
02:01:20,806 --> 02:01:22,103
My love issue is also settled.

952
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:26,443
Godfather sir is no more,
l don't have anyone other than you.

953
02:01:26,979 --> 02:01:28,276
what should l do now, Lord?

954
02:01:28,481 --> 02:01:30,779
Where am l to go?
Show me the way, lord!

955
02:01:30,983 --> 02:01:34,612
Let bygones be bygones...

956
02:01:40,059 --> 02:01:43,290
Met you after long time,
where did you go away?

957
02:01:43,829 --> 02:01:45,194
Do you know they killed sir?

958
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:49,630
l know it, that's why l got drunk
after closing the hotel.

959
02:01:50,503 --> 02:01:53,802
Tell me where is Billa hiding?

960
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:56,231
Malaysia police is after me.

961
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:01,139
Hold this?
- Hold it!

962
02:02:03,516 --> 02:02:05,484
Come, l'll show you.

963
02:02:09,355 --> 02:02:09,844
Be careful.

964
02:02:10,056 --> 02:02:13,150
Where are you man?
- You keep quiet.

965
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:14,754
ls he in this room?

966
02:02:16,295 --> 02:02:17,319
lt's very cold.

967
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:21,429
This is very large fridge,
it'll be very cold.

968
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:22,498
Where is Billa?

969
02:02:25,705 --> 02:02:26,831
Hello Billa!

970
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:30,675
Get up...get up...

971
02:02:33,212 --> 02:02:35,510
He won't get up, he's dead.

972
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:39,584
After he died,

973
02:02:40,052 --> 02:02:43,510
ACP trained and brought you
from Vizag to Malaysia.

974
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:46,021
Fearing you may back off,
he didn't tell you.

975
02:02:48,227 --> 02:02:49,353
lt has come down fully.

976
02:02:52,331 --> 02:02:54,356
How come you gave the
bad news so coldly?

977
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:58,698
Who told ACP about me?

978
02:03:03,909 --> 02:03:09,040
l gave him information about you
and l'm his informer.

979
02:03:24,096 --> 02:03:29,398
lf l don't do justice to this nation
and it's law as a dutiful officer,

980
02:03:30,035 --> 02:03:31,400
l can't eat.

981
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:34,565
Poor man!

982
02:03:35,374 --> 02:03:40,573
He died serving the country.

983
02:03:41,447 --> 02:03:42,505
What's your plan now?

984
02:03:42,948 --> 02:03:44,074
l can't trust police anymore,

985
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:47,177
l'm going to meet tomorrow
lnterpol officer Dharmendra,

986
02:03:47,953 --> 02:03:49,250
only he can help me.

987
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:34,299
Tell me.

988
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:36,127
ACP asked me to act as Billa.

989
02:04:36,335 --> 02:04:39,202
He's no more,
only you trust me now.

990
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:41,230
That's why l asked you to come alone.

991
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:45,900
Like l was ACP's informer in the gang,
there's a mole in police also.

992
02:04:46,111 --> 02:04:47,806
Where's the pen drive
you gave to ACP?

993
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:52,477
Tell me where is Billa?
Otherwise you'll go for good.

994
02:04:52,685 --> 02:04:54,312
You'll be the real Billa.

995
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,147
l'm not Billa, l'm Ranga.

996
02:04:56,522 --> 02:04:57,147
Listen...

997
02:04:59,358 --> 02:05:00,655
Ranjith and his gang are here.

998
02:05:03,028 --> 02:05:09,991
l know you're not Billa,
nobody knows Billa more than me,

999
02:05:10,636 --> 02:05:13,730
Where is the pen drive?
Where is Billa?

1000
02:05:14,707 --> 02:05:16,607
That means...you're the Devil!

1001
02:05:17,543 --> 02:05:18,840
Only you knew that l was coming here.

1002
02:05:19,245 --> 02:05:21,509
Who is the man with Ranga?
- Devil!

1003
02:05:23,883 --> 02:05:26,010
Yes, l'm Devil!

1004
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:35,526
l killed ACP.
He knew my true identity.

1005
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:45,694
Where is Billa?

1006
02:06:40,626 --> 02:06:41,251
Lover?

1007
02:07:29,842 --> 02:07:32,811
Listen to me, l know you're Ranga
and not Billa.

1008
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:40,045
ACP told me everything
the day he died,

1009
02:07:41,186 --> 02:07:43,154
l've the pen drive you gave to ACP.

1010
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:48,392
Why are you following me then?

1011
02:07:49,862 --> 02:07:51,989
To find Devil and arrest him.

1012
02:07:53,365 --> 02:07:56,766
Devil is none other than
lnterpol officer Dharmendra.

1013
02:07:58,704 --> 02:08:03,004
Yes, Dharmendra didn'tjoin
with ACP to arrest Billa,

1014
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:05,172
but know whereabouts of Billa,

1015
02:08:05,944 --> 02:08:08,174
he killed ACP also,

1016
02:08:09,214 --> 02:08:12,240
his gang is after my life,
now that l know the truth.

1017
02:08:16,055 --> 02:08:18,182
l can't believe Dharmendra is Devil,

1018
02:08:18,991 --> 02:08:20,515
how can the police department
believe it?

1019
02:08:22,561 --> 02:08:23,357
We must do something.

1020
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:26,525
lf not ACP's death would've
no meaning.

1021
02:08:26,732 --> 02:08:30,361
He would've caught this gang easily,
his aim was to stop the Rashid deal.

1022
02:08:36,575 --> 02:08:39,806
l'll send you safely to Vizag.
- l'll not go sir.

1023

Just do as l say.
- Okay.

1027
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:11,910
We must catch Devil at any cost,
and stop Rashid's deal.

Got information that ACP has hidden Billa
in an Andhra restaurant near temple.

1030
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:39,764
Don't tell anyone about this.

1031
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:42,766
You go there alone.

1032
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:55,277
Don't leave Ranga,

1033
02:09:55,988 --> 02:09:59,287

near the temple.

02:12:09,721 --> 02:12:11,245
Where is Lesa?

1037
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:15,586
Billa, he cheated us.
He impersonated as you.

1038
02:12:16,194 --> 02:12:17,422
He killed Lesa too.

1039
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:08,646
Where is Billa?

1040
02:13:10,515 --> 02:13:13,416
The explosives Billa promised
to deliver you is ready.

02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:39,104
lf you're Devil,
then l'm a Demon.

1048
02:13:55,227 --> 02:13:55,693
What happened?

1049
02:13:57,095 --> 02:13:58,027

Tiger has arrived!

1053
02:15:41,833 --> 02:15:44,961
Have you come here to seek revenge
for killing your brother and Priya?

1054

comes seeking revenge,

02:15:54,846 --> 02:15:56,905

Hey Tiger!

1057
02:16:24,376 --> 02:16:28,836
Don't know why,

Your undetectable Russian explosives
are in that cargo plane,

1062
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:24,966
The game's over!

1063
02:17:30,942 --> 02:17:31,738
Tiger!

1064
02:17:35,447 --> 02:17:36,243
Let's meet again.

1065
02:17:37,048 --> 02:17:38,413
Bye!

1066
02:17:43,121 --> 02:17:46,090

1067
02:18:10,148 --> 02:18:13,379
l waited till now for this deal only,

1068
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:21,459
l'm helpless without you.

1069
02:18:21,993 --> 02:18:27,226
You went missing,
l got scared of getting caught.

1070
02:18:48,186 --> 02:18:50,654
You were required for this deal only.

1071
02:18:51,456 --> 02:18:52,980
l ordered you to kill ACP.

1072
02:18:55,193 --> 02:18:59,823
l decided then to kill this killer fish.

1073
02:19:02,534 --> 02:19:03,660
What do you think of yourself?

1074
02:19:04,869 --> 02:19:05,767
You're just my mask!

1075
02:19:08,206 --> 02:19:09,571
l made you!

1076
02:19:10,608 --> 02:19:11,836
How dare you try to dominate me?

1077
02:19:13,478 --> 02:19:15,844
Ranjith will replace you from now.

1078
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:24,511
Devil will not kill Billa,
lnterpol officer Dharmendra will.

1079
02:19:27,158 --> 02:19:28,420
You gave me Billa's place.

1080
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:32,189
Please give me the chance
to kill Billa also.

1081
02:24:07,839 --> 02:24:13,471
lt's not Billa who shot you now,
Ranga from Visakhapatnam. Got it?

1082
02:25:06,364 --> 02:25:07,854
We know you're Devil.

1083
02:25:17,942 --> 02:25:21,639
This is Ranga's plan,
he fooled you all as Billa.

1084
02:25:21,846 --> 02:25:24,314
Billa's dead body too
helped him in this.

1085
02:25:24,682 --> 02:25:27,150
He fulfilled ACP's wish of
apprehending Rashid.

1086
02:25:29,353 --> 02:25:30,479
lt's all recorded.

1087
02:26:04,422 --> 02:26:05,514
You thought it was Billa, right?

1088
02:26:05,723 --> 02:26:07,350
l couldn't get you without taking risk.

1089
02:26:07,558 --> 02:26:08,354
You gave me a big shock.

1090
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:10,754
Pack your bags.
Let's go to Vizag.

1091
02:26:10,962 --> 02:26:12,122
Will you buy clothes for me there?

1092
02:26:12,330 --> 02:26:14,958
Buy? You don't know
about my talent. l'll steal.

1093
02:26:18,736 --> 02:26:20,966
We are like this for
not attending school.

1094
02:26:21,506 --> 02:26:23,872
Let's build a good orphanage
and a good school.

1095
02:26:24,075 --> 02:26:25,702
No fees, it's free.

1096
02:26:26,244 --> 02:26:28,007
lt'll cost Rs.1 crore.
- No problem.

1097
02:26:28,246 --> 02:26:29,213
Will just a school do?

1098
02:26:29,413 --> 02:26:30,209
What about college?

1099
02:26:30,414 --> 02:26:33,212
Let's build a college too.
No fees, it's also free.

1100

lt'll cost us Rs.2 crores.
- No problem.

1101
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:36,386
How come?

1102
02:26:38,689 --> 02:26:40,281
Apart from the government reward,

1103
02:26:41,526 --> 02:26:43,892
l stole four suitcases
full of cash from Billa.

1104
02:26:45,696 --> 02:26:48,392
Once the cash is over,
what will you do?
