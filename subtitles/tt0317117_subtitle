1
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:01,608
Amrit.
- Who is it?

2
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:09,083
Shall I come in?
- No! I'm taking a shower.

3
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,619
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

4
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:18,718
Just waiting for the star of
the show. He's still in the bath.

5
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:22,556
Is it Moti? Come in. Alone.

6
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,863
Are you alone?
- Yes, buddy.

7
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:29,301
Odd time for a shower!
The show is due in 15 minutes.

8
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,303
Just a minute.

9
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,237
Music is food for me.
You know that, don't you?

10
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,403
Yes.

11
00:02:35,478 --> 00:02:38,311
So I touch the guitar
only after a shower.

12
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,780
That reminds me... there's something
important I want to discuss.

13
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,852
What is it?
- There's a lot of competition...

14
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,115
in the music world today.
If you aren't competent enough...

15
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:49,056
you'll find the ground slipping
from under your feet.

16
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:52,992
I saw a good quality guitar
in the music shop. Gibson's.

17
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,032
If I could get an advance
of 4000...

18
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:59,760
From me?
- From the hotel.

19
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:03,795
You know that it's against the
hotel's policy to give an advance.

20
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,398
And the manager, that's me,
hasn't any money either.

21
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:10,138
Do something. Please!

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,046
All right. I'll talk to Mr Kalua,
He's the one who manages everything.

23
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,244
Do it for me, buddy.
- Be quick. Here's your towel.

24
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,631
I can't make it to the show.
- Why not?

25
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:09,069
I feel sorry to say that Amrit
can't make it to the show today.

26
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,832
His life is in danger.

27
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,871
We won't move from here
without hearing his song.

28
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,878
He has to come.
- Of course!

29
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:21,882
Hear that? Will you come now?

30
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:27,388
The house is full, Jaswant.
Get on with your act.

31
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,132
He shot him.

32
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:01,819
We enjoyed your song very much.

33
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:05,092
I'm Miss Malhotra.
And she is my sister, Babli.

34
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,895
She's thrilled with your song.

35
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:11,897
She'd be delighted to have an
autographed copy of your song.

36
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:14,559
Sure. Your room number?
- 801.

37
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:15,898
The copy will reach you.

38
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,177
Miss Luska, you're
a terrific dancer!

39
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:25,670
Sir, I'm tired!

40
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,750
Tired? I'll give you a massage.

41
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:31,380
It's tickling!
- Tickling?

42
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,182
I'm a master tickler.

43
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,055
I'll tickle you.

44
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,591
It will help you relax.

45
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,825
Is it tickling now?
- No.

46
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,260
I have warned you earlier.
- But...

47
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,794
No buts! Just shut up!
I'll talk to you later.

48
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,170
Luska, I've nothing to do
with your private life.

49
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:55,073
But, this hotel has a rule...

50
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:57,202
Guests are not allowed
to mingle with the staff.

51
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,147
Mr Singh, you are mistaken.
He is Dr. Jamnadas.

52
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,046
I don't care who he is.

53
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:05,086
Your contract with this hotel
comes to an end.

54
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,587
Hear me out, Mr Singh. Please!

55
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,887
I hurt my legs while dancing.

56
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,756
He said he'll fix it.

57
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,888
I came here for a check-up.

58
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:17,988
But he tried to...

59
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,228
One cannot judge a person
by his face, you know.

60
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:24,373
Stop this nonsense! Pack your bag.
And get out of here.

61
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,302
And you mister?

62
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,914
Now to deal with you!

63
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,984
There are two ways out.

64
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:38,586
First: To call the police
and lock you up.

65
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:41,053
But it will bring disrepute
to our hotel.

66
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,590
I think the second
would suit you fine.

67
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,854
I'll call your wife and...
- No! She will kill me!

68
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:48,861
How will I face my children?

69
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:52,662
What is worse is that the elections
are due in two months.

70
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:56,670
If this blows into a scandal,
my political career will be ruined.

71
00:11:56,806 --> 00:12:00,003
I beg of you! Forgive me!

72
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,006
You are still here?
- Shut up!

73
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,805
How much did you strip him of?
- 10,000.

74
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,141
Here's your 5,000.

75
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,882
Someday you will slice my nose.
- My pleasure!

76
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,751
Back by?
- After the office hours.

77
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,623
Here's 5,000.

78
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:23,994
You need 4,000, don't you?
Count it. All of 5,000.

79
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,065
The rates are unpredictable today.

80
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:31,571
You might find the rates
of the guitar increased.

81
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:34,676
So keep 5,000 with you.

82
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,109
All right. But, it may take
some time to repay the amount.

83
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,771
Don't repay it.

84
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,713
Impossible.
- Come on!

85
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,912
There are many ways to pay back.

86
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:50,924
Come to me. Sit close to me.
Let's talk about love.

87
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,922
Take the money, Luska.
And get out of here.

88
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,136
Amrit, this will prove
very costly to you.

89
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:05,866
So costly that forget the principal
amount, the interest will kill you.

90
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,287
Strange!
She kept the door open.

91
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,692
Here's the song with my autograph.

92
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:25,883
Bye!

93
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,196
B.K.? You?

94
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:47,174
You are the security in-charge.
And you steal?

95
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,414
No, I wasn't stealing.

96
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:54,122
I am helpless.

97
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:58,260
My mother is ill.
She is suffering from cancer.

98
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:01,921
You know cancer has no cure.
The doctor has advised an operation.

99
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:04,123
Which is why...
- Don't you lie!

100
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,996
You mother died 2 years ago.
- She was my real mother.

101
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,127
And this is my step-mother.

102
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:12,735
If I neglect her, her children
will look down upon me.

103
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,673
They'll say I left her to die,
since she's a step-mother to me.

104
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,149
Put an end to it.
Hand me over to the police.

105
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:23,874
It's all right...

106
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:28,745
Put it back.
And don't do it again.

107
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,153
There wasn't a way out.
I was helpless, friend!

108
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:36,063
How much will you need
for the operation?

109
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,190
Say a minimum of 5,000 or 7,000.

110
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:44,663
Why didn't you ask Luska?
- How can I ask my girlfriend?

111
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,704
There's some sense
of modesty in me.

112
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,645
I'll try my best to help you.

113
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,577
Thank you, friend.

114
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:56,207
You saved me from doing wrong.

115
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,312
I'm indebted to you.

116
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,248
Never do it again.

117
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:19,868
What happened?

118
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,606
What has he done?
- He tried to rape me.

119
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:29,047
I ran away from him.
And hid in your room.

120
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,881
Scoundrel! I'll shoot him.
- Wait.

121
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,178
Sit.

122
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,883
It's no use killing him.
You will go to the gallows.

123
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:40,350
Then?

124
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:44,097
Teach him a lesson. For life!

125
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,733
For me?
- No.

126
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:52,896
For Amrit.

127
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:56,108
B. K, what's the matter?

128
00:15:57,246 --> 00:16:00,647
I kept the song in your room.
Did you get it?

129
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:04,378
She got it.
But, she lost a necklace.

130
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:12,055
I don't...
- I never expected this from you.

131
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:13,517
What?

132
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,926
You mean to say I stole it?

133
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,295
Why should I?
- You need it.

134
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,594
Yesterday you asked 4,000
from me, didn't you?

135
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:23,637
Strange! You can frisk me.
Search my room if you want to.

136
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,865
That's unavoidable. Bhagwat...

137
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:35,042
Forgive me, sir. I will search...
But he is not that type.

138
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,845
I know. Please...

139
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,542
You are strange!

140
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:44,553
I am a fan of yours.
You could've asked me for the money.

141
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,117
Why should you steal?

142
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:47,889
Could you come in, Mr Moti.

143
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:52,890
It's mine.

144
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:57,902
The crime is proved.

145
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,979
The court gives Mr Amrit Kumar Saxena
rigorous imprisonment for two years.

146
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:13,849
Moti? You?

147
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,919
Just like my hotel room,
a telephone is provided to me here.

148
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:22,121
You could've called me.
Why take the trouble to come here?

149
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,694
You'll never change, buddy.

150
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:28,737
I will, if they were
to reduce my sentence.

151
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,998
But, it's no use now.
- Right.

152
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:33,870
I know you are not guilty.

153
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:37,811
You are right.
But, how do you know that?

154
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,843
The other day I saw Luska and B. K
quarrel over something.

155
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:48,047
I found out that they were
the ones who tricked you.

156
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:51,752
I want some kind of evidence to...

157
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,885
Do something. Think.

158
00:17:56,198 --> 00:18:00,635
Moti, they say that if the convict's
conduct is satisfactory...

159
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,033
he gets a pardon of eight-ten months.

160
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,538
The jailer is impressed with me.
I'll apply for amnesty.

161
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:08,234
I'll come to you if they accept it.

162
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,455
What happened?
- Did it break down?

163
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,192
Get down everyone. Take some rest.
We have a broken accelerator.

164
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,867
What's happening there?
What's the fuss about?

165
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,872
Get on with the show.
Or, return our money.

166
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,380
Right.

167
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,610
I beg of you! Please forgive me!

168
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:57,021
The road is closed out there.
And the star of the show is stuck.

169
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:01,892
Without him the show won't kick off.

170
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:05,023
But your pocket isn't stuck.
Give us our money back.

171
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,567
Just a minute.
Tell me, what's the problem?

172
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,831
He charged us, but won't begin
the show. He has stomached the money.

173
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:14,238
This is wrong. Go on with the show,
or return the money.

174
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,502
Return the money?
How are we to feed ourselves?

175
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:19,836
Sir...

176
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:24,710
Sir, we are poor souls.
We struggle to earn for a living.

177
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:29,620
Our lead singer is stuck out there
due to closed roads.

178
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:32,955
Help us. Please!
Make them see reasons.

179
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,528
I can't solve the money matter.
But I can surely help you.

180
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,531
Pronto!

181
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:40,563
The show was great!
You were excellent!

182
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:42,898
Your share.

183
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:46,969
Money? Helpers seek no gain.

184
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:48,906
You asked for help,
so I helped.

185
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:56,114
If not money, something else?

186
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,680
"Arms like sandalwood"

187
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:00,749
"Rosy lips"

188
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,857
Look at me!

189
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:05,049
Am I not worthy of it?

190
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:09,854
Why shy away so much, Mr Amrit?

191
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:16,135
How do you know my name?
- I know much more.

192
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:19,936
My father has two daughters.

193
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,339
Shabnam... that's me.

194
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:25,674
And Kajal.

195
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:30,841
She ran away with a man
from the town, some time back.

196
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:33,819
Later, started dancing in hotels.

197
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:38,085
I even know that she and B.K.
Falsely implicated you...

198
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,888
in a theft case. Right?

199
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,162
I have a picture of you and Kajal.

200
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,399
Aren't you the one?

201
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,400
Luska and me?!

202
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,569
Is Luska your sister Kajal?
- Yes.

203
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:58,168
Bhagwat Singh is a scoundrel!

204
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,406
Kajal isn't a bad girl.

205
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:04,779
How do you know Bhagwat Singh?
- I have met him once.

206
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,117
Mother once fell ill at her place.
Kajal came to leave her here.

207
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,383
He had come along with her.

208
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:13,790
That night they had a quarrel.

209
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,989
I found out how they had trapped you.

210
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:21,933
I had warned Kajal
about Bhagwat Singh.

211
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,867
He is a devil!

212
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:28,670
Shall I tell you something?
- Sure.

213
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:32,043
If need be, will you help me?
- Why not?

214
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,648
I'm indebted to you.

215
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:39,584
And since they falsely implicated
you, it's my duty to help you.

216
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:45,084
Sister, he is right.
We did trap him.

217
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:48,754
But how can he prove it?
- He doesn't want to.

218
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:52,799
He's blood-thirsty!
He wants to take revenge.

219
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:56,460
Sister?!
- Take care.

220
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:57,594
Bye!

221
00:26:58,273 --> 00:26:59,900
Listen, sister...

222
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:07,177
Amrit has been released.
Let's get away from here. Please!

223
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,783
He was sentenced for 2 years.
It's not even 1 year yet.

224
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:13,718
My sister says he is out.
He wants to take revenge.

225
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,187
He is coming for us.
Let's get out of here. Please!

226
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:18,258
Scared? What for?

227
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:22,358
I have left my job.
And I've changed my appearance.

228
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,794
He doesn't have any evidence
against us.

229
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:28,802
B. K, It was fun when you thrust
the blame on him.

230
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,734
But I am scared now!

231
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:34,000
Let's get out of here.
I'm scared of bloodshed!

232
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:39,142
If you love me, please listen to me.

233
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:43,808
All right. Even I'm bored out here.

234
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:46,182
Pack up. We will move out
for a few days.

235
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,287
Didn't you tell Shabnam
that you did trap me...

236
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:57,160
but I don't have
any evidence against you?

237
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,290
You were wrong.
I have evidence.

238
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:02,029
What evidence?
- A tape recorder.

239
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:06,330
The conversation which went on in
this room is recorder in this tape.

240
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,247
Give me the tape!

241
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:20,848
Any other evidences?

242
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,057
You want the tape?

243
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,178
Hold it.

244
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,454
Touch the tape
and you lose your life.

245
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,162
You shot Luska!

246
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:39,192
You will be hanged for this!

247
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,487
Sit here, my dear son.
- Great! The train is on time.

248
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:09,118
Take this.

249
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,961
The lower berths are ours, isn't it?
- Yes.

250
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,563
Wake him up.

251
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,035
Poor fellow! He looks tired.
Let him sleep.

252
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:23,906
I'll sleep up there.
- What's the use of reservation?

253
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:26,605
I'll call the conductor.
- Come on!

254
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:29,514
Your name is Juhi. (Juhi = Jasmine)
And you get worked up? Be soft.

255
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:31,313
I'll wake him up.
Right away.

256
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:46,122
Vijay?

257
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:56,208
He is the one... Amrit.

258
00:30:56,344 --> 00:31:00,337
With whose talks I have bored you
a hundred times over.

259
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:04,050
She is Juhi. Your sister-in-law.

260
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,088
Mrs Juhi Vijay Kumar Gupta.

261
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:10,086
On time.

262
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:15,556
Rascal! Laughing? He seems to have
inherited your sense of humor.

263
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:19,594
Juhi, your husband is
an awfully decent man!

264
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,562
A matchless Prankster!

265
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,367
Naughty!

266
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:29,108
Let the song play. Sweet voice.

267
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:31,337
What? Rubbish!

268
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,338
Don't you dare insult
my father's voice!

269
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:37,443
Don't feel bad. It's habitual of him.

270
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:43,787
Come on! Don't disturb us.
- It's all right. Nice song.

271
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:49,420
Her father's few photographs and
his songs were what I got in dowry.

272
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:53,728
Which is why I rarely play this song.
It's a treasure.

273
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:56,803
Meaning?
- Actually, I fell for her.

274
00:31:56,938 --> 00:32:02,740
Her father screamed: How dare a broke
fall for my daughter?

275
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:07,871
I felt hurt. Then he told her
to forget me.

276
00:32:08,016 --> 00:32:10,576
Juhi retorted that it's not possible.

277
00:32:10,718 --> 00:32:13,152
He got into a movie fit.

278
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:17,691
Said, "Vijay doesn't love you.
He's in love with my bank balance."

279
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,890
Juhi bid adieu to him
and his bank balance.

280
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,157
She came to me. And we married.

281
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,288
Just a minute.

282
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,902
I am well versed with my
honorable father-in-law's picture.

283
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:31,402
Here. Take a look.

284
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:34,598
Handsome, isn't he?
- Yes.

285
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:38,309
It means, you haven't met him yet?
- No way!

286
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:39,402
He refuses to see even my picture.

287
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,249
With high hopes one day
I got my picture clicked.

288
00:32:43,384 --> 00:32:47,184
I pleaded with her to send it to him.
So that my looks could melt him.

289
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:48,914
But she wouldn't relent.

290
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,123
And this song is
his most cherished song.

291
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,091
Which is why I resent it.

292
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:56,992
Why did you sing it to your friends
on your last birthday...

293
00:32:57,132 --> 00:32:59,794
when you really resent it?

294
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:03,392
It was just to enliven
India's Independence day.

295
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:04,698
Liar!

296
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:06,998
Don't you quarrel.
Let me hear the song.

297
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:09,942
I'll tell you if it is meant for the
Independence day, or his birthday.

298
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:12,842
He used to boast that the holiday
given on the Independence day...

299
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:14,677
was in celebration
of his birthday.

300
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:16,375
Play it please.

301
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,059
Wonderful!

302
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:46,401
"So what if life is short?"
We are large hearted"

303
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:48,297
Great!

304
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,577
Vijay, it's a lovely song.

305
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:54,574
What about you?
Where were you for so long.

306
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,877
Where are you going?
What are you doing nowadays?

307
00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:01,052
I am... forget me.
Tell me, where are you going?

308
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,521
To touch my father-in-law's feet.
In anticipation of his blessings.

309
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,626
You said, he doesn't accept you...
- Just a minute.

310
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,526
All for my junior's charisma.

311
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:17,402
I sent him junior's picture.
He was bewitched.

312
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,233
And yearned to see his grandson.

313
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:23,139
I told Juhi let him yearn
for some more time.

314
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:25,610
But a daughter she is.
Her heart melted.

315
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,146
And we packed our bags.

316
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:30,373
Now, I am on the way
to my father-in-law's place.

317
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,885
Look at him, Kamla...
he resembles me!

318
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:40,461
Not you, brother. His eyes is
just like his grandmother's.

319
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:44,892
Once he comes,
this house will be full of life.

320
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,090
Without kids the house
looks so lifeless.

321
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:48,759
We have Jaggu here.

322
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:52,896
Come on! I wouldn't mind,
If he were a little smart.

323
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,507
Children inherit good qualities.
But he has inherited...

324
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,044
his father foolishness.
- Hello, uncle!

325
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,908
Hi! Come.

326
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:06,677
What are you sniffing at?
- My late father was an adept sniffer.

327
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:11,053
I'm somewhat good at it.
You were surely complaining about me.

328
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:12,853
Come on Jaggu! Forget it.

329
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,258
Look at the picture.
- All right. Now?

330
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,729
Doesn't he resemble me?

331
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:21,858
No way! My late father
used to resemble his father.

332
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:24,733
Shut up, Jaggu!
- How can I be sure, mother?

333
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,138
Have I seen uncle naked
in a bath tub?

334
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,732
Shut up! You talk nonsense.

335
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,003
Don't you know how to talk to elders?

336
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:35,081
Jaggu, you move. I sense your stars
are not in favour.

337
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:38,549
Move? My late father...
- Move! Else, I'll slap you.

338
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,420
He is a pretty jolly type.
Why do you have to scold him?

339
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:45,355
What else do I do?
Should I pamper him like a child?

340
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,553
Makhanlal? Where were you?

341
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:52,223
Find out if the train is on time.
It's a very special train for me!

342
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:56,201
My daughter, my son-in-law and my
grandson are coming!

343
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:59,902
What's wrong with you?
Why are you silent?

344
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:02,770
Calamity has befallen, Sir!
- What calamity?

345
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:07,213
The train in which Juhi was coming...
- What happened to it?!

346
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:11,280
An accident! We lost them.

347
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,386
No!

348
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:17,048
Tell me it's not true, Makhanlal!

349
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,290
How can you say that?

350
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:28,864
How can you say that, Makhanlal?

351
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:32,867
Is it true?

352
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,107
Sir!

353
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:54,889
Brother!
- Sir!

354
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:57,559
Accountant, call the doctor. Quick!

355
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:59,230
Oh my god!

356
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,841
Doctor, his wife was with him
in the same compartment.

357
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:19,242
She's my sister-in-law.
Please find her!

358
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:22,681
Come with me.

359
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:28,148
See if you can find her here.

360
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:32,853
I think she had worn this dress.

361
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:39,156
No! Please don't look at her.
She is badly burnt!

362
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:25,507
The B.P. Is all right.
Some problem with the cardiogram.

363
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,675
Mr Sinha, you have to be
very careful now.

364
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:34,788
It was your second heart attack.
And a very vigorous one.

365
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:51,337
Sorry, uncle! I'll smoke outside.
It's prohibited inside, right?

366
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,633
Listen...
- What should I listen to, sir?

367
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:57,269
My late father was adept at it.

368
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:02,546
He...
- My god! Come here. This kid...

369
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:07,052
The kid in the tub is in your arms?

370
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:08,746
Listen to me. Please!

371
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:13,019
I am deaf.
I used to tell my uncle that...

372
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,688
the Almighty is not a bandit
to rob us of all the happiness.

373
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:21,766
By the way,
I'm Jaganath Prasad Srivastav.

374
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:25,497
Mr Srivastav, this kid...
- How can I be a Mister?

375
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,442
My late father used to be one.
Top to bottom... Mr Srivastav.

376
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,776
Listen... look at his condition.
- I can't listen. I am deaf.

377
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:36,712
Completely deaf!

378
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,775
Uncle, come downstairs.

379
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:42,912
Brother-in-law has come with Munna.
Come quickly.

380
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:45,121
Mr Sinha! Listen...

381
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:49,792
Brother-in-law has come with Munna!
- I'm not your brother-in-law.

382
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:55,197
The kid! You almost killed me
with the false news.

383
00:41:55,336 --> 00:41:57,304
My child! Come.

384
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:59,929
Don't cry. I am your grandfather.

385
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:03,065
00 Where is Juhi? Juhi.

386
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,444
I came to tell you that Juhi is!

387
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:15,887
It's all right. I understood.

388
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:21,387
God saved you. He saved the kid.

389
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:26,162
But he took Juhi!

390
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:30,393
Kamla, god didn't forgive me!

391
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:36,166
Son, she is Juhi's aunt. Kamla.

392
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:40,910
Mr Sinha, the thing is...
- Not Sinha!

393
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:44,175
Call me Daddy.
- Daddy?

394
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,514
How can I call you daddy?

395
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:50,920
I'm just a stranger.
I'm not even related to you.

396
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:55,119
The kid is your blood.
I just came to hand him over to you.

397
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:58,091
Relationships have to be built.
Forget about the past.

398
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,928
Make him understand, doctor.

399
00:43:01,068 --> 00:43:05,334
Juhi is dead! Does it mean you
don't have any relationship with us?

400
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,201
Try to understand. I am...

401
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,740
Let me explain.

402
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:12,869
Doctor, there's a misunderstanding.

403
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,213
My love!

404
00:43:16,717 --> 00:43:20,084
There's a misunderstanding. I am...
- I am just the family doctor.

405
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:22,018
And I don't have any right
in his family matters.

406
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:25,887
I am...
- But as a doctor I inform you that...

407
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:29,757
he has suffered two heart attacks.
If he experiences a third...

408
00:43:29,897 --> 00:43:32,764
there's a risk to his life.
- What can I do about it?

409
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,963
If you remain obstinate...
I think he's due for the third.

410
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:43,566
Try to understand me. I am...
- You try to understand me!

411
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:46,179
If you go away,
he'll die out of grief.

412
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:48,781
If you really want
to kill him, you can go.

413
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,384
But doctor, I'm not related to him
in any way. And Juhi...

414
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:54,781
Forget the past.

415
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:58,756
Won't you stay here for some time
to save a life?

416
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:06,297
All right. If that's the price
I have to pay...

417
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:09,868
to save Mr Sinha's life, then...
- Not Mr Sinha. Daddy!

418
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:15,198
Go to him. Go.

419
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,214
Kamla, try to pacify him.

420
00:44:27,888 --> 00:44:29,287
I'm not going anywhere.

421
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:33,023
How can I leave you alone
in this situation?

422
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,184
My son!

423
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:47,066
Hello!

424
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:48,903
Is everything all right?
- Perfect.

425
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,569
Come, I'll show you
the bottling department.

426
00:44:55,182 --> 00:44:58,777
This is the final stage.
The juice is bottled here.

427
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,887
Then it reaches here.

428
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:03,719
It is exported
after it is labeled here.

429
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:05,849
Sir, you? Here?

430
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:08,721
I came to see you.
- Why take the trouble?

431
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,854
You could've called me
to the office.

432
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:13,195
I don't take you to be an employee,
but a family member.

433
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,359
He is Makhanlal.

434
00:45:15,502 --> 00:45:16,799
And he's my son-in-law.

435
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:19,203
I swear by his sincerity
and faithfulness.

436
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:24,677
You embarrass me, Sir!
I live off you.

437
00:45:24,812 --> 00:45:27,303
I'll introduce you to his son.
He's a very diligent fellow.

438
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:30,646
Why do you trouble yourself.
Take some rest in the office.

439
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:32,081
I'll introduce him.

440
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:33,881
Go.
- Come.

441
00:45:38,893 --> 00:45:43,262
He is my son. Prem.
Very talented and hard-working.

442
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:47,731
Always on the move.
Even forgets his food.

443
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:52,094
Prem, he is Vijay.
Mr Sinha's son-in-law.

444
00:45:54,675 --> 00:45:57,109
My love! Have some biscuits.

445
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,849
Rashmi!

446
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:20,832
I cried a lot. But tears won't
give us your sister back.

447
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:23,195
You should've at least informed me.

448
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:28,437
You informed me so late?
I got your letter just yesterday.

449
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:32,979
I didn't inform you earlier
because of your examinations.

450
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:38,884
In any case, the news of a sister's
death is never a thing of past.

451
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:47,384
I thank god for saving Vijay
and Munna from the accident!

452
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:50,394
Vijay is a gift of god.

453
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:53,894
I must've done some good deed
to have him by my side.

454
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:58,636
He is as good as my own son.

455
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:01,639
He has taken care of everything here.

456
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,766
He has made me sit idle.

457
00:47:05,546 --> 00:47:09,505
My grandson reminds me
of my daughters' childhood days.

458
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:13,146
I'll introduce you to Vijay. Come.

459
00:47:18,158 --> 00:47:20,251
Meet Rashmi. My daughter.
Your sister-in-law.

460
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:25,256
Hello!

461
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:30,996
Brother-in-law, we will talk later.

462
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:33,363
Come on Munna. We'll play.

463
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:45,080
Didn't you tell your grandfather
that this man is not your father?

464
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:48,581
Strange! You forget
your father's face?

465
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:50,212
Sit here. I'll show you...

466
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:01,931
Look. She's your mother... my sister.

467
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:03,535
And this is your father.

468
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:07,034
Come on, let's spill the beans.

469
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:10,167
I'll get your medicines.
- Come on! Sit down.

470
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:13,839
I don't need medicines.
You are my remedy.

471
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:17,844
Give me a dose,
a glimpse of you, every hour.

472
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:21,921
I must've done some good deeds
in my previous birth...

473
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:24,718
to get such a son-in-law!
- I am!

474
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:28,521
You have given me a new life!

475
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:30,391
Have your tea.

476
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:34,864
Munna, not the right time
to spill the beans.

477
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:39,603
Let's wait and watch. If he is a
fraud, he must be eying the money.

478
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,868
Your grandfather's life
is more precious than money.

479
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:47,174
Let him take the money.
But, we better keep a watch on him.

480
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:50,878
We are facing problems, buddy!

481
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:54,886
Since Vijay has taken charge,
it has become tough to swindle.

482
00:48:55,022 --> 00:48:58,082
But don't worry, tomorrow
4:30 sharp at Simla road...

483
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:01,160
I'll deliver you with a truckload.

484
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:04,923
Keep the money ready.
- We always keep it ready, Prem.

485
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:08,694
My man Lekuram will receive
you tomorrow.

486
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:09,825
All right.

487
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:25,847
Take this. I'll deliver
another tomorrow. Give me my dough.

488
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:27,248
Here.
- Whole amount? - Yes.

489
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:28,379
Mr Makhanlal...

490
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:31,256
Did you see your son's misdeeds?

491
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:34,357
God knows for how long
he's been doing this.

492
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:36,860
Son-of-a-gun!
- No, father!

493
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:40,725
You are my son?
How dare you do this act?

494
00:49:40,868 --> 00:49:42,358
I'll kill you!

495
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:45,862
Dog!

496
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,135
Ingrate! I have lost face
in front of Mr Sinha!

497
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:51,935
You have brought shame on me!

498
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,606
I'll kill you!
- Hold it.

499
00:49:57,117 --> 00:50:01,019
I won't reveal this to daddy.
But, warn him not to do this again.

500
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:04,016
I am ashamed of myself!

501
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:06,820
Don't tell Mr Sinha. Please!
- Take the truck back.

502
00:50:06,894 --> 00:50:08,156
I'll come by car.

503
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:13,896
Are you a father
or a butcher?

504
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:16,696
You took me for a dog! Would you hit
me, if my mother were to be alive?

505
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,964
Listen son...

506
00:50:18,105 --> 00:50:20,767
if I hadn't beaten you,
he would have suspected me.

507
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:24,036
That would have been the end
of our activities.

508
00:50:24,178 --> 00:50:26,976
Next time execute it carefully.

509
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:28,741
It hurts!
- Never mind.

510
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:29,907
Mother!

511
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,911
Where's your father? Find him.
- Sure.

512
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,853
Tell me why did you throw this party?
It's neither your birthday, nor mine.

513
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:43,861
Don't spoil my mood with questions.
I'll tell once everybody is in.

514
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:48,058
Everybody is in. Who's yet to come?
- Over there... you forgot him.

515
00:50:48,202 --> 00:50:50,363
What's the occasion?
No one told me about it.

516
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:53,099
I'm ignorant. Ask Rashmi.
It's her party.

517
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:55,798
Today's date, brother-in-law?
- 15th August.

518
00:50:55,943 --> 00:50:59,344
And please call me by my name.
"Brother-in-law" sounds outdated.

519
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,936
Daddy, tell her please.

520
00:51:01,982 --> 00:51:04,746
This party is for the
independence day, I guess?

521
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:08,880
Doesn't this day hold any
significance in your life?

522
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:11,524
What significance
would it hold for me?

523
00:51:11,825 --> 00:51:13,816
Tax your brains.

524
00:51:14,094 --> 00:51:16,995
Come on! Don't you trouble him.

525
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:21,759
No, daddy. I won't relent.
I'll make sure he recollects.

526
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,894
Remember something?

527
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,899
If you don't remember,
shall I tell today is?

528
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:34,909
It's my birthday today, but!

529
00:51:35,415 --> 00:51:37,110
Why didn't you tell us before?

530
00:51:41,221 --> 00:51:42,313
Wish him, dear.

531
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:49,925
Now let's hear the song
which you had sung...

532
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:51,928
on your last birthday.

533
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:56,960
Did I sing?
- Of course.

534
00:51:57,104 --> 00:52:00,938
My sister told me. Try to remember.

535
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,707
I can't. Forget it.
What difference does it make?

536
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:12,747
You forget your birthday.
And also the song.

537
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:15,047
I hope you haven't forgotten
your own identity?

538
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:17,884
Shall I tell you who you are?

539
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:21,888
The need won't arise.

540
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:27,094
You are troubling him too much!

541
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:33,966
Take this.

542
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:41,441
Juhi had written these letters to me.
After your wedding.

543
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:45,315
Since I was furious,
I never read them.

544
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,382
Perhaps, this unread letters
were anticipating you.

545
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:53,922
Now, I am relieved of worries.

546
00:56:54,198 --> 00:56:56,689
I need to talk to you. Sit down.

547
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:06,200
Son, earlier I felt like
you loved Juhi only for my wealth.

548
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:09,204
Today I feel that,
my feelings insulted you.

549
00:57:10,147 --> 00:57:14,208
I have to atone for it.
- Meaning?

550
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:18,478
I've decided to transfer
Juhi's properties to your name.

551
00:57:19,423 --> 00:57:21,186
No, daddy! I...
- Yes, son.

552
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:25,421
I have accepted you. And I trust you.
Juhi's soul will rest in peace now.

553
00:57:25,562 --> 00:57:29,157
I have never gone against your wish.
But I won't accept this.

554
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:32,164
Your intentions are enough
for Juhi's soul to rest in peace.

555
00:57:32,669 --> 00:57:35,229
I'm not the heir to her property.
But her son is.

556
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,239
If you don't agree...

557
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:41,173
I won't be able
to forgive myself all my life.

558
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:43,070
The decision is yours.

559
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:44,646
But daddy...

560
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:51,150
"Amrit, you had to stay here since it
was a question of Mr Sinha's life."

561
00:57:51,288 --> 00:57:54,189
"But, today he takes you for his
son-in-law. And wants to make you...

562
00:57:54,258 --> 00:57:56,123
the heir to Juhi's properties."

563
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:58,593
"What answers do you have
if your true identity is revealed...

564
00:57:58,662 --> 00:58:01,130
and he comes to know that
you not Vijay but Amrit... a killer?"

565
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:04,701
"It's better to leave it to destiny.
Tell him the truth and move out."

566
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:12,833
Come, Rashmi.

567
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,638
What are you staring at me for?

568
00:58:17,948 --> 00:58:21,509
I'm just trying to figure out
how cunning and fraudulent you are.

569
00:58:21,652 --> 00:58:25,816
You rendered my sister's favorite
song very beautifully.

570
00:58:25,956 --> 00:58:29,483
15th August is my brother-in-law's
birthday. Yours too!

571
00:58:30,294 --> 00:58:33,491
If you are Vijay... who is this?

572
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:40,163
He is Vijay. And I'm Amrit.

573
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:46,267
You must've somehow come to know
that daddy hadn't seen Vijay.

574
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,708
And you pretended to be Vijay
and came here...

575
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:50,371
to swindle him of his wealth?

576
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:52,239
Not true.

577
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:56,249
Where is my sister
and my brother-in-law?

578
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:58,718
They died in the train accident.
- You are lying.

579
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:04,690
Accident? Or, did you kill them
out of desire for wealth?

580
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:10,662
You are a fraud! A cunning fellow!
You are a killer too!

581
00:59:11,401 --> 00:59:14,268
Neither I am a fraud nor a killer!

582
00:59:14,404 --> 00:59:17,532
Vijay was my best friend.
And I didn't come here out of greed.

583
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:22,536
After their deaths, it was my duty
to reach the kid here.

584
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,478
When I came here,
your daddy took me for Vijay.

585
00:59:27,618 --> 00:59:30,143
Your family doctor
persuaded me to stay here.

586
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:33,814
He said, if I went, Mr Sinha's life
might be in danger.

587
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:39,153
If you still don't believe me,
read this letter.

588
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:41,287
I wrote it since I am quitting.

589
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:15,927
We have to carefully make our moves.

590
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:21,966
Vijay is a shrewd fellow.
Beware of him.

591
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:28,305
And the oldie is an heart patient.
He may pass out soon. On his own.

592
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:33,815
We have to kill the heir
to his properties... Juhi's son.

593
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:38,012
Next, you will be married to Rashmi.

594
01:00:38,155 --> 01:00:40,214
And the oldie's properties come to us.

595
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:41,346
Say what?

596
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:42,414
Come on.

597
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,568
What is this?
- Orange.

598
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:04,974
Is it? My late father
used to call it a rotten orange.

599
01:01:05,115 --> 01:01:10,178
Some old saint used
to call it an orange.

600
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,312
God knows what he used to eat.

601
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:17,826
But he was a saint after all.
And I'm the factory in-charge.

602
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:23,228
You peeled this orange?
You tried to insult me?

603
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,028
You have broken the company's
quality rules.

604
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:27,934
Come to my cabin.
- What?

605
01:01:28,005 --> 01:01:29,472
Come to my cabin.

606
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:31,803
You didn't break the rule
but my heart!

607
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:34,672
Come to my cabin.

608
01:01:34,811 --> 01:01:35,800
Coming.

609
01:01:41,685 --> 01:01:43,949
What is this, Jaggu?
Weren't you yelling at me?

610
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:47,151
And now!
- This is love!

611
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:49,156
My late father used to say that...

612
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:52,319
matters of love should be kept
in absolute secrecy.

613
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:57,832
Out there many flies were hindering.
So I whisked away my love.

614
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:00,528
Tara, the star of my life!
Where will you shine tonight?

615
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:02,366
I mean where will you meet me?

616
01:02:05,676 --> 01:02:07,974
What's the use in meeting you.

617
01:02:08,178 --> 01:02:12,171
You fired my father.
And messed up everything.

618
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,508
What else could I have done?
Had I fired myself?

619
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:20,555
He used to drink on duty. Why did you
make a drunkard your father?

620
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:22,454
I won't in my next birth.

621
01:02:23,927 --> 01:02:26,862
What about this birth?
- We'll get married.

622
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,727
He wants me to marry somebody else.
- Impossible!

623
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:33,461
Jaggu, you don't know my father!
- I know him.

624
01:02:33,603 --> 01:02:35,696
Try to get to know me.

625
01:02:36,873 --> 01:02:41,207
Jaggu, we're on duty.
- My beauty! You are very witty!

626
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:44,610
We meet by the lake in the evening.

627
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:46,807
By the lake. In the evening!
- All right.

628
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:53,949
Hey, one more bottle here.

629
01:02:54,157 --> 01:02:57,024
This isn't an orphanage.
This is a a wine shop.

630
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,253
Money first.
- You ask money from me?

631
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:04,834
Don't you know who I am?
- How will he know? I know you.

632
01:03:05,168 --> 01:03:09,366
Who doesn't know that
you are Tara's father?

633
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:15,301
Just a minute, Mr Banwarilal.

634
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:19,711
Only one path leads to free booze.
You have to take it.

635
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,843
I will.
- Patience.

636
01:03:23,987 --> 01:03:25,978
Give me Tara's hand in marriage.

637
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:29,251
And you'll have free booze
for all your life.

638
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:32,190
Free booze? All my life?!
- Right.

639
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:34,490
But make a decision
at the earliest.

640
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:38,192
Why?
- Because, Jaggu might whisk her away.

641
01:03:38,335 --> 01:03:40,200
Jaggu might whisk her away?
- Yes.

642
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:46,570
Shambu is head over heels after me.
Father will marry me off to him.

643
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,337
Think of something.

644
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:56,145
What do I think of?
My late father was adept in it.

645
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:00,489
Father is here!
- Your late father?

646
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:03,559
No. Your living father!
Come on, into the waters.

647
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,360
Father! We are done for! Quick!

648
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:10,159
Jaggu and Tara!

649
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,161
What? Jaggu and Tara?

650
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:17,438
I have caught them. At last!

651
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:25,304
Father?
- Where is he?

652
01:04:26,316 --> 01:04:28,113
Who?
- That stupid Jaggu.

653
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:29,443
Jaggu? Who?

654
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:32,248
The one who jumped with you
in the water.

655
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:34,150
I was bathing alone.

656
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,159
You are high. Go home and sleep.

657
01:04:39,162 --> 01:04:42,154
Yes. I think I am high.

658
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:52,170
Jaggu! You?

659
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:54,833
Fish!

660
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,039
Hello, Mr Banwarilal!

661
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:02,047
Where is she?
- Who? - Tara.

662
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:04,717
Tara? At daytime?
(Tara = Star)

663
01:05:04,855 --> 01:05:08,313
Oh god! She was right there
in the water with you.

664
01:05:09,092 --> 01:05:13,051
Shame on you!
You ask a young man...

665
01:05:13,196 --> 01:05:17,257
where your young and
unmarried daughter is?

666
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,063
Which is why I tell you not to booze.
No time is lost yet. Improve!

667
01:05:21,204 --> 01:05:23,798
Go home.

668
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:30,003
My eyes are deceiving me.
They are playing games with me.

669
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,814
You are still here? Go home.

670
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:41,820
All right. I'm going.

671
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:49,791
Thank the water. It saved us.

672
01:05:49,866 --> 01:05:54,166
Thank the booze. It fooled him.
The oldie almost caught us!

673
01:05:55,005 --> 01:05:56,097
Statue!

674
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:02,341
First it was Tara. Then... Jaggu.

675
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:04,174
Now... both together.

676
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:09,184
Looks like I am very high on it.

677
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:14,781
Gone.

678
01:06:17,294 --> 01:06:19,125
Hello, Uncle!
- Hello, Sir!

679
01:06:19,195 --> 01:06:20,753
Hi! Come, Mr Makhanlal.

680
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:26,131
Help me out. I want to go for a ride.
She doesn't allow me.

681
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:29,204
She is right.
- Nonsense!

682
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,739
You aren't confident
of my riding skills?

683
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:34,366
That's why you don't want
to send Munna with me, isn't it?

684
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:36,945
Actually...
- I'll take him with me, uncle.

685
01:06:37,113 --> 01:06:40,549
You?
- He captained the University club.

686
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:44,215
Take him.
- Come on, Munna.

687
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,412
We'll go for a ride.

688
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:53,017
Shall we?

689
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,727
Wonderful! Rashmi and Prem
make a beautiful couple, don't they?

690
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:02,233
Couples are created in heaven.
- It's a limit, daddy.

691
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:05,406
Doctor is waiting to check your B.P.
And here you are chatting away. Come.

692
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:09,239
He would have gone
for riding but for me.

693
01:07:10,347 --> 01:07:12,247
Great!
- I know I can't.

694
01:07:12,349 --> 01:07:15,375
Which is why I sent Munna with Prem.

695
01:07:16,052 --> 01:07:17,314
Munna with Prem?
- Yes.

696
01:07:17,387 --> 01:07:19,446
He came here with his father
in his motorcycle.

697
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:25,991
Where are you going? Listen...

698
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:34,398
Slow down, Prem!

699
01:07:41,378 --> 01:07:43,471
What are you doing, Prem?
Munna may fall!

700
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:50,212
Stop! I say, stop!

701
01:08:05,635 --> 01:08:07,398
Hang on, Munna!

702
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,504
I am coming, Munna!

703
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,459
I am coming, Munna.

704
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:08,884
Munna! My love!

705
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:12,220
Are you hurt, Vijay?

706
01:10:23,173 --> 01:10:24,162
Look...

707
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:27,166
Get this thing clear.

708
01:10:27,844 --> 01:10:32,304
Hadn't daddy been a heart patient,
I would've briefed him...

709
01:10:32,448 --> 01:10:35,849
about yesterday's incident and kicked
you and Makhanlal out of this place.

710
01:10:37,387 --> 01:10:40,515
I want to save him
from your acts of disloyalty.

711
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:44,189
Which is precisely why I don't want
to see you in this house again.

712
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:46,461
You'll go
to the factory...

713
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:48,588
in the morning. And back to your
own house in the evening.

714
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,199
Brother-in-law...

715
01:10:58,107 --> 01:11:01,201
You will never be able
to become an uncle.

716
01:11:01,878 --> 01:11:04,073
Uncle? What do you mean?

717
01:11:04,214 --> 01:11:10,210
Banwarilal has fixed Tara's wedding
with Shambu, the liquor seller.

718
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:13,880
Tomorrow she gets married.
And you will see my dead body!

719
01:11:14,023 --> 01:11:17,424
Never. I'll see to it that
you are the one who marries her.

720
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:21,019
Me? How?

721
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:27,160
Hail Lord Shiva!

722
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:33,038
Halt!

723
01:11:33,176 --> 01:11:35,167
Halt the procession.

724
01:11:36,446 --> 01:11:37,708
Shut up!

725
01:11:37,847 --> 01:11:38,973
Halt!

726
01:11:39,249 --> 01:11:41,046
Silence!
- Hey, who are you?

727
01:11:41,117 --> 01:11:44,382
Hey? How dare you insult
the girl's uncle?

728
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,112
I'll take my brother to task.

729
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:48,555
How dare he seek alliance
with illiterate fools?

730
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:51,057
Forgive me, uncle!
I didn't recognize you.

731
01:11:51,194 --> 01:11:52,183
Bless me.

732
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:54,922
Croaked while on the horse,
didn't you? Get up.

733
01:11:55,064 --> 01:11:59,262
Come with me. Without the blessings
of our family's religious teacher...

734
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:04,305
the procession should not reach
the bride's door.

735
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:07,069
Else, calamity strikes!
- Show me the way, sir.

736
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,872
Follow me.

737
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,214
Everyone comes with me.

738
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:19,081
Everyone stands here. I'll take
Shambu in for the blessings.

739
01:12:19,222 --> 01:12:20,416
Come sonny.

740
01:12:21,357 --> 01:12:22,824
Stay put everybody.

741
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,418
Don't be afraid, dear.

742
01:12:26,362 --> 01:12:29,661
Hail lord Shiva!
- Bless me.

743
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,358
Hail Lord Shiva!

744
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,035
What's the matter, son?

745
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:39,164
He is the would-be bridegroom
to my niece.

746
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:42,676
I brought him for your blessings.

747
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:47,381
Blessings, sonny.

748
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:51,850
Water.

749
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:56,918
Wash my feet.

750
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,393
Uncle?!
- Wash them. You'll be blessed.

751
01:13:04,267 --> 01:13:07,964
Drink the water.

752
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:10,004
Uncle?!
- Drink it. - Should I?

753
01:13:10,073 --> 01:13:11,199
Never refuse.

754
01:13:14,277 --> 01:13:16,677
Anything for you, Tara.

755
01:13:18,147 --> 01:13:21,173
Bravo! You'll be blessed.

756
01:13:23,353 --> 01:13:24,445
He's blessed!

757
01:13:26,356 --> 01:13:27,823
Greetings!

758
01:13:28,858 --> 01:13:30,553
Congratulations!

759
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,093
Touch his feet.

760
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:33,423
Thank you.

761
01:13:33,563 --> 01:13:34,655
Congratulations!

762
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,323
I am Shambu's uncle.

763
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:43,861
It's a practice with us
to offer sweets to the bridegroom...

764
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,441
before the wedding.
- Sure. Go ahead.

765
01:13:47,343 --> 01:13:51,040
It means you will see his face.
- Yes.

766
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,375
There's a hitch.

767
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:57,384
Actually, earlier when I got
two of my nephews married...

768
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,253
their fathers-in-law happened
to see their faces.

769
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:04,326
And the fathers-in-law
died the next day.

770
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,055
I don't want a man like you to die.

771
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:11,064
No way.
- Find me a way out.

772
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,862
There is a way. It's in my pocket.
- In your pocket?

773
01:14:14,003 --> 01:14:16,437
Cover your face with this.

774
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,033
Sweet?
- Here.

775
01:14:22,078 --> 01:14:24,342
Where's his mouth?

776
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:29,641
He cut my finger!

777
01:14:29,952 --> 01:14:34,150
It tasted sweet
than the sweet you offered.

778
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:37,683
Shambu, what's wrong with your voice?

779
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:41,358
Actually, he's overwhelmed with joy.
- Exactly.

780
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:43,490
Uncle.
- Dose?

781
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,632
Let the children enjoy.
We'll take a break.

782
01:14:48,771 --> 01:14:51,968
A break? Sure.
- To the corner please.

783
01:14:52,108 --> 01:14:54,372
They take a break.
And I eat the cake. Wedding!

784
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:04,351
The wedding is over.
Bless the girl.

785
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:07,183
Let's go.
- Sure.

786
01:15:24,474 --> 01:15:29,810
This must be Jaggu's handiwork.
I'll show him.

787
01:15:30,947 --> 01:15:32,642
Open the door, Banwarilal.

788
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:37,445
Who is it?
- Shambu.

789
01:15:38,354 --> 01:15:41,812
Shambu? Why have you come here?
- To marry.

790
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,892
To marry? Tara is married.

791
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,825
With whom?
- With you.

792
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:48,328
What nonsense?
I am not yet married.

793
01:15:48,464 --> 01:15:50,091
Who was he then?

794
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:53,294
It was me, father-in-law.
- What?

795
01:15:53,436 --> 01:15:55,370
I can never be your father-in-law!

796
01:15:55,505 --> 01:15:59,965
But, you've become one.
- Yes, father. We are married.

797
01:16:00,109 --> 01:16:02,236
I'll nullify this marriage!

798
01:16:02,378 --> 01:16:08,317
Lmpossible. We already enjoyed
our nuptial night.

799
01:16:08,451 --> 01:16:11,045
Didn't we, Tara?
- He's right, brother Shambu.

800
01:16:11,187 --> 01:16:14,850
Brother? Hear that?
- Hear this too.

801
01:16:14,924 --> 01:16:16,858
By now The Almighty must be
contemplating...

802
01:16:16,926 --> 01:16:18,416
to make you a grandfather...

803
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:22,362
and you an uncle.

804
01:16:22,498 --> 01:16:24,489
Grandfather!
- Uncle!

805
01:16:29,138 --> 01:16:32,369
What's this entry of 56,000 for?
- Tractor. For our plant in Badlapur.

806
01:16:34,944 --> 01:16:37,276
Then, what does this entry
of 56,000 account for?

807
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:41,349
For the tractor's transport,
its spare parts, double tires...

808
01:16:41,484 --> 01:16:43,884
56,000 for such trivial things?

809
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:48,155
Uncle, I need to talk to him.
Could you please leave us alone?

810
01:16:48,224 --> 01:16:50,454
Wait, Mr Makhanlal.
Rashmi, I'm checking the accounts.

811
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:53,893
I'll crosscheck the entries.
- Wait... - It can wait.

812
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:57,226
What's the matter?

813
01:16:58,234 --> 01:16:59,223
Actually...

814
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:01,903
I feel shy to say it!

815
01:17:02,505 --> 01:17:07,169
I love a boy. I'm head over heels
in love with him.

816
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,240
The boy too seems
to have fallen for me.

817
01:17:16,452 --> 01:17:19,649
I want you to see him.
I want your opinion.

818
01:17:20,323 --> 01:17:22,257
How does my opinion matter?

819
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:29,058
I am blinded by his love.
I like his every move.

820
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,464
I really can't see through him.

821
01:17:33,603 --> 01:17:36,401
You don't want me to marry
any Tom Dick and Harry, do you?

822
01:17:37,006 --> 01:17:39,065
Can't you do this favour for me?

823
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:42,177
Meet him. Just once. Please!

824
01:17:42,345 --> 01:17:44,609
Strange! He hasn't come yet.

825
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:48,410
But...
- You use a lot of ifs and buts.

826
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:51,418
Life is far beyond the limits
of ifs and buts.

827
01:17:52,088 --> 01:17:54,488
But Rashmi...
- No ifs and buts.

828
01:17:54,624 --> 01:17:57,388
Say something else.
It might turn out to be interesting.

829
01:17:57,526 --> 01:18:00,222
But Rashmi, I...
- There you go again!

830
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,293
I just want to tell you that...

831
01:18:03,432 --> 01:18:06,094
I'll meet your boyfriend if he comes.
And I'll talk to your daddy about it.

832
01:18:06,235 --> 01:18:08,726
You'll be happy
to see him, won't you?

833
01:18:10,906 --> 01:18:13,374
Fool! Don't you understand?

834
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:15,238
You are the one.

835
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,139
No Rashmi.

836
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:25,454
My past is marred.

837
01:18:26,922 --> 01:18:28,446
Life holds no future for me.

838
01:18:28,524 --> 01:18:30,719
I know everything about you.

839
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,526
The letters you had written
to daddy are still with me.

840
01:18:36,532 --> 01:18:40,696
And I knew you were Amrit.
Not Vijay.

841
01:18:43,506 --> 01:18:45,997
Even then you didn't?
- Firstly, due to daddy.

842
01:18:46,475 --> 01:18:48,136
He was so happy
with you by his side...

843
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,201
that I couldn't utter
a single word against you.

844
01:18:53,549 --> 01:18:55,414
Then I fell in love with you.

845
01:18:56,552 --> 01:18:58,213
How about you?

846
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,554
I love you, too.

847
01:19:05,027 --> 01:19:06,551
But I am afraid
to make a promise.

848
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:11,356
I feel, for how long will you be able
to carry on with a person like me!

849
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:13,567
Till my last breath!

850
01:19:15,104 --> 01:19:17,436
What if I fall in your estimation?

851
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:21,840
Crazy! You are unaware
of the qualities you possess!

852
01:23:33,362 --> 01:23:35,387
Where were you?
- What happened, daddy?

853
01:23:35,464 --> 01:23:37,489
There's a surprise for both of you.

854
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:39,500
What is it?
- I won't reveal it for free.

855
01:23:39,568 --> 01:23:40,557
Reward first.

856
01:23:43,172 --> 01:23:44,434
Juhi is alive!

857
01:23:47,142 --> 01:23:48,473
Really?
- Yes.

858
01:23:49,945 --> 01:23:50,934
Wait.

859
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:54,844
It's her husband's right
to meet her first.

860
01:23:55,317 --> 01:23:56,306
Come.

861
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:02,248
Daughter.

862
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:03,380
Sister!

863
01:24:07,062 --> 01:24:09,394
Look who is here.

864
01:24:12,468 --> 01:24:14,698
Didn't I tell you
your husband is alive?

865
01:24:22,911 --> 01:24:26,142
Recognize him.
He is Vijay. Your husband.

866
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:31,146
No! He's not my husband!

867
01:24:32,855 --> 01:24:34,345
He's not my husband!

868
01:24:38,927 --> 01:24:41,623
I wanted to tell you...
- Don't you lose heart.

869
01:24:42,398 --> 01:24:46,164
She even failed to recognize me.
- And her child too.

870
01:24:46,402 --> 01:24:50,031
Actually, she has lost her memory.

871
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,298
What?
- Yes.

872
01:24:52,574 --> 01:24:55,168
I found my daughter.
But in this condition!

873
01:24:56,712 --> 01:25:01,979
She recognizes only her doctor.
And only heeds to him.

874
01:25:02,451 --> 01:25:05,784
That noble man somehow managed
to talk to her into coming here.

875
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:07,580
Doctor, where have you brought me?

876
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:12,388
Everyone here wants to build
a relationship with me.

877
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:14,594
Somebody says
he's my father!

878
01:25:15,464 --> 01:25:16,863
Somebody says
she is my sister!

879
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,195
And they say he is my husband!

880
01:25:29,144 --> 01:25:30,338
You?

881
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:36,279
So, you are Juhi's husband?

882
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,978
Glad to meet you!

883
01:25:47,429 --> 01:25:50,296
Everyone might be eager
to find out...

884
01:25:50,432 --> 01:25:54,300
why and how I reached
the spot of the accident?

885
01:25:54,436 --> 01:25:59,373
And how did I find Juhi
in this condition?

886
01:26:00,175 --> 01:26:06,842
I was in my car. The accident
occurred in front of my eyes.

887
01:26:09,184 --> 01:26:14,383
I saw a lady wandering alone.
I stopped my car.

888
01:26:16,859 --> 01:26:17,848
Hey you...

889
01:26:20,462 --> 01:26:21,861
Do you wish to die?

890
01:26:31,406 --> 01:26:33,203
"My dear daughter Juhi."

891
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:37,206
"Come back to me with your husband."

892
01:26:39,214 --> 01:26:43,207
"Money in millions cannot substitute
for your love."

893
01:26:43,952 --> 01:26:44,941
Millions?

894
01:26:46,455 --> 01:26:48,446
What's your father's name?
Where do you stay?

895
01:26:48,524 --> 01:26:50,515
What's his name? Speak.
- I can't recollect.

896
01:26:52,127 --> 01:26:54,095
Speak. What's his name.

897
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:55,526
Don't beat me.
Please!

898
01:26:57,032 --> 01:27:01,230
I don't remember anything.
I'm trying hard to recollect.

899
01:27:02,504 --> 01:27:03,903
I don't remember anything.

900
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:07,430
Come along.

901
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:09,232
Come on!

902
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,513
I felt it wasn't right to leave
this girl on her own.

903
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:18,250
Which is why I took her to my home.

904
01:27:19,454 --> 01:27:21,217
I gave her treatment.

905
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:26,521
But I failed to bring
her memory back.

906
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:31,990
She was a stranger to me.
A girl void of identity.

907
01:27:32,134 --> 01:27:35,297
Just think, how much of a dilemma
she was to me!

908
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:40,840
But doctor, had you advertised,
her family...

909
01:27:40,976 --> 01:27:42,739
I mean... we would've come
to take her.

910
01:27:42,911 --> 01:27:48,008
You are right. I had considered it.
But then I backed out.

911
01:27:49,218 --> 01:27:53,882
Because, if I had advertised
her picture...

912
01:27:54,022 --> 01:27:56,286
a whole lot of impostors
would have sprung up.

913
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:58,518
Father. Sister.

914
01:27:59,428 --> 01:28:00,554
And... husband!

915
01:28:00,696 --> 01:28:03,426
And everyone isn't straight
like you, Mr Vijay.

916
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:08,499
Mr Sinha, I know of a person,
who after committing a murder...

917
01:28:08,637 --> 01:28:11,902
stayed with a family. He pretended
to be their close relative.

918
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:16,568
And vanished after a few days
with all their wealth.

919
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:21,206
But I couldn't gamble
with Juhi's life.

920
01:28:22,184 --> 01:28:26,985
Eventually, someone came to me...
he recognized Juhi.

921
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:30,958
In this way I got the link
to her existence.

922
01:28:31,093 --> 01:28:32,993
And I brought her over here.

923
01:28:33,061 --> 01:28:36,189
When will she get cured?

924
01:28:37,299 --> 01:28:40,291
You should ask Vijay for an answer.

925
01:28:40,435 --> 01:28:44,098
Isn't it because of him
that she left you?

926
01:28:44,806 --> 01:28:46,865
Yours was a love marriage, isn't it?

927
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:51,077
If you try to revive the past glories
of your married life...

928
01:28:51,213 --> 01:28:54,205
perhaps she might!

929
01:28:56,018 --> 01:29:00,216
Anyway, Mr Sinha, now that
I've brought your daughter back...

930
01:29:00,355 --> 01:29:02,516
I'll be leaving within a few days.

931
01:29:09,231 --> 01:29:11,222
I am feeling scared.

932
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:16,233
It's time for her sleep.

933
01:29:25,314 --> 01:29:27,782
Take these two pills.

934
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:31,181
You'll sleep well.
And you won't be scared.

935
01:29:32,688 --> 01:29:33,677
Take.

936
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:40,450
All right.

937
01:29:41,129 --> 01:29:42,528
Now go to sleep.

938
01:29:42,597 --> 01:29:45,191
Come on. Try to sleep.

939
01:29:45,334 --> 01:29:47,325
Just relax. Don't think of anything.

940
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:50,199
Try to sleep so that...

941
01:29:52,407 --> 01:29:54,602
What is this?
- Medicine. Give it back.

942
01:29:55,477 --> 01:29:59,504
What is this for?
- Listen kid, don't irritate me.

943
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:04,483
For our own good it is important
that her memory doesn't return.

944
01:30:04,619 --> 01:30:08,385
As long as I continue to give
her the pills, it won't return.

945
01:30:08,523 --> 01:30:10,514
Take some pills for yourself.

946
01:30:10,659 --> 01:30:14,288
Believe me, it will help you forget
the bitterness between us.

947
01:30:14,429 --> 01:30:17,091
As it is, our destination
is the same, isn't it?

948
01:30:17,232 --> 01:30:19,564
Our destination was never the same...

949
01:30:19,701 --> 01:30:21,191
and never will be!

950
01:30:34,483 --> 01:30:36,178
What are you thinking?

951
01:30:38,754 --> 01:30:41,188
That I can't live
a double-faced life anymore.

952
01:30:42,357 --> 01:30:45,155
There's a limit to it. For how long
will I keep your father in the dark?

953
01:30:45,327 --> 01:30:47,591
Till the right time to reveal comes.

954
01:30:47,662 --> 01:30:51,063
Didn't you lie to save father's life?

955
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,324
Yes. I know that the danger
is yet to subside.

956
01:30:53,402 --> 01:30:56,064
I even know that he is not
in a position to hear me out.

957
01:30:56,204 --> 01:30:58,001
But when will the time come?

958
01:30:58,173 --> 01:31:00,801
Not until Juhi frees out
of the fraud doctor's web.

959
01:31:00,942 --> 01:31:04,309
And not until daddy recovers. Please!

960
01:31:07,115 --> 01:31:09,208
I hate to see tears in your eyes.

961
01:31:10,218 --> 01:31:13,346
Your eyes are meant to dream
about our future.

962
01:31:15,824 --> 01:31:18,019
Dreams in which there's no shades
of separation in it.

963
01:31:21,563 --> 01:31:24,123
Splendid! What a scene!

964
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:26,996
The crazy sister is shut inside.

965
01:31:27,069 --> 01:31:29,560
And the younger one is busy romancing
with her brother-in-law!

966
01:31:29,704 --> 01:31:30,830
How dare you?

967
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:36,238
What did you say?
- I'll put it the other way round.

968
01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:38,539
The crazy wife is shut inside!

969
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,046
And her husband is busy romancing
his sister-in-law!

970
01:31:42,517 --> 01:31:45,042
Insolent! Dare misbehave again, and
you won't get to enter this house.

971
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:46,176
Get it?

972
01:31:47,789 --> 01:31:48,915
Let's go, Vijay.

973
01:32:03,205 --> 01:32:05,435
What's wrong? You aren't eating.
You look worried.

974
01:32:06,274 --> 01:32:09,539
I am worried about Juhi.

975
01:32:10,412 --> 01:32:14,815
She doesn't recognize any of us.
And this doctor wants to leave.

976
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,077
Let him go.
We'll consult another doctor.

977
01:32:17,152 --> 01:32:23,887
No. You know, she's always hovering
about him like a frightened child.

978
01:32:25,227 --> 01:32:28,162
Till she gets cured
we have to prevent him from going.

979
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:35,034
Here's a cheque of 100,000.
Give it to him.

980
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:37,297
And somehow stop him.

981
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:39,964
100,000?
- Money doesn't matter.

982
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:42,168
It's a question of Juhi's life!

983
01:32:45,447 --> 01:32:46,436
All right.

984
01:32:47,382 --> 01:32:50,977
100,000? Your life is so cheap?

985
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:53,314
Mr Sinha has sent
you the cheque. Not me.

986
01:32:53,455 --> 01:32:58,358
Go away with it. Else, I tell him...
- That I'm not a doctor, right?

987
01:32:58,493 --> 01:32:59,653
Go ahead.

988
01:33:00,195 --> 01:33:02,129
So what if I'm not a doctor?

989
01:33:02,197 --> 01:33:05,360
I saved his daughter's life.
Whom he thought was dead.

990
01:33:06,201 --> 01:33:11,070
What if I tell him
about your true identity...

991
01:33:11,206 --> 01:33:14,198
that you are a murderer at large...

992
01:33:14,342 --> 01:33:18,938
and that the country's police
is after you?

993
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,638
What will you do?

994
01:33:20,715 --> 01:33:24,617
Get this clear!
Your life is in my hands.

995
01:33:24,753 --> 01:33:28,154
And I have the liberty
to play with it.

996
01:33:33,161 --> 01:33:34,150
Listen...

997
01:33:35,163 --> 01:33:37,028
But I won't do anything.

998
01:33:37,165 --> 01:33:41,261
We shouldn't fight with each other.
This house holds a lot of dough!

999
01:33:41,403 --> 01:33:48,832
When I need it, don't you try
to be a hurdle in my path.

1000
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:55,313
And in return,
I'll keep it a secret that...

1001
01:33:55,450 --> 01:34:00,183
Mr Sinha's genuine son-in-law
died in the accident.

1002
01:34:06,194 --> 01:34:09,061
Remember Bhagwat Singh,
you may send me to the gallows...

1003
01:34:09,197 --> 01:34:12,189
but, as long as I live I won't
allow you to swindle this house.

1004
01:34:21,343 --> 01:34:23,334
Juhi, hold him.

1005
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:28,146
Rascal! He recognizes his mother.

1006
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:31,482
Lovely child! Whose child is he?

1007
01:34:32,153 --> 01:34:33,142
Yours.

1008
01:34:36,324 --> 01:34:37,552
I don't have a child.

1009
01:34:39,394 --> 01:34:40,918
Nor am I anyone's daughter.

1010
01:34:41,463 --> 01:34:42,953
Tax your brains.

1011
01:34:43,431 --> 01:34:46,161
Look how much your sister
is worried for you.

1012
01:34:46,334 --> 01:34:48,165
Stop this nonsense.

1013
01:34:53,174 --> 01:34:56,166
Doctor, why are they harassing me?

1014
01:34:56,478 --> 01:34:58,969
Tell them I am not in any way
related to them.

1015
01:34:59,114 --> 01:35:02,515
All right. Go to your room.
And take rest. I'll handle them.

1016
01:35:08,256 --> 01:35:11,191
Doctor...
- Do you want her to go insane?

1017
01:35:11,326 --> 01:35:15,057
But...
- I understand your agony.

1018
01:35:15,196 --> 01:35:19,394
I am Juhi's doctor. I'm responsible
for her health and her life.

1019
01:35:19,534 --> 01:35:22,128
If you try to pressurize her
with love...

1020
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:25,364
and try to revive the past...
she'll surely go insane.

1021
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,803
All right, doctor.
We'll just do as you say.

1022
01:35:37,986 --> 01:35:39,647
I can't see Juhi suffer.

1023
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:45,217
Try to think positive, daddy.
We had taken Juhi to be dead.

1024
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:49,888
If we've got her back, she might
even get back her memory someday.

1025
01:35:50,065 --> 01:35:51,760
Allah willing!

1026
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,128
Hello, uncle Khan.

1027
01:35:53,268 --> 01:35:55,168
How are you? God bless you!
- Fine.

1028
01:35:56,171 --> 01:35:59,538
Sinha, I came here
to tell you that...

1029
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:02,040
my son Ali Khan has completed his
course in Psychiatry. From America.

1030
01:36:02,177 --> 01:36:04,111
He's about to return in a few days.

1031
01:36:04,179 --> 01:36:06,943
We'll entrust Juhi in his hands.

1032
01:36:08,183 --> 01:36:12,176
Secondly, don't forget to bring
Juhi and Vijay...

1033
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,255
to our club's annual celebrations
tomorrow night.

1034
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:18,188
Perhaps, taking her to a place
known to her before...

1035
01:36:18,326 --> 01:36:21,124
may revive her lost memories.

1036
01:36:21,196 --> 01:36:24,063
Uncle, you are right.
We'll surely bring her along.

1037
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:27,498
Remember, she was the beauty queen
of the club three years ago.

1038
01:36:29,204 --> 01:36:30,535
All right.
We'll be there.

1039
01:36:36,611 --> 01:36:39,205
Greetings, Mr Sinha!
- Greetings!

1040
01:36:44,486 --> 01:36:47,421
Recognize her? She is Aunt Khan.

1041
01:36:49,224 --> 01:36:50,953
It's been a long time
since we met.

1042
01:36:53,428 --> 01:36:56,158
He is Mr Pinto.
He was your piano teacher.

1043
01:36:56,231 --> 01:36:59,564
We used to climb trees to evade him.

1044
01:37:02,237 --> 01:37:04,899
Let me explain. Come.

1045
01:37:10,445 --> 01:37:12,436
Vijay, he is Mr Khan.

1046
01:37:12,547 --> 01:37:15,107
My son-in-law.
- God bless you, son.

1047
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:18,117
I'm called Vasi-ul-Hasan Khan.

1048
01:37:18,253 --> 01:37:22,053
Vijay, Rashmi tells me
you are a good singer.

1049
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:26,354
Enlighten the environment today.
- But...

1050
01:37:26,494 --> 01:37:30,123
Actually, I feel uneasy
since Juhi is unwell.

1051
01:37:30,265 --> 01:37:34,201
Sing, my dear.
Perhaps it may refresh her memories.

1052
01:37:35,403 --> 01:37:38,201
Who is Mr Vijay Kumar?
- He is.

1053
01:37:38,406 --> 01:37:40,203
Inspector Dube has come
for you from Bombay.

1054
01:37:44,212 --> 01:37:46,203
You have a guest. Receive him.

1055
01:42:28,162 --> 01:42:30,027
Inspector, I am Vijay.

1056
01:42:30,164 --> 01:42:32,632
I am ready to come with you.
- You don't have to.

1057
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:37,033
I come on behalf of Indian Railways.
Your wife escaped the accident.

1058
01:42:37,171 --> 01:42:38,365
Congratulations.

1059
01:42:38,506 --> 01:42:43,534
You have to fill the No Claim form.

1060
01:42:43,678 --> 01:42:46,169
So that there remains no claim
on the railways.

1061
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,846
Is that so?
- Yes.

1062
01:42:50,985 --> 01:42:52,976
My pleasure!

1063
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:55,615
One?
- Right.

1064
01:43:04,932 --> 01:43:06,923
What are you doing in my room?

1065
01:43:07,135 --> 01:43:11,572
Taking a look at it. It's attractive.

1066
01:43:11,706 --> 01:43:15,506
I have only one objection. The bed.

1067
01:43:16,711 --> 01:43:19,009
This is a double-bed.
Meant for two people, right?

1068
01:43:20,014 --> 01:43:21,879
But you are three.

1069
01:43:22,016 --> 01:43:26,612
You. Your wife.
And your sister-in-law.

1070
01:43:26,754 --> 01:43:29,154
Mind your tongue, B. K!
And get out of here!

1071
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:32,288
Don't raise your voice against me.
Understand?

1072
01:43:34,228 --> 01:43:36,162
After all, what do you want?

1073
01:43:37,031 --> 01:43:38,965
We had been friends before.

1074
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:41,931
In fact, I even let you go when
I caught you stealing red-handed.

1075
01:43:42,003 --> 01:43:43,698
Because your mother had cancer.

1076
01:43:43,805 --> 01:43:45,796
And you didn't have money
for her operation.

1077
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:48,465
But you thrust the blame on me.

1078
01:43:49,477 --> 01:43:51,172
Why are you after me?

1079
01:43:51,345 --> 01:43:53,176
What wrong have I done to you?

1080
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:59,017
You did the mistake
of trying to rape Luska.

1081
01:44:01,122 --> 01:44:04,455
What are you saying?
I regarded her as my sister.

1082
01:44:06,093 --> 01:44:07,082
Yes, B.K.

1083
01:44:13,334 --> 01:44:14,995
I was furious because of that.

1084
01:44:15,503 --> 01:44:19,462
I'm sorry friend,
I troubled you a lot.

1085
01:44:21,075 --> 01:44:24,340
But don't you worry. I'll relieve you
of all your troubles.

1086
01:44:25,146 --> 01:44:27,307
I'll testify before the law.

1087
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:31,145
I'll say that you didn't murder her,
but it was an accident.

1088
01:44:31,752 --> 01:44:34,277
I shall never forget your favour.

1089
01:44:34,422 --> 01:44:37,755
Favour? What favour?

1090
01:44:37,892 --> 01:44:41,760
I'll help you.
And in return you help me out.

1091
01:44:41,896 --> 01:44:43,557
Won't you?
- It's understood.

1092
01:44:43,631 --> 01:44:46,429
Should I tell you that I will?
- Not exactly.

1093
01:44:48,035 --> 01:44:49,161
But...

1094
01:44:51,372 --> 01:44:54,432
Give me 500,000.

1095
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:58,840
500,000?
- Yes. Think it over.

1096
01:44:59,513 --> 01:45:03,244
If you are interested to go
to the gallows, forget it.

1097
01:45:03,384 --> 01:45:05,249
Where do I bring
so much an amount from?

1098
01:45:05,386 --> 01:45:06,683
From the bank.

1099
01:45:07,688 --> 01:45:11,818
Tomorrow is pay day. And you will be
drawing 100,000 from the bank.

1100
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:14,154
Instead, draw a sum of 600,000.

1101
01:45:14,228 --> 01:45:15,957
Mr Sinha won't question you for it.

1102
01:45:16,163 --> 01:45:18,063
I can't do this.

1103
01:45:18,199 --> 01:45:21,862
It's not my money to play with.
I can't deceive Mr Sinha.

1104
01:45:22,003 --> 01:45:27,236
You are deceiving him. Aren't you
pretending to be his son-in-law?

1105
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:29,843
Nothing wrong in adding
one more deceit to the list.

1106
01:45:29,911 --> 01:45:31,936
I told him to put up this act.

1107
01:45:32,146 --> 01:45:36,014
He is putting up this act
to save daddy's life.

1108
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:39,017
Amrit, give him 500,000 tomorrow.

1109
01:45:39,153 --> 01:45:42,020
See that? She is quite smart.
Smarter than you.

1110
01:45:42,156 --> 01:45:45,148
She's also practical. She doesn't
aggravate matters unlike you.

1111
01:45:45,293 --> 01:45:48,023
Once I receive the money,
I'll testify in the court that...

1112
01:45:48,162 --> 01:45:49,561
you are not guilty.

1113
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:55,034
And after that you are not to be seen
in this area. Understand?

1114
01:45:55,169 --> 01:46:00,004
I haven't come here for recreation.
I came here to make money.

1115
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:03,042
I'll vanish once I receive the money.

1116
01:46:03,177 --> 01:46:05,839
Say what, partner?
Make the arrangements.

1117
01:46:15,456 --> 01:46:17,890
Rashmi, I can't cheat Mr Sinha.

1118
01:46:18,025 --> 01:46:20,289
You aren't cheating, I am.

1119
01:46:20,428 --> 01:46:23,363
But this isn't cheating.
The money belongs to me too.

1120
01:46:23,497 --> 01:46:25,795
And what difference
does 500,000 make?

1121
01:46:25,933 --> 01:46:29,528
Does the ocean go dry
if you remove a few drops?

1122
01:46:30,204 --> 01:46:31,398
Silly!

1123
01:46:35,076 --> 01:46:37,135
Where did the accident happen?
Where is Vijay?

1124
01:46:37,211 --> 01:46:38,200
Over there.

1125
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:48,716
Shut up and sit tight.

1126
01:46:51,192 --> 01:46:52,181
Help!

1127
01:46:55,629 --> 01:46:56,618
Hold it!

1128
01:46:59,433 --> 01:47:02,891
Put on this wedding dress.
And come out.

1129
01:48:21,215 --> 01:48:24,184
Get her. Else, we are doomed.

1130
01:48:25,186 --> 01:48:27,177
Where did this fellows come from?

1131
01:48:37,998 --> 01:48:40,796
Don't hit me. Please!
- Who sent you? - I'll tell you.

1132
01:48:41,068 --> 01:48:46,199
After the wedding,
disappear with Rashmi for some days.

1133
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:50,902
I'll give Sinha the good news that
Rashmi willingly married my son.

1134
01:48:51,045 --> 01:48:57,211
And in lieu of the good news
I'll take 1,000,000 from him.

1135
01:48:57,418 --> 01:49:00,819
Really? We'll see that later.

1136
01:49:00,955 --> 01:49:04,288
As for now, get ready
for a 1,000,000 lashings.

1137
01:49:04,425 --> 01:49:06,017
Hard ones for that.

1138
01:49:06,393 --> 01:49:09,260
Where did this fellow come from?
- Makhanlal...

1139
01:49:09,396 --> 01:49:11,887
I'll skin you alive!
- Let go of my father.

1140
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,429
Get them.

1141
01:49:20,508 --> 01:49:25,172
Bamboos! Praise the Lord!

1142
01:49:46,967 --> 01:49:48,594
Swine! Let go of me.

1143
01:49:53,007 --> 01:49:56,067
Scissors! Do you take me for a cloth?
Will you cut me to size?

1144
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:58,201
Help me, Vijay!

1145
01:49:58,345 --> 01:50:00,210
Quick!

1146
01:50:00,347 --> 01:50:02,941
Blacky! What says your fate?

1147
01:50:10,891 --> 01:50:13,223
I'll send you to the bamboo gardens!

1148
01:50:13,894 --> 01:50:14,883
Go!

1149
01:51:49,690 --> 01:51:50,679
Up!

1150
01:51:56,297 --> 01:51:57,696
Uncle, forgive us!

1151
01:51:58,532 --> 01:52:01,990
Forgive me, sir! I erred!
- Shut up!

1152
01:52:02,136 --> 01:52:04,366
You lived off us
for forty years, didn't you?

1153
01:52:04,505 --> 01:52:06,132
Is this the proof
of your loyalty?

1154
01:52:06,206 --> 01:52:09,073
Daddy, he forcibly tried
to get me married to Prem.

1155
01:52:09,209 --> 01:52:12,076
Inspector, take these ingrates away.

1156
01:52:12,212 --> 01:52:15,010
Forgive us!
- Shut up!

1157
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:18,414
I don't have anything
to give you but hatred.

1158
01:52:18,552 --> 01:52:22,420
Get out of my sight!
- Forgive us. Else, we'll be orphaned.

1159
01:52:24,224 --> 01:52:26,089
How did Prem know that
the bag carries money?

1160
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:30,153
Today is pay day. He knew
you would draw money from the bank.

1161
01:52:30,497 --> 01:52:31,555
Collect it.

1162
01:52:38,247 --> 01:52:40,215
I have examined the patient.

1163
01:52:43,853 --> 01:52:48,381
If she undergoes the same
circumstances once again...

1164
01:52:48,524 --> 01:52:51,652
it is possible that the shock she
may receive from the experiment...

1165
01:52:51,794 --> 01:52:53,557
might bring back her memory.

1166
01:52:53,696 --> 01:52:57,996
True. But the shock
may have side effects too.

1167
01:52:58,134 --> 01:53:00,796
She might become totally insane.
Anything can happen.

1168
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:04,235
No! Ali, forget it.

1169
01:53:04,407 --> 01:53:06,739
Uncle, I disagree with Dr Joshi.

1170
01:53:08,611 --> 01:53:12,945
There is a chance that
Juhi might not profit from it.

1171
01:53:13,082 --> 01:53:17,416
There is no question of side effects
since she will be in a semi trance.

1172
01:53:19,422 --> 01:53:22,289
These kind of experiments
are common in America.

1173
01:53:22,425 --> 01:53:24,825
And the success rate is about 80%

1174
01:53:25,661 --> 01:53:29,688
If Mr Vijay permits me,
I would love to experiment on her.

1175
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:34,863
As you think right.

1176
01:53:35,104 --> 01:53:37,538
Then, we shouldn't delay it.
I can begin right away.

1177
01:53:37,673 --> 01:53:38,662
All right.

1178
01:53:46,182 --> 01:53:48,582
Amrit, stop him.

1179
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:51,651
Just think. What will happen of you
if Juhi recovers?

1180
01:53:52,655 --> 01:53:54,384
I don't care!

1181
01:55:05,628 --> 01:55:06,686
No!

1182
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,394
Sister!

1183
01:55:21,277 --> 01:55:24,075
Don't worry.
Our experiment is successful.

1184
01:55:24,213 --> 01:55:26,408
She isn't unconscious.
Just a slumber.

1185
01:55:26,549 --> 01:55:28,744
She'll be perfectly all right
when she wakes up.

1186
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:31,278
I want to be alone with her
till she recovers.

1187
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,411
Please! Leave us alone.

1188
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:46,290
Sister.

1189
01:55:46,435 --> 01:55:50,371
Try to remember.
I'm Rashmi, your sister.

1190
01:55:50,806 --> 01:55:53,036
See... this is our house.

1191
01:55:53,642 --> 01:55:59,376
Daddy is waiting outside.
With you son Munna.

1192
01:56:04,587 --> 01:56:09,923
You will meet a stranger too.
Daddy takes him to be Vijay.

1193
01:56:10,593 --> 01:56:12,686
Actually, he's a very good man.

1194
01:56:14,396 --> 01:56:18,389
Hadn't he come to leave Munna here...

1195
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:21,468
anything could've happened to daddy...

1196
01:56:21,604 --> 01:56:27,406
on hearing the news
of the death of his son-in-law.

1197
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,877
He also stopped the illegal
activities going on in the factory.

1198
01:56:36,552 --> 01:56:40,545
I am in love with him.

1199
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:43,681
The scoundrel who had come
to leave you is also here.

1200
01:56:48,764 --> 01:56:51,358
Try to remember this tune.

1201
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,365
We've been humming this tune
since childhood.

1202
01:56:53,502 --> 01:56:54,867
Try to remember this song.

1203
02:01:03,752 --> 02:01:04,741
Aunt.

1204
02:01:09,758 --> 02:01:10,747
Brother Jaggu.

1205
02:01:21,103 --> 02:01:24,698
Thank god! I got back you
and my child.

1206
02:01:28,377 --> 02:01:31,369
Here's 10,000.
- What's the job?

1207
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:35,181
Shambu, You have an old score
to settle with Vijay. Finish him.

1208
02:01:35,317 --> 02:01:38,480
This is enough for me
to wipe out his whole family.

1209
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:42,317
Rest assured. The job will be done
tomorrow morning. See you later.

1210
02:01:54,536 --> 02:01:55,525
Strange!

1211
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:10,516
Hold it. More of it and he'll die.
It will become a police case.

1212
02:02:10,652 --> 02:02:13,212
We will be better off
if we throw him in the river.

1213
02:02:13,355 --> 02:02:15,482
He'll drown to his death.
And no one will suspect us.

1214
02:02:15,624 --> 02:02:16,613
Take him.

1215
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,349
Come along.

1216
02:02:23,365 --> 02:02:25,026
Mr Sinha, this is your
son-in-law. Vijay.

1217
02:02:27,035 --> 02:02:29,162
He died in the train accident.

1218
02:02:30,105 --> 02:02:34,371
And the one who is pretending
to be Vijay is Amrit.

1219
02:02:34,509 --> 02:02:36,500
A murderer who is at large.

1220
02:02:39,514 --> 02:02:42,142
But Juhi had...
- He blackmailed Juhi.

1221
02:02:42,284 --> 02:02:44,775
He threatened to kill Munna...

1222
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:47,582
if she didn't pretend
to take him as her husband.

1223
02:02:47,656 --> 02:02:49,647
What else could she have done?

1224
02:02:49,892 --> 02:02:54,454
Mr Sinha, if affection
is the greatest strength of a woman...

1225
02:02:54,596 --> 02:02:56,587
it's also the worst weakness of her.

1226
02:03:03,205 --> 02:03:05,036
I'll call the police.

1227
02:03:05,207 --> 02:03:07,198
Don't be foolish.

1228
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:11,511
I considered it.

1229
02:03:12,514 --> 02:03:16,177
Then it struck me that
it would bring you shame.

1230
02:03:16,318 --> 02:03:22,120
Till now, to the world,
you have presented Amrit as Vijay...

1231
02:03:22,324 --> 02:03:26,283
Juhi's husband. I care for Juhi,
she is my patient.

1232
02:03:26,428 --> 02:03:31,388
When I found out the truth,
I caught hold of him.

1233
02:03:31,533 --> 02:03:35,230
And pressurized him.
I told him that...

1234
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:39,431
if he quietly went away
I won't turn him in.

1235
02:03:39,574 --> 02:03:42,065
Mr Sinha, everyone is scared
to go to the gallows.

1236
02:03:42,210 --> 02:03:45,373
My words got into him.
And he went away for good.

1237
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:51,378
I'm obliged to you.
- No obligations, Mr Sinha.

1238
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:54,245
I did it on humanitarian grounds.

1239
02:03:59,594 --> 02:04:00,583
Yes daddy?

1240
02:04:02,731 --> 02:04:07,464
The one who stays with us...
Vijay, is he your husband?

1241
02:04:10,272 --> 02:04:12,570
And you? You too lied to me?

1242
02:04:14,476 --> 02:04:18,606
I prayed to see you grow up,
perhaps, to see this day!

1243
02:04:20,015 --> 02:04:22,210
I was a father to you...
I taught you to walk!

1244
02:04:22,417 --> 02:04:24,476
I played a mother to you...
to sing lullabies for you!

1245
02:04:24,553 --> 02:04:26,885
I played with you...
to substitute for a brother!

1246
02:04:27,022 --> 02:04:30,822
Today, I feel ashamed to look at you.

1247
02:04:31,293 --> 02:04:35,229
Don't call me daddy.
I don't want to be a father...

1248
02:04:35,364 --> 02:04:38,800
whose daughter pulls wool over his
eyes in the name of her husband.

1249
02:04:38,967 --> 02:04:40,730
I have a right to say too.

1250
02:04:40,869 --> 02:04:45,135
I disown a relationship with a father
who doubts his daughters' integrity.

1251
02:04:45,273 --> 02:04:46,570
Sister!
- Shut up!

1252
02:04:47,576 --> 02:04:50,511
Does that evil doctor hold more
importance for you than us?

1253
02:04:50,645 --> 02:04:52,636
You agreed to what he said?

1254
02:04:52,781 --> 02:04:55,215
Without any confirmation,
you decided to doubt our integrity.

1255
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:58,513
What remains to be confirmed?
If Vijay is husband...

1256
02:04:58,653 --> 02:05:00,177
then, who is this?

1257
02:05:11,233 --> 02:05:14,134
Aren't you playing games
along with him?

1258
02:05:14,269 --> 02:05:17,466
Watching this would your
husband's soul rest in peace...

1259
02:05:17,606 --> 02:05:20,404
in whose love you abandoned
your own house?

1260
02:05:21,676 --> 02:05:26,704
Yes. His soul will surely
rest in peace.

1261
02:05:28,283 --> 02:05:31,878
Because he trusted me.
And might still be trusting me.

1262
02:05:33,488 --> 02:05:35,752
I'll put an end to this game today
in front of you.

1263
02:05:39,428 --> 02:05:42,363
This bangles don't
give me satisfaction!

1264
02:05:43,932 --> 02:05:45,524
This mark of a married woman...

1265
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:48,431
on my forehead is like a fire
burning within me.

1266
02:05:49,871 --> 02:05:51,862
You have no right to insult my love!

1267
02:05:53,642 --> 02:05:57,476
You need not remind me
that I am a widow!

1268
02:05:59,114 --> 02:06:00,775
I know. I am a widow.

1269
02:06:01,683 --> 02:06:04,584
I had no choice but to burn
in this hell of disguised wifehood!

1270
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:08,314
For your sake.
For the sake of this house.

1271
02:06:08,457 --> 02:06:10,391
For the sake of my sister's love.

1272
02:06:14,529 --> 02:06:17,396
I had no selfish motives, daddy!

1273
02:06:21,803 --> 02:06:25,261
No proud father can tolerate
his daughter...

1274
02:06:25,407 --> 02:06:29,173
pretending to be a wife
of a fraud and a killer!

1275
02:06:29,711 --> 02:06:31,440
He is not a fraud.
Nor a killer!

1276
02:06:31,613 --> 02:06:34,377
Oh! So, he isn't a fraud anymore?

1277
02:06:34,483 --> 02:06:36,542
Didn't he come here
pretending to be Vijay?

1278
02:06:36,618 --> 02:06:39,519
Didn't he insult the love
and kindnesses we shoved on him?

1279
02:06:39,688 --> 02:06:43,488
No! He never came here as Vijay.
But you took him for Vijay.

1280
02:06:43,658 --> 02:06:45,523
"How can I call you daddy?"

1281
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:49,357
"I am just a stranger.
I am not even related to you."

1282
02:06:49,831 --> 02:06:52,493
I saw through Amrit
on the first day itself.

1283
02:06:52,634 --> 02:06:54,499
I even wanted to force him out.

1284
02:06:54,636 --> 02:06:59,369
But I saw that, at this age you
were leaning more on his shoulders.

1285
02:06:59,508 --> 02:07:04,036
For us your life is more precious!
So I backed out.

1286
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:10,481
But Amrit's conscience felt guilty.
He wasn't able to put on the act.

1287
02:07:10,619 --> 02:07:13,520
Stressed out, he wrote a letter
in which everything is clear.

1288
02:07:13,655 --> 02:07:15,384
And planned to go away.

1289
02:07:15,891 --> 02:07:17,381
Here's the letter.

1290
02:07:20,662 --> 02:07:25,065
Rashmi informed me that
he saved Munna's life...

1291
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,191
and that your business revived
because of him.

1292
02:07:27,802 --> 02:07:30,270
And now you try to name him a fraud?

1293
02:07:32,407 --> 02:07:34,602
I never expected this from you!

1294
02:07:35,544 --> 02:07:38,206
The quack Dr Joshi
is the actual fraud.

1295
02:07:38,346 --> 02:07:41,838
I had to put on this act
to save our family from him.

1296
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:44,614
But why did Amrit run away from here?

1297
02:07:44,753 --> 02:07:45,845
Ran away?

1298
02:07:47,489 --> 02:07:49,821
I am sure the quack
must be behind this.

1299
02:07:49,958 --> 02:07:51,755
He can hand him
over to the police.

1300
02:07:51,826 --> 02:07:55,227
Despite being innocent
he can be punished for murder.

1301
02:07:55,363 --> 02:07:57,991
Daddy, Amrit could be saved...

1302
02:07:58,133 --> 02:08:00,693
if the quack testifies that
the gun fired accidentally.

1303
02:08:01,236 --> 02:08:04,228
But why would he testify?
- For money!

1304
02:08:04,372 --> 02:08:09,241
He is a dog. Show him money
and he'll wag his tail.

1305
02:08:09,377 --> 02:08:11,242
How much will he demand?
100,000? Or 1,000,000?

1306
02:08:11,379 --> 02:08:12,710
Give it to him.

1307
02:08:13,215 --> 02:08:17,675
Sure. I'll even give my life for
the sake of my daughters' happiness.

1308
02:08:18,653 --> 02:08:20,587
Forgive me. Please!

1309
02:08:23,458 --> 02:08:26,393
Come fast. Look, uncle is pulling
someone out of the water.

1310
02:08:34,402 --> 02:08:35,869
Careful!

1311
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:40,638
Mr Sinha? You?
- Yes.

1312
02:08:43,345 --> 02:08:50,842
What should I call you? Dr Joshi?
Or Bhagwat Singh the blackmailer?

1313
02:08:52,554 --> 02:08:54,647
I think you should call me an angel.

1314
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:02,424
If I had desired,
I could've left her to her fate.

1315
02:09:02,564 --> 02:09:07,228
I could've even hidden her.
And extorted money out of you.

1316
02:09:07,369 --> 02:09:12,136
It's clear, for you the money isn't
more precious than your daughter.

1317
02:09:12,574 --> 02:09:14,769
This bag contains 600,000.

1318
02:09:17,178 --> 02:09:18,543
You may count it.

1319
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:22,377
If you insist I'll take it.
But I won't count it.

1320
02:09:23,385 --> 02:09:25,751
You won't lie for this
trivial amount, would you?

1321
02:09:25,887 --> 02:09:29,516
I trust you.
- But I don't trust you.

1322
02:09:29,691 --> 02:09:33,787
The money will be yours. But only
after testifying in the court.

1323
02:09:34,596 --> 02:09:38,862
It's possible that you may lose your
memory once you receive the money.

1324
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,833
The only thing you might recollect
is that Amrit killed the girl.

1325
02:09:42,604 --> 02:09:46,335
Prove him not guilty.
And take the money.

1326
02:09:46,474 --> 02:09:50,342
What if you retract
after the testimony?

1327
02:09:50,545 --> 02:09:54,743
I am not a blackmailer.
I never fail to keep my word.

1328
02:09:54,883 --> 02:09:57,010
But...

1329
02:09:57,218 --> 02:10:00,119
if the money remains with me
as a token of surety...

1330
02:10:00,255 --> 02:10:02,883
it would be easier for me
to say the truth.

1331
02:10:03,024 --> 02:10:06,118
Actually, I am so habituated
to lie that...

1332
02:10:06,261 --> 02:10:09,424
my tongue slips
when I try to say the truth.

1333
02:10:09,564 --> 02:10:11,623
Keep the bag down.

1334
02:10:13,101 --> 02:10:14,261
Move it.

1335
02:10:15,637 --> 02:10:19,368
And remember...
I know to use the gun.

1336
02:10:40,528 --> 02:10:42,325
Luska? You?

1337
02:10:42,931 --> 02:10:44,421
Let me explain.

1338
02:10:45,533 --> 02:10:51,130
Kajal was hit. But the wound
wasn't serious. And she survived.

1339
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:54,934
The police came for her statement
when she regained consciousness.

1340
02:10:55,076 --> 02:10:59,479
That swine Bhagwat Singh wanted Kajal
to testify against you.

1341
02:10:59,614 --> 02:11:01,946
But I made her see reasons.

1342
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:05,052
I told her that earlier she had
instigated Bhagwat Singh...

1343
02:11:05,186 --> 02:11:10,488
to falsely implicate you in the theft
case which got you in for two years.

1344
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:14,026
I told her not to do such
an injustice to you again.

1345
02:11:14,162 --> 02:11:19,429
She understood. And stated that
nobody fired at her.

1346
02:11:19,567 --> 02:11:22,695
The gun went off
when she was trying to clean it.

1347
02:11:24,472 --> 02:11:27,373
That means I was unnecessarily
wandering owning up a crime...

1348
02:11:27,442 --> 02:11:28,875
and evading the police?

1349
02:11:29,377 --> 02:11:35,043
Amrit, I'll tell the police that
B.K. Had robbed the necklace.

1350
02:11:35,517 --> 02:11:37,883
Even if I have to go
to jail for that.

1351
02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:42,986
Munna has been kidnapped!
- What happens now?

1352
02:11:43,158 --> 02:11:44,523
Nothing, Miss Sinha.

1353
02:11:45,326 --> 02:11:49,319
Mr Sinha, it won't help you
if you panic like a child.

1354
02:11:49,464 --> 02:11:51,329
Munna is with me.
And he is very comfortable.

1355
02:11:54,269 --> 02:11:56,203
Please don't call me a bastard.

1356
02:11:56,337 --> 02:12:01,001
Try some other subtle words.

1357
02:12:01,209 --> 02:12:05,509
Let's play a game
of cuss words. You first.

1358
02:12:05,647 --> 02:12:10,141
If anything happens to Munna,
I'll kill you!

1359
02:12:11,519 --> 02:12:14,352
Why do you scream? I am not deaf.

1360
02:12:16,591 --> 02:12:21,426
And why will anything happen to him?
He is in comfort out there.

1361
02:12:21,563 --> 02:12:24,361
He's sucking lollipop.
And eating chocolates.

1362
02:12:25,366 --> 02:12:27,698
You think you are too smart?

1363
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:37,373
The other day at gunpoint you
snatched 600,000 from me, didn't you?

1364
02:12:37,512 --> 02:12:40,037
Never try to remove food
from an elephant's mouth.

1365
02:12:41,249 --> 02:12:46,915
That day I remained silent.
And you thought I am out, didn't you?

1366
02:12:48,723 --> 02:12:50,714
I won't point a gun at you.

1367
02:12:52,694 --> 02:12:54,719
I hate the sound of firearms.

1368
02:12:56,064 --> 02:13:00,330
Imagine that your grandson
is standing just in front of you.

1369
02:13:00,468 --> 02:13:02,698
Give me 600,000 and take him.

1370
02:13:02,837 --> 02:13:05,067
I'll hand you over to the police.

1371
02:13:05,406 --> 02:13:07,670
Should I dial the number for you?

1372
02:13:07,809 --> 02:13:12,473
Lock-ups are no longer uncomfortable.

1373
02:13:12,614 --> 02:13:15,014
I'll relax in there for sometime.

1374
02:13:15,149 --> 02:13:17,413
But just think of Munna.

1375
02:13:18,019 --> 02:13:22,683
As long as he has the lollipops
and chocolates with him he'll enjoy.

1376
02:13:23,691 --> 02:13:28,025
Then the lollipops will finish.
And the chocolates too.

1377
02:13:28,162 --> 02:13:31,495
Then it will dawn on him
that he is all alone.

1378
02:13:31,633 --> 02:13:34,625
Then the darkness of the night
will creep in.

1379
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:39,028
And he'll begin to cry out of fear.

1380
02:13:40,108 --> 02:13:42,372
There's no one to hear his voice.

1381
02:13:43,111 --> 02:13:46,376
Slowly the night
will assume darkness.

1382
02:13:47,081 --> 02:13:49,379
His cries will weaken!

1383
02:13:49,684 --> 02:13:51,049
Weaker!

1384
02:13:51,219 --> 02:13:52,379
Weaker!
- No!

1385
02:13:53,888 --> 02:13:56,823
Daddy, give him the money!
- No!

1386
02:13:56,958 --> 02:14:00,052
I won't give a blackmailer
a single penny!

1387
02:14:00,228 --> 02:14:02,719
Is your money more precious
to you than my child?

1388
02:14:03,665 --> 02:14:06,133
Stay here. I'll bring the money.

1389
02:14:07,068 --> 02:14:10,401
My Munna is more precious
to me than 600,000!

1390
02:14:17,278 --> 02:14:21,408
Miss Sinha, this delicate fair hands
are for hugging Amrit.

1391
02:14:21,549 --> 02:14:23,278
Don't use them for slapping.

1392
02:14:23,418 --> 02:14:29,015
If I use a little more pressure
it will crack like a piece of straw.

1393
02:14:29,157 --> 02:14:32,422
And then it will be in plasters.
For a few months.

1394
02:14:34,562 --> 02:14:39,499
Just remember that you are just
a delicate harmless woman!

1395
02:14:39,634 --> 02:14:44,628
Thank me that instead of breaking it,
I am leaving it.

1396
02:14:47,976 --> 02:14:48,965
Here.

1397
02:14:49,377 --> 02:14:52,244
Hold it. I am not a coward.

1398
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:55,247
I shall deal with a blackmailer.

1399
02:14:55,383 --> 02:14:57,544
My daughter won't go
with a blackmailer. I will.

1400
02:14:57,685 --> 02:14:58,674
Let's go.

1401
02:15:03,257 --> 02:15:07,250
Sister, we shouldn't leave daddy
alone with him.

1402
02:15:07,395 --> 02:15:09,022
Let's follow them. Come.

1403
02:15:16,404 --> 02:15:17,803
Bring the kid here.

1404
02:15:18,906 --> 02:15:20,396
Bhola, bring the kid.

1405
02:15:27,615 --> 02:15:28,604
Wait there.

1406
02:15:30,818 --> 02:15:32,080
The money first.

1407
02:15:36,224 --> 02:15:37,213
Give him.

1408
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:43,219
Hold it.

1409
02:15:44,365 --> 02:15:48,358
Did you see? I know how to remove
food from an elephant's mouth.

1410
02:15:48,503 --> 02:15:50,630
Toss the bag here.
- Patience...

1411
02:15:50,805 --> 02:15:51,794
Toss it!

1412
02:15:54,776 --> 02:15:55,902
There it is.

1413
02:16:06,621 --> 02:16:10,284
Don't worry doctor. I am here.

1414
02:16:21,402 --> 02:16:24,735
An elephant can surprise you
by its moves.

1415
02:16:25,707 --> 02:16:30,269
When it goes on a rampage,
it destroys the whole forest.

1416
02:16:37,351 --> 02:16:39,342
Throw him down the hill.

1417
02:16:39,554 --> 02:16:40,543
No!

1418
02:16:57,672 --> 02:16:59,196
No, I won't kill you.

1419
02:17:34,142 --> 02:17:36,610
Let go of me!
- Swine! Leave her alone.

1420
02:17:36,744 --> 02:17:37,733
Let go of me!

1421
02:17:39,547 --> 02:17:41,014
Give Munna to me.

1422
02:17:49,223 --> 02:17:50,349
Scoundrel!
Take this.

1423
02:18:29,597 --> 02:18:30,586
Leave me!

1424
02:18:56,624 --> 02:18:57,613
Leave him!

1425
02:18:58,559 --> 02:18:59,685
Leave him alone.

1426
02:20:38,059 --> 02:20:39,526
No! Please!

1427
02:21:10,758 --> 02:21:13,352
I am impressed!

1428
02:21:14,562 --> 02:21:18,362
You won't relent.
Perhaps this will do the job.

1429
02:21:27,608 --> 02:21:30,634
Oh, mistakes!
I shouldn't cut the rope.

1430
02:21:31,479 --> 02:21:33,709
I should cut your hands.

1431
02:22:41,248 --> 02:22:42,510
What does this mean?

1432
02:22:43,384 --> 02:22:46,046
I have fulfilled my duty.
Now I take your leave.

1433
02:22:46,253 --> 02:22:50,383
You have fulfilled your duty.
But I have to fulfill mine.

1434
02:22:50,524 --> 02:22:52,515
I dislike fake articles.

1435
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:56,528
You came here as a fake son-in-law.
Now you stay here as a real one.

1436
02:22:56,664 --> 02:23:00,395
Right. Rashmi was compelled to
address you as brother-in-law.

1437
02:23:00,534 --> 02:23:03,401
Fake brother-in-law!
And a fake sister-in-law!

1438
02:23:03,571 --> 02:23:05,471
Now I'll address you
as brother-in-law.

1439
02:23:05,606 --> 02:23:07,540
A real brother-in-law.
And a sister-in-law.
