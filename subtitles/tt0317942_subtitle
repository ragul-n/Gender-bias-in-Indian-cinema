00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,683
It is like seeing new
splendour all over,

178
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,944
These waterfalls with wetness,

179
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,917
Made a festival of green all over,

180
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,093
Not knowing it a dream
or imagination,

181
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,696
My heart started dreaming,

182
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,440
The fragrance of the flowers,

183
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,947
Makes me blush with shame,

184
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:35,110
Why is this is heart of mine
singing with joy today?

185
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,622
Tell me, Peacock do you
feel the melodies,

186
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,657
It is like seeing new
splendor all over,

187
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,667
This body has forgetting itself,

188
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,728
This mind is souring with delight.

189
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,969
Why this enthusiasm in me.

190
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,609
Tell me, Peacock do you

191
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:40,709
Desires like souring in the sky,

192
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,628
Feeling like swimming like
a fish in the river,

193
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:02,664
The sky is new, the earth is new,

194
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:08,676
Why does it feel like that
to my heart, today?

195
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,616
Tell me, Peacock do you
feel the melodies,

There is like new sprouts all over.

201
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,834
This body has forgetting itself,

202
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,177
This mind is souring with delight,

203
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,180

00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,874

For this beautiful face,
curd is the reason

264
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,771
No, teacher no!

265
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,573
Curd is the reason

266
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,739

267
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,576

Super!

271
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,600
For this beautiful face,
curd is the reason

272
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,804
Yeh!

273
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,071

My close friend Manoj.

275
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,634
Suma is a very good girl,
but a little shy.

276
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,770
She sings very well.

277
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,577
I am her music teacher. But? How
did you know that she sings?

278
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,117
It shows on her face
that she is a singer.

279
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,549
What? On the face its..?

280
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,849
Praveen, where is Shanta Grandpa?

281
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,584
Shanta Grandpa? Can you
hear that music sound?

282
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,717
But..?

283
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,852
Teacher you keep quiet.

284
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,555
The drum beats?
- Yes I can hear.

285
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,592
In the fields he has made
his own Fine Art classes.

Okay, by the time tea will be
ready. No, he is a little..

290
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,775
bit inane. I will introduce
you when he is in mood.

291
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,811
It's all right if he is not in mood.

292
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,610
But? How do you know

293

How many times to tell

296
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,828

I have done all arrangements.
We are going to Yana.

330
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,372
Beautiful place. Like
the place there is

331
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,570
Iot of legends to it. Heard
the story of Basmasur?

332
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,702
Yes.

333
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,373
Some say the rock is
related to the ash

334
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,541
of his death. Some eminent
scientists..

335
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,815
..argue that this rock is formed
from volcanic eruption.

336
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,583
Any way you have to see this place.

337
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,121
Yes, tomorrow's programme
will be that.

338
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,754
It is not that easy.

339
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,886
till the place we have to
walk for four kilometers.

340
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,891
Brother, are you going to Yana?
 Then even I am coming.

341
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,399
Sudha, we do not get anything to
eat there, pack some foodstuffs..

342
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,560
..and ask to Maruthi to come,

347
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,879

We will see to that that she comes.

351
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,840
You take care of Shantha Grandpa

537
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,997
This has become your daily fight.

538
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,569
Bhatt, you say, What
he did was right?

539
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,400
This has become a daily appeal.
Is this a village

540
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,133

become a daily grief.

541
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,542
Hey! Jaji what is

542
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,807

01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:52,939
He is my friend. Let

544
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,810

Hey! First tell us what happened?

555
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,507
Sudha, You see this.

556
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:30,579
My father thrashed me very badly.
He is the cause.

557
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,712
What has he done?

558
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,551
He carried tales to my father.

559
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,114
Then then why did you
go out with Madhav?

560
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,854
Who are you to ask that? It
is my wish. He is my friend.

561
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,791
And I will go out with anyone

562
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,628
I like I am not your wife,
to listen to you.

563
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,668
That will not do. You will
have to listen to me.

564
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,798
You are going to marry me in future.

565
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,564
Let's see. You forget
of marrying me,

566
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,732
first look at yourself
in the mirror.

567
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,867
I will see how that fellow
will marry you.

568
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,570
If you have the guts, try
to stop my marriage.

569
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,138
Hey! Maruthi, do not bother
her again.  Take care.

570
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,777
But, Bhatt, I am going to
marry her in the future.

571
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,582
Her father has promised me.

572
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,145
Yes, he will, he will promise.
Does he think he is my owner?

573
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,785
Keep quiet. Sudha, apply some
ointment on her back,

574
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:18,732
So, this is the story. Who is
this Mahadev? Do you love him?

575
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,762
Yes.

576
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,430
How nicely she is saying
yes. No, Manoj sir,

577
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,768
that is all lies.  That
fellow is a big rogue.

578
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,898
He has made her mad with love.

579
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,739
You keep quiet. She knows
what is right and wrong.

580
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,903

01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:00,828
Yes.

871
01:39:00,904 --> 01:39:01,962
It is all his blessings.

872
01:39:02,039 --> 01:39:03,097
Teacher, take have some more.

873
01:39:03,173 --> 01:39:06,506
No child. Listen Suma,

so I will teach a
song you sing that.

877
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:16,910
Teacher you come with me.

878
01:39:16,987 --> 01:39:21,651
Sure, I want to see you
sing in the studio.

879
01:39:27,731 --> 01:39:33,192
'Spoilt it, spoilt it,
you spoilt everything.

880
01:39:39,009 --> 01:39:45,744
You shattered his dreams,

881
01:39:45,816 --> 01:39:50,651
his desires everything.'

882
01:39:54,725 --> 01:39:56,989
'You are cause to this,
you are responsible

883
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:01,019
to this, bloody you
are responsible'.

884
01:40:01,965 --> 01:40:05,696
'Go, go, you don't have
any rights. Have you?

885
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:09,204
Have you? Have you got any
rights to ruin their life'?

886
01:40:10,073 --> 01:40:17,104
'Sin! Man, sin! You get away from
their lives, far away from them'.

887
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:23,716
'Everything is spoilt. Suma had
hoped to be a famous artist.'

888
01:40:32,529 --> 01:40:40,459
'Praveen, praveen, praveen
is your friend, and he

889
01:40:40,537 --> 01:40:49,002
might go mad, go mad..

890
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:53,015
Will you be happy then?

891
01:40:54,084 --> 01:40:57,679
'Good, very good, very good.

892
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:12,499
No, no, You have to be

893
01:41:12,569 --> 01:41:15,629
here, help Suma become
a successful singer..

894
01:41:15,705 --> 01:41:20,699
..unite them, only then
you can go on your way,

895
01:41:20,777 --> 01:41:23,940
understand? Do understand'.

896
01:41:53,577 --> 01:41:59,743
Manoj! Suma.

897
01:42:09,993 --> 01:42:17,923
'Manoj, Suma, Suma Manoj, yes that
is right. I have to do that.'

898
01:42:24,007 --> 01:42:27,636
Viewers, there is a special
programme for you all.

899
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:29,440
Now you will hear a song from..

900
01:42:29,512 --> 01:42:35,610
..famous movie playback
singer Mrs. no

901
01:42:35,685 --> 01:42:36,947
Miss. Suma. Miss Suma.

902
01:42:38,588 --> 01:42:39,782
Once more.

903
01:42:39,856 --> 01:42:40,948
Yes, Viewers..

904
01:42:41,024 --> 01:42:42,719
Stop! Do not boast too much.

905
01:42:42,792 --> 01:42:45,625
You just wait and watch. One
day you all will watch

906
01:42:45,695 --> 01:42:48,664
me sing, sitting in front
of the t.v. just like this.

907
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:49,790
Oh!

908
01:42:49,866 --> 01:42:50,958
Call them for dinner.

909
01:43:10,553 --> 01:43:13,215
Brother, come for dinner.

910
01:43:14,824 --> 01:43:15,882
Call Manoj.

911
01:43:20,597 --> 01:43:21,757
Okay, Manoj come for dinner.

912
01:43:22,832 --> 01:43:25,630
Sudha call Praveen,
we will eat together.

913
01:43:28,705 --> 01:43:29,763
Animals are like humans; they too

914
01:43:29,839 --> 01:43:30,965
have feelings like
love and affection.

915
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,633
If we show them a little
love and care

916
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:34,939
they too start caring for us.

917
01:43:35,111 --> 01:43:36,442
Any animal or human come closer to

918
01:43:36,513 --> 01:43:39,949
us only when they have
full faith in us.

919
01:43:41,551 --> 01:43:43,610
A little bit of difference
in our behaviour

920
01:43:43,687 --> 01:43:45,450
they feel hurt and they
drift away from us..

921
01:43:45,522 --> 01:43:47,649
..when they realize
they do not get any

922
01:43:47,724 --> 01:43:48,850
Iove from us. It is
a simple psychology.

923
01:44:32,669 --> 01:44:33,897
Look one more elephant!

924
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:35,028
Shut up.

925
01:44:54,791 --> 01:44:56,520
'A little bit of difference
in our behaviour

926
01:44:56,593 --> 01:44:58,686
they feel hurt and they
drift away from us..

927
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:00,787
..when they realize
they do not get any

928
01:45:00,864 --> 01:45:03,264
Iove from us. It is
a simple psychology'.

929
01:45:11,207 --> 01:45:14,540
Mr. Manoj, I have prepared a song

930
01:45:14,611 --> 01:45:16,670
to sing in front of your
father. Come inside.

931
01:45:16,746 --> 01:45:17,804
No, some other time.

932
01:45:17,881 --> 01:45:18,939
Please come.

933
01:45:19,849 --> 01:45:21,646
Come Manoj, you listen
while having tea.

934
01:45:21,718 --> 01:45:22,980
Sister, put me down.

935
01:45:23,053 --> 01:45:28,753
Wait. Baby elephant!

936
01:45:28,825 --> 01:45:29,883
Baby camel.

937
01:45:29,959 --> 01:45:31,654
Donkey, are you calling
me baby camel

938
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:33,821
Leave me.

939
01:45:34,664 --> 01:45:35,824
Leave him and go.

940
01:45:40,904 --> 01:45:44,965
Come let us go up. Deepu
come play the tabla.

941
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:46,668
No I will not play the tabla.
 - Why?

942
01:45:46,743 --> 01:45:47,835
That uncle is not good.

943
01:45:48,912 --> 01:45:49,970
I will hit you.

944
01:45:51,648 --> 01:45:53,775
Manoj, you go listen to
the song, I will be back.

945
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:53,809
They feel hurt and they drift
away from us..

946
01:46:53,877 --> 01:46:55,811
..if they don't get love from us.
It is a simple psychology.

947
01:46:59,816 --> 01:47:01,784
Stop it. Do not sing wrong words.

948
01:47:02,585 --> 01:47:03,916
I you have to sing, first
learn to sing properly.

949
01:47:05,688 --> 01:47:06,848
But it was right.

950
01:47:09,926 --> 01:47:11,257
What right?  Then sing once more.

951
01:47:30,647 --> 01:47:37,746
No it is wrong. First learn to sing.

952
01:48:00,843 --> 01:48:01,969
Manoj, what wrong?

953
01:48:02,045 --> 01:48:03,239
Nothing. I will hear next time.

954
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:04,840
Tell me what happened?

955
01:48:04,914 --> 01:48:05,972
Nothing.

956
01:48:08,818 --> 01:48:13,778
I told you that uncle is not
good. He made Suma cry.

957
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:19,619
Hey! Suma what happened?

958
01:50:33,696 --> 01:50:34,958
Teacher!  Teacher! Is this wrong?

959
01:50:36,866 --> 01:50:37,958
Come inside.

960
01:51:06,062 --> 01:51:08,656
Teacher! Is this song wrong?

961
01:51:08,731 --> 01:51:14,795
No, child, it is right, who
told you that it is wrong my

962
01:51:14,871 --> 01:51:20,707
child? What happened to you
my child? Come inside.

963
01:51:28,785 --> 01:51:32,949
Suma, forgive me, forgive
me, and forgive me.

964
01:52:37,019 --> 01:52:39,180
Oh! Love I will never
open my heart for you,

965
01:52:39,956 --> 01:52:42,652
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

966
01:52:43,025 --> 01:52:45,823
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

967
01:52:46,562 --> 01:52:49,190
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you,

968
01:52:49,966 --> 01:52:54,198
The heart Oh!  The heart Oh!

969
01:52:56,706 --> 01:52:58,606
Reminisces again and again,

970
01:52:58,674 --> 01:52:59,800
With the lovely moments we spent,

971
01:52:59,876 --> 01:53:02,674
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

972
01:53:02,745 --> 01:53:05,737
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

973
01:53:41,784 --> 01:53:44,753
Even if a fragrant flower
is in front of you,

974
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:47,914
Whose destiny it is in who knows?

975
01:53:54,997 --> 01:53:57,659
Oh! Cruel love because of you,

976
01:53:58,134 --> 01:53:59,999
There were battles,

977
01:54:01,637 --> 01:54:04,731
Thousands of life because of you,

978
01:54:04,807 --> 01:54:07,002
Died of separation and longings.

979
01:54:08,644 --> 01:54:11,636
This heart is aching
with pain of love

980
01:54:11,714 --> 01:54:14,683
Where did the flowers of love
disappear in the heart?

981
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,685
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

982
01:54:18,754 --> 01:54:20,949
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

983
01:54:22,024 --> 01:54:26,222
The heart Oh!  The heart Oh!

984
01:54:28,564 --> 01:54:29,826
Reminisces again and again,

985
01:54:29,899 --> 01:54:30,991
With the lovely moments we spent,

986
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:34,799
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

987
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:37,771
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

988
01:55:18,914 --> 01:55:21,712
Life has become only
illusion of dreams,

989
01:55:21,784 --> 01:55:24,753
Why this dream caught in a dream?

990
01:55:31,961 --> 01:55:34,862
This love is also
not true but dream,

991
01:55:35,665 --> 01:55:37,758
Why does it not come
out from its daze?

992
01:55:38,834 --> 01:55:41,769
This subdued life,
destroyed by love,

993
01:55:41,837 --> 01:55:43,998
Made to dance like a doll to love

994
01:55:45,574 --> 01:55:48,668
When there was love
flowing in my heart

995
01:55:48,744 --> 01:55:50,769
Why did I find the shadow of flower?

996
01:55:51,847 --> 01:55:54,816
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

997
01:55:55,685 --> 01:55:58,017
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

998
01:55:58,888 --> 01:56:03,723
The heart Oh!  The heart Oh!

999
01:56:05,194 --> 01:56:06,525
Reminisces again and again,

1000
01:56:06,595 --> 01:56:07,960
With the lovely moments we spent,

1001
01:56:09,031 --> 01:56:11,795
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

1002
01:56:11,867 --> 01:56:14,768
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

1003
01:56:15,571 --> 01:56:18,734
Oh! Love my heart will
never open for you,

1004
01:56:18,808 --> 01:56:21,743
Even if you cry, I will
never pity you.

1005
01:56:51,974 --> 01:56:54,670
Master, What happened? What is
it that's hurting you so much?

1006
01:56:54,744 --> 01:56:57,975
Why don't you speak it out? You
will feel relieved of pain.

1007
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,780
No, Jaji even if I tell
anyone my pain,

1008
01:57:03,853 --> 01:57:06,913
no one can help me.
Even you can't help.

1009
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:12,689
You try telling, master. I will
give my life to help you.

1010
01:58:17,126 --> 01:58:18,616
Yeh! What happened?
Why did you scream?

1011
01:58:19,695 --> 01:58:23,859
Nothing, she saw a rat
and started screaming.

1012
01:58:27,536 --> 01:58:30,664
Very nice. Behaving like the
house has fallen down.

1013
01:58:30,739 --> 01:58:34,732
Praveen did you have bath?
Go bathe and come.

1014
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:03,900
For how long will you
suffer like this?

1015
01:59:04,974 --> 01:59:08,705
Sudha, please leave me alone.

1016
01:59:09,778 --> 01:59:13,236
Why don't you tell Manoj the truth,
that you love Suma?

1017
01:59:13,682 --> 01:59:17,846
Manoj is a very sensitive
person he might

1018
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:20,650
go mad if he does not get Suma.

1019
01:59:21,957 --> 01:59:25,950
His life will be spoiled.
I cannot bear to see that.

1020
01:59:26,762 --> 01:59:29,925
Same way, I can't bear to see
my brother spoil his life.

1021
01:59:29,999 --> 01:59:31,057
Suma!

1022
01:59:32,835 --> 01:59:35,804
If you cannot tell Manoj.
I will tell him the truth.

1023
01:59:36,872 --> 01:59:41,673
Suma, you promised me that
you would not tell anyone.

1024
01:59:41,744 --> 01:59:44,736
I did not promise, you
took my promise.

1025
01:59:45,814 --> 01:59:52,481
I will sacrifice my
love and this will be

1026
01:59:52,554 --> 02:00:00,893
right thing to do. It has to
be like that.  That's all.

1027
02:00:15,778 --> 02:00:19,179
'Yeh! Will it suit me if
I comb my hair like this?

1028
02:00:19,615 --> 02:00:20,775
Nice.

1029
02:00:20,849 --> 02:00:21,907
What nice?

1030
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:23,778
Nice
- No.

1031
02:00:23,919 --> 02:00:27,650
Brother, like Manoj you too
shave off the mustache.

1032
02:00:27,723 --> 02:00:29,714
No, mustache suits you, if you shave

1033
02:00:31,794 --> 02:00:34,957
it I will not look at your face.'

1034
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:38,793
I want to shave off my mustache.

1035
02:00:38,867 --> 02:00:39,925
Mustache suits you, sir.

1036
02:00:40,636 --> 02:00:41,796
Do as you are told.

1037
02:01:00,889 --> 02:01:04,222
Mother look! A folk dancer has come.

1038
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:05,820
What is that?

1039
02:01:05,894 --> 02:01:06,952
Remove your hand from the face.

1040
02:01:07,029 --> 02:01:09,725
Oh! God, why did you shave
off the mustache?

1041
02:01:10,065 --> 02:01:11,157
He is participating
in the folk dance.

1042
02:01:11,667 --> 02:01:13,760
I am not participating,
just going to watch it.

1043
02:01:14,837 --> 02:01:16,668
Not watching he is participating.

1044
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:21,642
Watching? Mustache? What is this?

1045
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:22,836
Without taking bath,
you have shaved off?

1046
02:01:23,912 --> 02:01:24,970
Fine, now you go chance and come.

1047
02:01:46,068 --> 02:01:47,467
What are you doing? Don't
you want to bath,

1048
02:01:47,536 --> 02:01:48,867
eat food or water?

1049
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:54,472
They all are searching for you.
 To tell you the truth..

1050
02:01:54,543 --> 02:01:57,637
..you are not the same as you were
when you came. You are withdrawn..

1051
02:01:57,713 --> 02:01:59,977
..behave like the whole
world has fallen apart.

1052
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:03,484
What happened? Look Mister,
if I there

1053
02:02:03,552 --> 02:02:08,216
was anything less in my
hospitality, please forgive me.

1054
02:02:09,091 --> 02:02:10,649
What are talking? Am I a guest here?

1055
02:02:10,726 --> 02:02:11,818
I always thought this as my home.

1056
02:02:11,894 --> 02:02:15,227
Then? Why do you look so
depressed these days?

1057
02:02:16,899 --> 02:02:17,957
Look, do not worry.

1058
02:02:19,034 --> 02:02:21,594
Everything will be allright.
I will correct it.

1059
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:23,763
What will you correct?

1060
02:02:23,839 --> 02:02:24,931
Everything that has gone wrong.

1061
02:02:26,608 --> 02:02:28,166
And whatever that will
go wrong in the future.

1062
02:02:28,744 --> 02:02:30,837
How can you change the future now?

1063
02:02:32,614 --> 02:02:33,774
You wait and watch.

1064
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,943
Praveen, will you do me a favour?

1065
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:40,611
Hey! Why do you ask like that?
I can do anything, if

1066
02:02:40,689 --> 02:02:43,624
you want I will change the
direction of the earth.

1067
02:02:44,693 --> 02:02:47,457
All that is not needed. I
have to go to Gokaran for a

1068
02:02:47,529 --> 02:02:49,622
week. I have to prepare
data for the project.

1069
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:51,791
This is very important to me.

1070
02:02:51,867 --> 02:02:53,960
You take Suma to Bangalore
on  Thursday.

1071
02:02:54,703 --> 02:02:55,795
There stay back at my
place, and finish

1072
02:02:55,871 --> 02:02:56,963
off Suma's recording work.

1073
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:02,676
That is impossible.
You go with Suma.

1074
02:03:03,745 --> 02:03:05,975
Giving big talks but can't
do a small favour.

1075
02:03:07,049 --> 02:03:08,141
This is the matter of her career.

1076
02:03:08,851 --> 02:03:11,979
She will be famous artist in
future. Do not disappoint her.

1077
02:03:12,921 --> 02:03:14,479
This project is very
important to my..

1078
02:03:14,556 --> 02:03:16,421
..career and I cannot
avoid this. As a friend

1079
02:03:16,492 --> 02:03:17,891
can't you do this small
favour for her?

1080
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,791
Look, you have to go to Bangalore.

1081
02:03:20,863 --> 02:03:25,630
Sorry, I cannot do that. You
have inspired her to sing.

1082
02:03:26,702 --> 02:03:27,896
You promised to take
her to Bangalore.

1083
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:30,438
She hopes you will take
her. I do not know

1084
02:03:30,506 --> 02:03:33,634
anything about music and recording.

1085
02:03:35,711 --> 02:03:39,704
And the fact is that she
is definitely more

1086
02:03:39,781 --> 02:03:41,840
comfortable with you.
So you take her.

1087
02:03:42,918 --> 02:03:44,647
I have lot of work in court.

1088
02:03:45,721 --> 02:03:49,919
Your work is more important to you
than her happiness is it not?

1089
02:03:49,992 --> 02:03:51,960
Why? Is your work not
more important to you?

1090
02:03:53,028 --> 02:03:54,620
Finish off the recording
and get your work done.

1091
02:03:54,696 --> 02:04:01,192
Look, she understands you better.
With you, she is more enthusiastic.

1092
02:04:01,870 --> 02:04:02,928
You are misunderstanding!

1093
02:04:03,005 --> 02:04:04,063
There is nothing to misunderstand;.

1094
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,937
you are going to take
her to Bangalore

1095
02:04:06,542 --> 02:04:07,804
No.

1096
02:04:07,876 --> 02:04:08,968
Yes, and that is final.

1097
02:04:09,645 --> 02:04:11,670
It's only on  Thursday,
now go have bath.

1098
02:04:13,749 --> 02:04:15,979
He says it is my fault. I will
correct him.

1099
02:04:28,564 --> 02:04:32,022
Manoj! Manoj! Manoj.

1100
02:04:49,117 --> 02:04:52,712
Suma, I think Master did
not hear you call.

1101
02:04:53,789 --> 02:04:54,915
Yes.

1102
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:58,016
Suma, Manoj is a very good man.

1103
02:04:58,894 --> 02:04:59,986
Where were you going?

1104
02:05:00,062 --> 02:05:04,829
To the field, I met Manoj on the
way he told he will drop me.

1105
02:05:15,844 --> 02:05:16,970
Is it Sumi? Come.

1106
02:05:18,046 --> 02:05:23,211
Yeh! Hari will you play with
me? How are you Hari?

1107
02:05:23,652 --> 02:05:25,745
Sumi, what is the occasion,
you have worn a sari.

1108
02:05:25,821 --> 02:05:26,879
Nothing, just like that.

1109
02:05:26,955 --> 02:05:28,718
Hey! Praveen Suma is come.

1110
02:05:32,794 --> 02:05:33,920

You go meet her.

1114
02:05:43,138 --> 02:05:45,003
Suma will you go with them? Suma!

1115
02:05:50,712 --> 02:05:51,838
I will set the camera.

1116
02:05:51,913 --> 02:05:53,778
You can do that afterwards,
now you go meet Suma.

1117
02:06:29,818 --> 02:06:30,876
Is it okay?

1118
02:06:40,962 --> 02:06:45,661
Hey! Why did you remove
your mustache, did I not

1119
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:50,694
tell you mustache suits
you better? Oh! God.

1120
02:06:55,777 --> 02:06:58,678
Why is sudden discussion
of tune being right or

1121
02:06:58,747 --> 02:07:00,772
wrong? What happened Suma?

1122
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:05,684
Look, even when my tune
was right he hurt me

1123
02:07:05,754 --> 02:07:06,914
saying my tune is wrong.

1124
02:07:06,988 --> 02:07:09,513
Is it? Hey Manoj! If
you ever hurt my my

1125
02:07:09,591 --> 02:07:11,252

Brother, you'll were supposed

1129
02:07:20,936 --> 02:07:21,994
Where are you'll going?

To the fort.

02:07:23,538 --> 02:07:24,800
Even I am coming.

1132
02:07:24,873 --> 02:07:26,465
Manoj, why don't you
take Suma, she is

1133
02:07:26,541 --> 02:07:28,668
very familiar with the place.
You go with her.

1134
02:07:29,044 --> 02:07:31,672
I have to finish my office work.
It's a big headache.

1135
02:07:31,747 --> 02:07:35,808
Suma, you must know the place?
So you show him the place.

1136
02:07:35,884 --> 02:07:36,976
No, we both will go.

1137

So, you all are here?

1138
02:07:40,589 --> 02:07:44,025
Mother, can I go with
Praveen to the fort.

02:07:47,062 --> 02:07:48,654
and come back early in the evening.

1141

Sister, I heard that you are going
to the fort. Can I come with you?

1142
02:07:52,834 --> 02:07:53,926
Have you finished watering

02:07:54,002 --> 02:07:55,060
Yes.
- Hold this.

1144

Suma, sit here in the front
seat. I will sit behind.

1145
02:07:59,007 --> 02:08:01,976
Praveen, today you drive, so
that I can do some shoots.

1146
02:08:02,677 --> 02:08:03,837
Even I will sit behind.

1147
02:08:03,912 --> 02:08:05,004
You drive.

1148
02:08:44,653 --> 02:08:48,487
All of you sing. Who are you?
My sweet bird. I had

1149
02:08:48,557 --> 02:08:52,994
come for hunting and got
caught in your stare.

1150
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:12,103
What is wrong with you all?

1151
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:15,843
Master!  The last picnic to
Yana was more enjoyable.

1152
02:09:15,917 --> 02:09:16,975
Manoj, stop the car here.

1153
02:09:20,055 --> 02:09:21,613
There is a beautiful view on
the top, let us see that.

1154
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:22,782
No.

1155
02:09:22,858 --> 02:09:23,916
There is short cut from there.

1156
02:09:23,992 --> 02:09:26,620
It is only half kilometer.
We can walk it out.

1157
02:09:26,695 --> 02:09:27,855
Yes.

1158
02:09:34,636 --> 02:09:35,796

Aren't you coming?

1161
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,643
No, I have seen it many times
I will sit in the car.

1162
02:09:46,715 --> 02:09:47,807
Then why did you come?

1163
02:09:47,883 --> 02:09:50,647
For a drive in your car.

Fine then, we will go.
You sit in the car.

Look! It is because of you.
 - Look! It is because of you

1170
02:13:58,533 --> 02:14:00,626
My heart's desire like a bird,

1171
02:14:00,702 --> 02:14:03,000
Soars in the sky,

1172
02:14:08,643 --> 02:14:10,736
My heart's desire like a bird,

1173
02:14:10,812 --> 02:14:12,609
Soars in the sky,

1174
02:14:13,148 --> 02:14:14,979
Roams in the forest,

1175
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:17,642
Leaping around the fields,

1176
02:14:18,052 --> 02:14:20,680
In the Shimmering flowing river,

1177
02:14:20,755 --> 02:14:22,746
In the Falling water,

1178
02:14:23,158 --> 02:14:25,023
In the Shimmering flowing river,

1179
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:27,651
In the Falling water,

1180
02:14:27,729 --> 02:14:31,221
Say's it is in love

1181
02:14:33,001 --> 02:14:34,798
My heart's desire like a bird,

1182
02:14:34,869 --> 02:14:36,962
Soars in the sky,

1183
02:14:37,772 --> 02:14:39,637
Roams in the forest,

1184
02:14:39,707 --> 02:14:41,834
Leaping around the fields,

1185
02:15:14,943 --> 02:15:18,640
Chirping bird, do you know
the meaning of love?

1186
02:15:19,714 --> 02:15:21,682
The pleasant flutter of the heart,

1187
02:15:21,749 --> 02:15:23,649
The pleasant flutter of the heart,

1188
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:25,981
The pleasant flutter of the heart,

1189
02:15:26,888 --> 02:15:30,949
The Buzzing bee do you
know the ways of love?

1190
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:33,760
The feeling of calling in love,

1191
02:15:33,828 --> 02:15:35,762
The feeling of calling in love,

1192
02:15:36,631 --> 02:15:38,599
The feeling of calling in love,

1193
02:15:38,666 --> 02:15:40,634
Remembering the lover,

1194
02:15:40,702 --> 02:15:43,227
Looking at the swaying
green plants and trees,

1195
02:15:43,671 --> 02:15:45,002
Seeing the sprouted barren tree,

1196
02:15:45,807 --> 02:15:47,707
Seeing the green leaves,

1197
02:15:47,775 --> 02:15:50,005
In my house, and mind

1198
02:15:50,879 --> 02:15:52,779
In the mind and and soul,

1199
02:15:52,847 --> 02:15:55,680
In every thought and dreams,
I see him.

1200
02:15:55,750 --> 02:15:57,775
When beautiful love
comes. I feel him

1201
02:15:57,852 --> 02:15:59,752
My heart's desire like a bird,

1202
02:15:59,821 --> 02:16:02,016
Soars in the sky,

1203
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:04,715
Roams in the forest

1204
02:16:04,792 --> 02:16:06,885
Leaping around the fields,

1205
02:16:07,862 --> 02:16:09,796
In the Shimmering flowing river,

1206
02:16:09,864 --> 02:16:12,059
In the Falling water,

1207
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:20,665
Say's it is in love.

1208
02:16:21,976 --> 02:16:23,944
My heart's desire like a bird,

1209
02:16:24,679 --> 02:16:26,647
Soars in the sky,

1210
02:16:26,714 --> 02:16:28,807
Roams in the forest

Say's it is in love.

1213
02:17:03,718 --> 02:17:06,710
To be away from the love,
 - Misery came to life

1214
02:17:06,988 --> 02:17:08,683
Grief will come,

1215
02:17:08,756 --> 02:17:10,690
Grief will come,

1216
02:17:10,758 --> 02:17:13,022
Grief will come

1217
02:17:13,761 --> 02:17:15,661
For the heart not to ache,

1218
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:17,698
Not to hurt the lover,

1219
02:17:18,766 --> 02:17:20,666
Love is the only remedy
for heartache,

1220
02:17:20,735 --> 02:17:22,703
Love is the only remedy
for heartache,

1221
02:17:23,137 --> 02:17:24,968
Love is the only remedy
for heartache,

1222
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:27,669
Enjoyment found by the love,

1223
02:17:27,742 --> 02:17:29,801
Today is filled with anguish

1224
02:17:30,611 --> 02:17:32,636
Pleasure found in the companionship,

1225
02:17:32,714 --> 02:17:34,773
Is withered with despair,

1226
02:17:35,149 --> 02:17:42,885
In the colour of orange, in
the goodness of the earth,

1227
02:17:44,792 --> 02:17:46,657
My heart's desire like a bird,

1228
02:17:46,728 --> 02:17:48,719
Like the change in the season,

1229
02:17:49,797 --> 02:17:54,097
Like the sunset, spreading
the orange

1230
02:17:54,902 --> 02:17:59,236
Dreaming and hoping,
in happiness and pain

1231
02:17:59,907 --> 02:18:03,775
Dreaming and hoping,
in happiness and pain

1232
02:18:03,845 --> 02:18:07,713
I do not understand anything,

1233
02:18:08,783 --> 02:18:10,808
My heart's desire like a bird,

1234
02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:13,248
Like the change in the season,

1235
02:18:13,988 --> 02:18:17,947
Like the sunset, spreading
the orange

1236
02:18:21,529 --> 02:18:29,937
Master,  This is mine, this
is mine, do not drink mine.

1237
02:18:34,542 --> 02:18:43,473
Yours, mine, yours, mine.
Maruthi what will you

1238
02:18:43,551 --> 02:18:52,220
do if I drink from your bottle
without asking you?

1239
02:18:54,162 --> 02:18:57,029
You will not do that.
Why will you do that?

1240
02:18:57,665 --> 02:19:00,657
Even if you drink more I know
you will not do that?

1241
02:19:01,736 --> 02:19:02,896
What if I do that?

1242
02:19:03,971 --> 02:19:09,238
If you do that, then it is
like you are deceiving me.

1243
02:19:16,851 --> 02:19:24,451
Yes deceive, cheat you.  True,
true, I thought it was

1244
02:19:24,525 --> 02:19:33,957
mine, and snatched it from
you and cheated you.

1245
02:19:35,036 --> 02:19:36,196
What are you talking Master?

1246
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:38,636
Cheating! Maruthi, I am a cheat.

1247
02:19:38,706 --> 02:19:41,971
Yes I am a cheat.

1248
02:19:48,049 --> 02:19:49,744
Is cheating a sin?

1249
02:19:49,817 --> 02:19:50,875
Yes.

1250
02:19:51,486 --> 02:19:54,148
Sinners should be punished.

1251
02:19:55,890 --> 02:19:56,982
Why are you taking this
so seriously Master?

1252
02:19:58,659 --> 02:20:03,892
Is our name written on this
bottle yours and mine

1253
02:20:04,966 --> 02:20:10,962
If it is in your hand it is yours,
if it is in my hand it is mine.

1254
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:17,170
Fact is different and
we think differently.

1255
02:20:23,918 --> 02:20:27,945
Praveen, the fact is different
and we think differently..

1256
02:20:29,023 --> 02:20:34,791
I thought it is mine and cheated.
I am a cheater

1257
02:20:35,696 --> 02:20:37,186
What did you cheat?
Whom did you cheat?

1258
02:20:40,668 --> 02:20:41,794
Come let us go home.

1259
02:20:41,869 --> 02:20:46,738
Praveen Am I a cheat? Am I a cheat?

1260
02:20:46,807 --> 02:20:47,933
No, who told you that?

1261
02:20:50,011 --> 02:20:53,674
No I am not a cheat, I should
not cheat anyone.

1262
02:20:54,749 --> 02:20:56,979
I am a cheat, is it not Jaji?

1263
02:21:00,655 --> 02:21:01,883
Come let us go home.

1264
02:21:04,692 --> 02:21:06,489
Not now, what if mother
know that I am drunk?

1265
02:21:06,561 --> 02:21:07,994
You go I will come after sometime.

1266
02:21:15,069 --> 02:21:17,902
Okay, we will go after
you sober down.

1267
02:21:30,618 --> 02:21:31,778
Jaji!

1268
02:21:38,593 --> 02:21:45,658
Praveen I know that you
are in love with Suma.

1269
02:22:05,753 --> 02:22:07,687
Praveen come here

1270
02:22:28,709 --> 02:22:29,937
Sudha told me everything.

1271
02:22:31,846 --> 02:22:35,612
You have a great heart
like your father.

1272
02:22:37,685 --> 02:22:41,177
Even I wished Suma would
be my daughter -in -law.

1273
02:22:41,822 --> 02:22:45,656
But things does not
happens like we wish.

1274
02:22:46,727 --> 02:22:51,630
To gain something we have
to lose something.

1275
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:56,466
To save your friendship..

1276
02:22:56,537 --> 02:23:01,975
..you are sacrificing your
love. God will bless

1277
02:23:02,043 --> 02:23:04,773
you child. Bless you my child.

1278
02:23:09,850 --> 02:23:12,683
Mother, will you do me a favour,
you have to lie to

1279
02:23:17,591 --> 02:23:19,422
Manoj that I am being engaged..

1280
02:23:19,493 --> 02:23:22,587
..to my Uncle's daughter
in Dharwar, he has

1281
02:23:22,663 --> 02:23:28,602
misunderstood that I am in love..

1282
02:23:28,669 --> 02:23:34,630
..with Sumi, so he is going
away.  That should not

1283
02:23:34,709 --> 02:23:40,807
happen, Sumi and Manoj..

1284
02:23:40,881 --> 02:23:48,617
..should be one. Mother,
I know you have

1285
02:23:48,689 --> 02:23:56,460
taught me not to lie. Please!..

1286
02:23:56,530 --> 02:24:01,866
..Mother, tell this
one lie for my sake.

1287
02:24:02,937 --> 02:24:03,995
Then everything will be all right.

1288
02:24:04,071 --> 02:24:06,665
Brother before making
mother lie, please

1289
02:24:06,741 --> 02:24:12,737
think over this. Or else
you will regret it life.

1290
02:24:12,813 --> 02:24:18,752
Sudha you do not understand this.
My happiness is in this.

1291
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:26,885
Please mother, tell
one lie for my sake.

1292
02:24:31,966 --> 02:24:34,230
Marriage! Girl Whose marriage?

1293
02:24:34,668 --> 02:24:40,800
Praveen's! With my brother's
daughter. So he did not tell this.

1294
02:24:40,875 --> 02:24:44,504
I thought of speaking to your
parents. If both of you

1295
02:24:44,578 --> 02:24:45,909
could get married together..

1296
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:47,038
..I would be a grand occasion.

1297
02:24:47,114 --> 02:24:48,172
You must be joking with me.

1298
02:24:48,682 --> 02:24:49,842
Why would I joke?

1299
02:24:54,188 --> 02:24:57,055
Mother, Praveen would not
agree to this marriage.

1300
02:24:58,025 --> 02:25:00,118
Why not? He has agreed to this.

1301
02:25:00,694 --> 02:25:01,991
Mother you are lying.

1302
02:25:02,062 --> 02:25:04,724
Why would I lie? If
you want you ask him.

1303
02:25:04,799 --> 02:25:07,267
It is impossible for him to
agree to this marriage,

1304
02:25:08,035 --> 02:25:12,028
because he is in love with a girl.

1305
02:25:13,707 --> 02:25:15,072
Hey!  Tell mother.

1306
02:25:16,076 --> 02:25:17,805
Don't I know my Praveen very well?

1307
02:25:18,145 --> 02:25:19,476
He will agree to the
girl of my choice..

1308
02:25:19,547 --> 02:25:22,744
..and you get married
to the girl you love.

1309
02:25:24,652 --> 02:25:25,880
Mother, the girl is no one else.

1310
02:25:26,954 --> 02:25:30,685
It is Suma he loves. He
will marry only her.

1311
02:25:30,758 --> 02:25:38,756
You have mistaken, they are
childhood friends nothing else.

1312
02:25:38,833 --> 02:25:39,993
No, mother.

1313
02:25:48,909 --> 02:25:53,243
Manoj it is time for dinner, come.

1314
02:25:54,682 --> 02:25:55,910
Let Manoj come.

1315
02:26:42,963 --> 02:26:44,021
Jaji.

1316
02:27:03,117 --> 02:27:08,020
Manoj, how could you do this,
I had lot of respect to

1317
02:27:08,088 --> 02:27:09,953
you? I did not know you would
turn out to be like this.

1318
02:27:11,125 --> 02:27:17,621
Yes speak Jaji, respect,

1319
02:27:17,698 --> 02:27:26,003
..Iove,
dreams, desires,

1320
02:27:26,707 --> 02:27:31,770
friendship, disgust, sex, jealous..

1321
02:27:31,845 --> 02:27:38,045
..pain, friendship, love,
hatred, jealous,

1322
02:27:38,118 --> 02:27:41,849
Iongings these are all feelings.

1323
02:27:42,089 --> 02:27:47,823
We all fall prey into these
feelings and suffer, from

1324
02:27:48,729 --> 02:27:52,722
Iove to jealously,
then pain, sorrow..

1325
02:27:54,001 --> 02:27:58,938
In love, we dream build
false hopes and once the

1326
02:27:59,006 --> 02:28:04,569
dream is shattered the
feelings changes..

1327
02:28:05,079 --> 02:28:09,675
..from respect to disgust from
love to contempt I want

1328
02:28:10,117 --> 02:28:14,918
feelings to change,
this is what I want.

1329
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:19,787
You had told me that you would
give me your life to

1330
02:28:21,061 --> 02:28:24,758
see me happy. I want
a help from you..

1331
02:28:24,832 --> 02:28:26,800
..all I want is help, not sex,
I do not have that feeling..

1332
02:28:26,867 --> 02:28:28,926
for you. You are my friend,
I only acted with you

1333
02:28:29,003 --> 02:28:30,766
..only act. When in act, without
knowing it as act,

1334
02:28:30,838 --> 02:28:37,073
thinking it as true
the feelings change.

1335
02:28:37,144 --> 02:28:39,908
I do not understand
what you are talking.

1336
02:28:40,781 --> 02:28:43,841
You are in love with Suma is it not?

1337
02:28:43,917 --> 02:28:49,082
Suma is in love with me. She
is dreaming of a happy

1338
02:28:49,156 --> 02:28:52,819
Iife with me. It should
not be like that..

1339
02:28:52,893 --> 02:28:56,226
..otherwise it will cause her
endless pain.  This is how

1340
02:28:57,031 --> 02:29:02,833
pain is caused. So even
if it hurts her now..

1341
02:29:02,903 --> 02:29:07,738
..Iater on she can be
happy. I want her

1342
02:29:08,642 --> 02:29:12,669
to stop loving me. I
want her to hate me.

1343
02:29:13,814 --> 02:29:14,872
I need your help for that.

1344
02:29:15,182 --> 02:29:18,811
I will not help you. If I do,
it is like committing

1345
02:29:18,886 --> 02:29:23,914
a sin. You do not know
the meaning of love.

1346
02:29:23,991 --> 02:29:26,118
Yes I do not know, and
I don't want to know.

1347
02:29:26,193 --> 02:29:30,129
The solution to your problem
is to get married to Suma.

1348
02:29:31,131 --> 02:29:36,626
Jaji, like my love my friendship
is also important to me.

1349
02:29:38,906 --> 02:29:41,898
Praveen, Praveen is
in love with Suma.

1350
02:29:41,975 --> 02:29:44,944
Lie!  This is what you assume.
I had heard Praveen

1351
02:29:45,112 --> 02:29:49,913
talk to Kamala regarding
your marriage.

1352
02:29:54,154 --> 02:29:56,850
That is why? I am asking your help.

1353
02:29:57,091 --> 02:30:00,549
It is not good to hurt a
loving heart it is a sin.

1354
02:30:00,627 --> 02:30:03,061
Let me take the burden of
this sin. I am a sinner.

1355
02:30:05,833 --> 02:30:08,961
Forget it, I thought
you are my friend..

1356
02:30:09,036 --> 02:30:12,904
..and I thought I could
ask a friend to help me.

1357
02:30:13,707 --> 02:30:14,765
Tell me what should I do now?

1358
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:21,673
Act to be in love with me.

1359
02:30:24,051 --> 02:30:28,010
I do not want anyone's life
ruined because of me.

1360
02:30:29,890 --> 02:30:32,017
That is why this act.

1361
02:30:32,793 --> 02:30:36,627
You have to tell Suma that
I am living with Jaji.

1362
02:30:36,697 --> 02:30:38,028
How could I hurt her feelings?

1363
02:30:38,098 --> 02:30:43,001
Please! See that Suma comes
to see me and I will

1364
02:30:46,006 --> 02:30:53,879
see that everything else
will be okay. Please.

1365
02:30:54,782 --> 02:30:58,843
His relation that too with Jaji,
dirty, dirty.  Today when

1366
02:30:58,919 --> 02:31:03,788
he comes home, I will
not let him inside..

1367
02:31:03,857 --> 02:31:07,816
..the threshold, I will throw
all his clothes out. He

1368
02:31:07,895 --> 02:31:12,923
does not want a good girl
he is after a prostitute.

1369
02:32:55,102 --> 02:32:57,468
Are you out of senses?
Why are you lying?

1370
02:32:57,537 --> 02:32:59,471
You can see with your own eyes.

1371
02:32:59,806 --> 02:33:02,832
Both of them are together enjoying.

1372
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:11,845
Bhatt, Bhatt.

1373
02:33:12,819 --> 02:33:16,778
I feel that doing this will
solve my problem. I am sorry

1374
02:33:16,857 --> 02:33:23,820
if I have hurt your feelings.
Please bear with me, Jaji.

1375
02:33:23,897 --> 02:33:27,424
Your intention is good, so
everything will be good.

1376
02:33:31,104 --> 02:33:32,162
Do not worry. Suma is coming.

1377
02:33:34,841 --> 02:33:37,036
Do not get scared.

1378
02:34:09,576 --> 02:34:10,634
Suma!

1379
02:34:22,723 --> 02:34:26,181
Look, Suma there are certain
personal matters

1380
02:34:27,828 --> 02:34:30,092
I have not discussed with

1381
02:34:31,832 --> 02:34:36,929
..Iike I smoke, I drink and
women.  That too women,

1382
02:34:37,004 --> 02:34:40,804
they are my weakness.
I like to enjoy..

1383
02:34:40,874 --> 02:34:47,006
..the women I befriend.
I love sex and women.

1384
02:34:48,181 --> 02:34:52,515
It is my habit, sameway..

1385
02:34:52,586 --> 02:34:57,216
..I
liked this Jaji, that's it.

1386
02:35:08,201 --> 02:35:11,898
Come, enjoy me. Come.
You enjoy any woman you

1387
02:35:11,972 --> 02:35:15,772
meet is it so? You love
sex, come man..

1388
02:35:15,842 --> 02:35:23,647
..come have sex with me.
I will be new girl

1389
02:35:24,918 --> 02:35:29,821
in your list of girls. Come enjoy.

1390
02:35:30,824 --> 02:35:34,954
Why? Why are you standing
like that? You did not

1391
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:41,797
Iike my body? Did you not
like? Yes, how can..

1392
02:35:41,868 --> 02:35:43,665
..you when you were acting?
Why are involving

1393
02:35:43,737 --> 02:35:45,034
that poor girl in your act?

1394
02:35:47,174 --> 02:35:50,837
From the day you came to
my life, I know you very

1395
02:35:51,078 --> 02:35:53,774
well. Why are you trying to
create a wrong opinion..

1396
02:35:53,847 --> 02:35:57,806
..for you in my heart. My heart
understands this. Why?

1397
02:35:57,884 --> 02:35:59,818
acting like this? What
wrong have I done

1398
02:35:59,886 --> 02:36:01,854
Why are you hurting me so
much? Why are trying to

1399
02:36:01,922 --> 02:36:02,980
distance yourself from me.

1400
02:36:03,056 --> 02:36:08,790
Because of me. Because of
me, Suma.

1401
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:14,565
All this is

1402
02:36:15,135 --> 02:36:20,903
happening because of me.
 This act is for me.

1403
02:36:22,742 --> 02:36:27,076
He is hurting you because
of me. He thinks that

1404
02:36:28,148 --> 02:36:30,776
If he does this, you will
start hating him..

1405
02:36:30,851 --> 02:36:35,845
..and go away from him.
By doing that he thinks

1406
02:36:35,922 --> 02:36:42,760
he is doing me a favour. So
he is doing this cheap act.

1407
02:36:42,829 --> 02:36:43,887
Because of you?

1408
02:36:44,498 --> 02:36:53,065
Yes, he has misunderstood
that I am in love with you.

1409
02:36:54,674 --> 02:37:00,112
What, misunderstood? Repeat that.

1410
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:01,838
Yes, misunderstood.

1411
02:37:02,682 --> 02:37:03,740
Say it once more more.

1412
02:37:03,817 --> 02:37:06,809
Why once, I will say
that thousand times,

1413
02:37:06,887 --> 02:37:08,912
that you have misunderstood me

1414
02:37:08,989 --> 02:37:13,926
Why thousand times?
Look into Suma's eyes

1415
02:37:14,861 --> 02:37:16,954
and say only once that
you do not love her.

1416
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:28,198
Praveen?

1417
02:37:28,275 --> 02:37:30,937
Yes, Suma yes, Praveen loves you.

1418
02:37:32,913 --> 02:37:36,815
Suma, he loves you more than
anyone else in the world.

1419
02:37:36,883 --> 02:37:37,941
Manoj!

1420
02:37:38,852 --> 02:37:40,820
He loves you more than his life.

1421
02:37:41,755 --> 02:37:43,222
He has loved you from childhood.

1422
02:37:44,558 --> 02:37:45,957
But you never understood, Suma.

1423
02:37:46,026 --> 02:37:49,086
He could not tell you and you
never tried to understand.

1424
02:37:49,796 --> 02:37:52,230
Yeh! Praveen, atleast tell her now,

1425
02:37:52,999 --> 02:37:56,230
what you could not tell for
the last fifteen years.

1426
02:37:56,703 --> 02:37:59,763
Now the love of your life is right
in front of you.  Tell Praveen,

1427
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:02,099
Come on man, come on.

1428
02:38:02,175 --> 02:38:05,633
Come on, tell the truth
Admt it, I say, admit!

1429
02:38:05,712 --> 02:38:12,777
Yes! I love Suma. Yes, l
have loved her since l..

1430
02:38:12,852 --> 02:38:14,046
was this small.

1431
02:38:14,654 --> 02:38:21,651
Many times I tried
telling you this..

1432
02:38:21,728 --> 02:38:28,793
..but I could not. Yes,
yes, I had..

1433
02:38:28,868 --> 02:38:36,468
wooven beautiful dreams
about you, it is true.

1434
02:38:36,910 --> 02:38:39,970
But the naked truth is Manoj
also loves you, more than me.

1435
02:38:40,046 --> 02:38:41,536
Praveen! Shut up,

1436
02:38:41,615 --> 02:38:42,673
you shut up, shut up.

1437
02:38:43,683 --> 02:38:46,550
..Suma, you should marry Manoj.

1438
02:38:46,886 --> 02:38:48,683
I am not telling you this because
he will make you a singer..

1439
02:38:48,755 --> 02:38:49,813
..not because he is my friend,

1440
02:38:49,889 --> 02:38:51,686
but because he is a good human..

1441
02:38:51,758 --> 02:38:53,817
he is a very good man.

1442
02:38:53,893 --> 02:38:58,557
He is better than me in all ways.
You should marry him.

1443
02:38:58,632 --> 02:39:01,499
Yeh! Stop it, stop it,
and shut up. Look Suma,

1444
02:39:02,002 --> 02:39:04,903
what I could not tell
you in so many days..

1445
02:39:04,971 --> 02:39:06,029
..I am telling you now.

1446
02:39:06,706 --> 02:39:09,038
Look, look, try to understand me,

1447
02:39:09,509 --> 02:39:12,910
understand.  Try to forget
whatever happened..

1448
02:39:12,979 --> 02:39:15,038
..between us. You have to forget.

1449
02:39:15,548 --> 02:39:16,913
Praveen is the right man for you.

1450
02:39:18,451 --> 02:39:20,510
I came in between your
relation, that..

1451
02:39:20,587 --> 02:39:23,454
..was my mistake. We will
make up for it now.

1452
02:39:24,958 --> 02:39:27,017
You both should be one,
get married..

1453
02:39:27,093 --> 02:39:30,460
..only then this problem
will be solved.

1454
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:33,124
You, keep quiet, you, keep quiet.
Suma, think practically.

1455
02:39:33,199 --> 02:39:35,997
Try to understand his love for you.

1456
02:39:36,536 --> 02:39:38,868
Do not lose him do not,
please, please.

1457
02:39:38,938 --> 02:39:43,671
Wah! Wah! You both
should be admired.

1458
02:39:43,743 --> 02:39:45,540
What is an acute friendship
should be learnt from you.

1459
02:39:46,179 --> 02:39:51,014
One is ready to sacrifice his
love and the other his dreams.

1460
02:39:51,651 --> 02:39:58,147
What do you I am? A toy?

1461
02:39:58,558 --> 02:40:00,617
If you don't want, give it to him,

1462
02:40:00,694 --> 02:40:01,820
and if you don't want
give it back to him.

1463
02:40:02,929 --> 02:40:08,561
Did you ever think that
I too have a mind?

1464
02:40:08,668 --> 02:40:13,731
You men never understand what
is in a woman's mind..

1465
02:40:13,807 --> 02:40:17,971
..and you will never understand.
Praveen,

1466
02:40:18,044 --> 02:40:21,104
if the feeling of love has awaken..

1467
02:40:21,181 --> 02:40:22,512
in your heart it is not my fault,
Praveen, it is your fault.

1468
02:40:23,616 --> 02:40:25,675
Your never loved me, Praveen.You
just loved..

1469
02:40:25,752 --> 02:40:26,810
the feeling of loving me.

1470
02:40:26,886 --> 02:40:30,845
With that feeling of love you
built dreams of me, Praveen.

1471
02:40:30,924 --> 02:40:35,987
That is why you never expressed
your love to me,

1472
02:40:36,062 --> 02:40:40,123
if you had told me, I would
have told you then..

1473
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,532
..that I have given my heart
to Manoj, Praveen.

1474
02:40:42,769 --> 02:40:45,203
My heart should go to him.

1475
02:40:45,939 --> 02:40:47,998
Heart and mind can be given only..

1476
02:40:48,074 --> 02:40:51,737
to one person in life, Praveen.
 That is nature.

1477
02:40:51,811 --> 02:40:52,869
Suma, it could also be like this.

1478
02:40:52,946 --> 02:40:55,744
No, Manoj, it cannot be
like this or like that.

1479
02:40:55,815 --> 02:40:58,875
It cannot be any other way.
You are my lover..

1480
02:40:58,952 --> 02:41:00,943
..and he is my friend, that's all.

1481
02:41:01,921 --> 02:41:03,013
Do not..

1482
02:41:03,089 --> 02:41:04,215
misunderstand relations.

1483
02:41:04,758 --> 02:41:05,816
One cannot take..

1484
02:41:05,892 --> 02:41:10,090
..the place of the other
. Praveen, you..

1485
02:41:10,163 --> 02:41:12,961
have misinterpreted love.

1486
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:15,491
Two hands should join for a clap.

1487
02:41:16,536 --> 02:41:19,767
It's true, that two hands
join for a clap..

1488
02:41:22,742 --> 02:41:26,644
..but we can snap with one hand,
it's sound is also melodically..

1489
02:41:27,514 --> 02:41:31,575
Praveen, we can snap with
one hand, but not clap.

1490
02:41:31,684 --> 02:41:33,015
Look snaping is different
and clapping..

1491
02:41:33,086 --> 02:41:34,178
..is different.

1492
02:41:34,721 --> 02:41:36,916
Don't try to say that both are same.

1493
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:41,185
Love is like a clap two
hearts should join.

1494
02:41:41,594 --> 02:41:45,121
I never had that feelings towards
you and it will never come.

1495
02:41:45,899 --> 02:41:48,925
You are my very dearest friend.

1496
02:41:49,769 --> 02:41:54,069
If my words have hurt you,
it is not my fault.

1497
02:41:55,542 --> 02:41:56,600
You, have to change the..

1498
02:41:56,676 --> 02:41:58,143
..feelings you have developed
towards me, that is all.

1499
02:41:58,478 --> 02:42:01,208
Suma, will you start loving me,

1500
02:42:01,948 --> 02:42:03,210
can you start loving me, now?

1501
02:42:03,950 --> 02:42:05,008
Praveen!

1502
02:42:05,718 --> 02:42:07,777
You cannot, can you? No,
just like you..

1503
02:42:07,854 --> 02:42:11,221
cannot develop the feelings
of love towards me.

1504
02:42:11,658 --> 02:42:14,218
In the same way I cannot change
my feelings towards you.

1505
02:42:14,761 --> 02:42:16,752
Look whatever you said is true.

1506
02:42:17,797 --> 02:42:19,924
Like I am your friend,
friendship is..

1507
02:42:19,999 --> 02:42:21,591
a beautiful relation,
its true, true.

1508
02:42:21,801 --> 02:42:26,898
The mind understands
all this, but this?

1509
02:42:28,575 --> 02:42:33,638
That is why we cannot develop
or erase feelings, it..

1510
02:42:33,713 --> 02:42:39,049
develops as it is and
changes with time.

1511
02:42:42,522 --> 02:42:47,050
Meaning to a beautiful life
is to understand each other.

1512
02:42:47,126 --> 02:42:48,184
And it has happened.

1513
02:42:48,528 --> 02:42:53,056
So, let us live like this.
Let us be Happy, happy.

1514
02:43:05,011 --> 02:43:06,069
Bye.
