538
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,118

539
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,986
- Serve it to the fancy dress
and ask him to be quite...

540
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,227
- To whom?
- That duplicate of Bapu

541
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,251
Where?

542
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,654
There you can't see him

543
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,796
Everyone crazy come over here

544
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,104
Who are you?

545
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,173
You can call me Bapu

546
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,872
Don't touch me

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,787
Don't be afraid, l never
harm anybody till that day

548
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,948
Boss, here is some problem

549
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,092
Are you not a soul?

550
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,728
You can call me spirit instead of Soul

551
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,892
- l'm unable to understand Baap (Father)
- Not Baap (Father), lt's Bapu (Gandhi)

552
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,698
You love to much with Janvi

553
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,232
You'll going to her home on Sunday

554
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,368
How can you know?

555
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,303

00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,643
- l come to help you
- Hari Ram

557
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,405

558
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,575
Whenever you need me call me

559
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,182

560

562
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,258
Who's it?

563
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,234
lllusion, what is this?

564
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,972
May times you hear voices due to the...

565
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,875
...mental tiredness and
the chemical imbalance

566
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:42,175
See that kind of things that's
not real... that's illumination

567
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,575
Mahatma Gandhi was there
l saw him over there

568
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,181
He's the soul of Bapu

569
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,824
lf there's a sprit then why
only you're able to see him

570
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,194
lt depends upon the mood of the sprit

571
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,230
From past three nights
you are researching...

572
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,899
...on Gandhi without
having rest and food

573
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:06,671
That's why a restless
mind show you Gandhi Ji.

574
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,231
What do you mean to say? that l'm Mad...

575

Bapu, would you like to have
cold rink, tea or anything?

603
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,991
You mental hospital

604
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,450
What're you saying?

605
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:43,701
l know that there is no Bapu
and why are you spoiling his mind

606
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,793

607
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:45,999

Because of you will power
he came out from the book

612
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,950
Just like Aladdin's lamp

l went also along with you

614
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,916
lt's Gandhi... that's
why he says hello to us

615
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,851
Don't take any kind of tension

616

our country he returns back

00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,439
He said, he's going to help us

621
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,236

You can't walk on the
footpath because of the shops

lf the bed is available
then there is no one for care

702
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,181
Nobody going to solve your complaints

703
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,317
Ask the minister and

00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,716

01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:35,801
lt's very clear in the horoscope
that if this wedding will happens

1059
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,202
Sunny can't live more then a year

1060
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:41,943
That's confirm...

1061
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:46,737
- Khorana Ji... ln this century
- l can't ignore his fortunetelling

1062
01:10:47,183 --> 01:10:51,142
What ever we are today it's
just because of Battook Maharaj

1063
01:10:51,554 --> 01:10:53,317
We lost our factories

1064
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:57,626
He said, put one more 'K' in Khorana

1065
01:10:57,626 --> 01:11:00,220
Look... today where're we

1066
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:06,499
lf your daughter born after few
hours then the fate will be different

1067
01:11:08,337 --> 01:11:09,599
Bad timing Ji...

1068
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:18,777
lf you gave birth to simran after
5 minutes then the date was changed

1069
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:21,650
How can date been changed

1070
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:23,886
Simran was born at 1 1 :55 correct

1071
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:24,853
- Yes

1072
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:29,947
lf you hold on for five more minutes
then 7 April changed in to 8th April

1073
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:33,554
- Understand my words?
- One minute... One minute

1074
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:38,000
Your daughter was born
at 1 1 :55am in morning

1075
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,903
No... No... at 1 1 :55 pm

1076
01:11:40,903 --> 01:11:44,440
- lt was night
- No... No... you tell me... Look...

1077
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,407
Look that...

01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:58,314
Our typist now he's def

1082
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:00,890
He's lip-read the dictation

1083
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,759
am, pm shows same in lip-read am, pm

1084
01:12:03,759 --> 01:12:04,691
lt's a big problem

1085
01:12:04,827 --> 01:12:08,831
He writes lawyer as liar and
risky business as whiskey business

1086
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:12,434
Once l tell him that wrote down the
cement Supplier ''send us an email''

1087
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,767
He wrote, Send us a female

1088
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:19,041
and he sends because of the order

1089
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,566
Very embarrassing situation in office

1090
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:27,183
Koko buy a big machine
for Subramaniyum's ear

1091
01:12:27,183 --> 01:12:28,250
Who's Subramaniyum?

1092
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,554
Buy two machine for both ears,
its doesn't makes any difference

get me loud and clear

He's a great lawyer, he studied in
London and practiced in South Africa

1229
01:21:52,547 --> 01:21:55,350
He said, don't use harm

01:21:58,153 --> 01:22:02,257
- lf enemy gives you harm then give him a smile
- Ghuju Said this?

1232
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:06,785
Hey Said that, lf someone slaps you on your
left cheek then give him your right cheek

1233
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:11,324
lf you do that, it controls
his anger and raze your respect

1234
01:22:12,868 --> 01:22:17,973
He also said, if you try win's your enemy
heart then there is no need of lawyers

1235
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:19,372
Who said this? Who said that?

1236
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:25,774
Move...

1242
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:01,550

that roses are unlucky for them

1249

Khorana uncle, cut all
the roses of his home

1250
01:23:20,902 --> 01:23:27,398
and he changed the name of her
sectary from rosés to chambali

1251
01:23:28,743 --> 01:23:31,177
How can sunny bare his father

1252
01:23:31,646 --> 01:23:33,081
because his father is a good man

1253
01:23:33,081 --> 01:23:35,350
He's a little bit
superstitious, but its ok

1254
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,253
Little bit... without any fortune
decision he can't go to washroom

1255
01:23:38,253 --> 01:23:40,989
Already he placed two ''KK''

1289
01:26:37,065 --> 01:26:37,724

01:26:44,339 --> 01:26:46,068
- Beat them all
- No... No...

1291
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:52,313
Bapu says, if enemy hits you on you
right cheek then present him the left one

1292
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:55,009
Here it is... Look nothing is happens

1293
01:26:57,318 --> 01:26:58,580
Bhai he done it

1294
01:27:05,827 --> 01:27:07,962
When slapped on both
cheeks then what to do?

1295
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,831
That's not addressed by the Bapu

1296
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:13,468
Munna, let them do...

1297
01:27:13,468 --> 01:27:15,129
But you don't fight them

1298
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:19,095
That changes the mood of your enemy

1299
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:23,078
His odium decreases and
increases you respect

1300
01:27:23,078 --> 01:27:27,447
Show him that we can't hit him

1301
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:29,578
Neither we're going to leave our path

1302
01:27:30,452 --> 01:27:33,182
Go Munna and ask him for forgiveness

1303
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:39,260
We'll take back the house
with peace, if you do...

1304
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,228
...some thing wrong then we
going to give you a bamboo

1305
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:45,800
- Say sorry to him
- But why Bhai?

1306
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,339
Look... Bapu says if l do this then it'll
decrease there odium and increase our respect

1307
01:27:51,339 --> 01:27:54,433
- Say sorry to him
- Bapu going to shatter our business

1308
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,803
- l'm sorry
- Now get up we're sorry

1309
01:27:59,547 --> 01:28:00,809
Get up or l'm going to hit you

1310
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:07,311
- Bhai

1311
01:28:08,356 --> 01:28:10,950

1313
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:19,966
More of less we broke 250 bones

1314
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:22,897
but never sentence to jail

1315
01:28:24,172 --> 01:28:27,475
First time... First time...
We say sorry to some one

1316
01:28:27,475 --> 01:28:28,442
and sentence to jail

1317
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,438
Public going to laugh at us

1318
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:36,617
Our reputation is ended

1319
01:28:37,018 --> 01:28:40,454
lf you sentenced to jail after murdering
some one then it'll increases your respect?

1320
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,954
But the must charged us in kidnapping

1321
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:47,624
Do you know that...?
Bapu only made the salt

1322
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:49,461
and he sentence to jail directly

1323
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:52,828
- What about his reputation
- No...

1324
01:28:54,035 --> 01:28:57,368
His reputation increases buy
the which he spent in the jail

1325
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:58,604
because he's right

1326
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,043
lf we sentence to jail after
doing right things then...

1327
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:04,511
Then our sculpture will
place in the park after death

01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:09,176

You don't know the name of your mother

lf Gandhi Ji is a reality

1736
02:01:09,602 --> 02:01:13,806
Then he must tell Mr.
Sharma the name of his mother

02:15:03,869 --> 02:15:04,198
Uncle

1978

That person who are not sure about his
future then how come he tell others future

1979
02:15:10,442 --> 02:15:11,875
Don't stop this marriage

1980
02:15:12,377 --> 02:15:13,605
l'm requesting you

1981
02:15:15,981 --> 02:15:18,381
Somebody try to explain him

Somebody tell him anything

l'm a mad person

1984
02:15:24,489 --> 02:15:27,059
But l can see it clear that
something is happening wrong

1985
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:29,857
You smart peoples can't
understand this thing...

1986
02:15:39,938 --> 02:15:43,499
Circuit it's better that
Bapu is not in reality

1987
02:15:44,543 --> 02:15:49,310
lf today he's here, then he'll
cry after seeing this scary nation

1988
02:15:50,615 --> 02:15:52,549
He died saying this that speak the truth

1989
02:15:53,485 --> 02:15:56,386
But today if somebody speaks the
truth then people are going to bust him

That girl dare to do
it.... then guests returns

Where is Sunny?

1998
02:16:41,166 --> 02:16:43,634
Sunny... Go...

1999
02:16:44,169 --> 02:16:44,931

lf l'll marry Simran

But what can l do?

When you say ''Good Morning Mumbai''

2011
02:17:36,621 --> 02:17:39,681
Then sunlight came to my life

2012
02:17:43,562 --> 02:17:46,326
