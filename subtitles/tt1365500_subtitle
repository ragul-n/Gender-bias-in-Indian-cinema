1
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,755
 Oh! New Rose!

2
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,927
 Blossomed Rose!

3
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,037
 What will you do with me?

4
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,610
 Even if you kill me...

5
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,113
 Even if fire consumes me...

6
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,114
 I'll go around you only!

7
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,552
 My Love, with gesture of your eye.

8
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,623
 ...With your smile...
 ...It has blossomed in my heart.

9
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,962
 Cluster of Roses!
 -Cluster of Roses.

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,968
 You're a Cluster of Rose!

11
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,969
 It's roses all the way
 in my heart.

12
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,473
 If there's no love this world
 is a grave.

13
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,649
 If a lover is sleeping even a
 grave is a Temple.

14
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,826
 Love will teach parents,
 Teachers & poets also.

15
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,169
 My lover, your curves..

16
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,007
 Your curves have blossomed
 in my heart...

17
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,013
 A cluster of Roses!
 A cluster of Roses...

18
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,852
 You're a cluster of roses.

19
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,853
 A cluster of roses in my heart.

20
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,398
 Greetings to everyone.

21
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,899
 I'm llango.

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,900
 This Cluster of Roses is a medley
 of incidents in my life.

23
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,073
 He's my close friend, Sriram.

24
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,074
 He's exactly what my father
 aspires me to be.

25
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,579
 Responsible man!

26
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,747
 Next is Arumugam.
 He's my classmate.

27
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,549
 Stopping his college studies mid way.

28
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,419
 Saying studies is a waste.
 -He's running an Auto.

29
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,087
 He's an Auto Driver.

30
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,088
 In my house my mom & dad
 never fight.

31
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,592
 If there's a fight!

32
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,927
 ...It must definitely be
 over me only.

33
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,597
 Unable to study well, I'm saying
 I want to do business.

34
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,598
 Finish atleast graduation, father is
 saying, he'll finance my business.

35
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,101
 With no other way!

36
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,102
 I'm going to pay arrears fee, with the
 help of my father's friend.

37
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,607
 Time's up! If I don't pay fee
 in another 10 minutes...

38
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,610
 ...That's all.

39
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,139
 l've parked a blue Saffire
 next to your bike.

40
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
 Will you tell me if I've
 locked it properly?

41
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,084
 It's locked, isn't it.

42
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,919
 Please, tell me.

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,154
 Voice is good.

44
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,922
 Let me see her face also.

45
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,990
 It isn't locked.

46
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,991
 Oh! God!

47
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,028
 It is locked only.

48
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,715
 Why did he do like that?

49
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,233
 No mother!-Have it, son.

50
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,072
 Slowly...one after the other.
 Brother eat..

51
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,578
 Enough...enough...enough.

52
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,579
 Come!

53
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,081
 Come, llango.

54
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,583
 What's this? Looks like you're getting
 drenched in Love rain.

55
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,751
 Take this.

56
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,752
 Getting born as a lone son in a home
 full of girls is difficult...

57
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,090
 Shut up...
 You come.

58
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,091
 Let it be here, I'll take it
 while going.

59
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,429
 Your father told you to meet some one
 regarding arrears exam.

60
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,098
 Did you meet him?
 I met...

61
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,266
 Very beautiful!

62
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,267
 Azhaga? He said, it's Ramamurthy.

63
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,270
 I met a girl when I went
 to meet him.

64
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,776
 That girl is beautiful.

65
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,615
 Look, if you write & pass this exam.

66
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,717
 Your father promised to finance
 your business, isn't it?

67
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,952
 Why're you going after girls?

68
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,455
 Control your mind.

69
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,791
 If you wear specs!

70
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,793
 You'll be exactly like Thiagarajan.

71
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,794
 Which Thiagarajan?

72
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,062
 My father only!

73
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,398
 How happy it is to see crowd
 in a cinema theatre?

74
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,399
 If crowds get thinner they're demolishing
 & building shopping malls.

75
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,404
 This is no parking area
 move out your vehicle.

76
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,405
 I know it! First customer
 Meter showed Rs.45.

77
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,242
 She gave Rs.100, what can I do?

78
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,244
 That's why, she went saying
 she'll send her friend.

79
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,746
 I'll move out as soon as she comes.

80
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,915
 Do you've permit?
 -No permit.

81
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,250
 Who's the owner?
 Bajaj.

82
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,752
 Shouldn't you tell me
 that earlier itself?

83
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,353
 You've asked me just now, isn't it?

84
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,354
 Okay,if sir comes,tell him to give
 extra for Deepavali. Who? Mr.Bajaj?

85
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,859
 Yes. - He has gone out of station
 with Mr.Kawasaki.

86
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,760
 I'll ask & give you as soon as
 he comes back.

87
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,761
 Will you tell him without fail?
 -Okay! Shall I go?

88
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,933
 Bajaj is Auto company's name.

89
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,934
 And he's thinking him to
 be this Auto's owner.

90
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,774
 Hi, buddy.

91
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,775
 Come here.

92
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,448
 Are you going to the
 Theatre's canteen?

93
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,716
 Order a Tea for me, Please!

94
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,717
 Look at him! Silly Idiot, asking tea.
 If I punch, you're finished.

95
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,287
 Oh! A local girl in a
 modern dress.

96
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,959
 Come, friend, Bike Tyson.

97
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,894
 Buddy! Are you here to
 watch the movie?

98
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,963
 Are they playing unauthorized
 CD's here?

99
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,631
 I'm on duty, buddy.
 I've brought a customer.

100
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,632
 I'm fed up.

101
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,633
 Will you do me a favour?
 If she comes & gives Rs.45, take it.

102
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,803
 My tank's full, I'll go to
 foreign & come back.

103
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,306
 Go first!

104
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,307
 First customer is a big
 headache case.

105
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,093
 Where's the Automan?

106
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,428
 You're that Rs.45 customer, isn't it?

107
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,831
 Give the money to me.

108
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,833
 I'm that automan's friend.

109
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,834
 Give it bravely.

110
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,172
 She's giving Rs.50 for Rs.45.

111
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,173
 He said headache customer!
 Looks like a rich one.

112
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,688
 Did she give the fare?-She gave.

113
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,189
 Give it to me.
 -Not this one.

114
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,190
 My day's first earning.

115
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,547
 Talk to me later.

116
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,583
 Can I make a phone call?

117
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,590
 ...Phone.

118
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,591
 Speak.

119
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,598
 Mother!

120
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,767
 Where are you calling from?
 -From a friend's house.

121
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,768
 Are you gossiping?
 -No..No, I'm in group studies.

122
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,106
 Don't come late saying
 you're in group studies.

123
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,775
 Okay, Mother! It'll be over
 in another 2 hours.

124
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,943
 Study properly.

125
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,944
 I'll study sincerely.

126
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,952
 I'm here.

127
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
 It's here 'C' Row.

128
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,589
 Door bell is ringing.
 Go & check, who's that?

129
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,003
 Malar...come here...come.

130
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,672
 Door bell is going on ringing
 for a long time.

131
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,673
 Do you want me to prepare notes for the
 seminar, or attend to this.

132
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,511
 I'm coming from inside.

133
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,512
 He's sleeping in the Hall, isn't it,
 without any reaction.

134
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,283
 Okay...I'll talk to him.

135
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,355
 What're you doing?

136
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,356
 It has been ringing since a long time.
 -Ringing?

137
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,359
 Who's that?

138
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
 Okay! May be the gas man
 ...you go and check.

139
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,311
 What happened to you?

140
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,050
 Mother, come with me.

141
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,885
 Come with me, I'll tell you.

142
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,053
 What's it?-Nothing.

143
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,055
 Why're you dragging me out like this?
 -An important matter.

144
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,390
 Wait...wait....-Mother....

145
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,227
 ..Please sit...sit here
 -Why did you bring me here?

146
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,395
 Nothing mother!

147
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,396
 Mother! Today's climate
 is very pleasant, isn't it?

148
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,734
 Mother, turn to my side.

149
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,903
 Great! you look beautiful
 today, mother.

150
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,904
 Father is also looking
 little smart today.

151
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,744
 What?

152
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,246
 ..Did you see any girl?

153
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,247
 Mother, how could you....

154
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,418
 If you find everything beautiful...

155
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,419
 Either you must've a poet's heart
 ...or you must be in love.

156
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,758
 I know very well that you don't
 have any poetical sense.

157
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,093
 ...Mother, what's this?

158
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,762
 Why're you hesitating with me?
 It's a girl, isn't it?

159
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,930
 Yes, mother!

160
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,598
 I've seen her thrice!

161
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,267
 Very beautiful girl.

162
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,768
 Mother, she's brilliant!

163
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,104
 She's very good girl mother,
 if you see her.

164
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,105
 ...You'll definitely say
 she's my daughter-in-law.

165
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,943
 Who's that girl?

166
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,945
 I don't, who is she, mother?

167
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,613
 Don't know?

168
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,614
 You just said, she's good girl
 as if you know her for years.

169
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,452
 Not just years, mother, I feel we know
 each other for many lifes.

170
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,290
 Look here, a Rs.50 note
 given by that girl.

171
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,460
 How carefully, I've kept it.

172
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,461
 Seeking my blessings, how many Rs.50 notes
 you would've taken from me.

173
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,301
 Did you ever keep carefully
 atleast one note?

174
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,136
 Mother, don't mind all this.

175
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,637
 Now, you don't know about that
 girl's where abouts, isn't it?

176
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,638
 Mother, I'll know, I'll
 find her out.

177
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,809
 First study & pass the exam
 as told by your father.

178
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,149
 After that you find her or chase,
 do whatever you want to.

179
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,150
 Mother, don't complain
 to that tall man.

180
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,826
 Sir, shall we go to Teynampet?

181
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,162
 You appear like going to Kannammapet.
 You want to go to Teynampet.

182
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,830
 My Auto will not ply
 Breeze will blow now.

183
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,998
 ...You will reach your
 destination automatically.

184
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,167
 Don't make fun of me
 If you want run the meter.

185
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,836
 I can't run the meter for dust.

186
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,338
 Passenger will come!
 You stick on to them.

187
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,339
 My son's are also coming.
 I must drop them at school.

188
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,343
 You're like a Pin,
 do you're son's also?

189
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,511
 As if great VGP sons & P.ORR sons.

190
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,513
 When I can take dust
 won't I take those rust also?

191
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,681
 Call them also!

192
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,682
 Hey...younger one....

193
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,523
 Is the younger one?

194
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,692
 Don't cast an evil eye on my child?
 There's another one.

195
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,693
 Hey...elder one...

196
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,530
 Coming father!

197
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,702
 You're sending wild Elephants
 to school with uniforms.

198
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,376
 Don't get into my auto,
 it's just a tin box.

199
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,877
 Listen to me boys!

200
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,878
 I can't load the things which should be
 loaded into a Cargo Ship.

201
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,215
 Leave me, brother!

202
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,218
 Hold this, I'll get in first
 -Dear children, get in -Be careful.

203
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,891
 Brother, come...

204
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,727
 Dear children carefully
 sit comfortably.

205
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,896
 Brother,..just move-If there's
 no space, I'll catch other Auto also.

206
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,897
 It'll get late.

207
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,900
 Hey, you're loading two tanker
 lorries into an auto.

208
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,238
 Child be careful -What a small auto
 you've engaged father?

209
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,741
 It's sinking in...even
 number plate is going in...

210
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,414
 He said 2 people, filled
 two villages into it.

211
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,418
 Brother come, Teacher will beat us.

212
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,419
 Please take us soon
 -You've unjustly buried my auto!

213
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,424
 Brother, will you ply your
 auto to Moolakadai?

214
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,758
 It'll go to Kayilankadai(junk seller).

215
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,759
 Will you ply to Medavakkam?

216
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,261
 I'm struggling in Pallavakkam(ditch).
 You want to go to Medavakkam.

217
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:03,928
 ...Get lost man!

218
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,596
 Brother, when will you start?

219
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,099
 He's asking as if I've to start
 a funeral procession.

220
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
 You've put on black veils, isn't it?

221
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,442
 Where's that 103?

222
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,443
 He's in the station, madam.

223
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,277
 Station?

224
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,945
 When he has work here
 what is he doing there?

225
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,946
 Ask him to come here immediately
 -I'll inform, madam.

226
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,960
 Hey, which coating is going on?
 -Second coating, madam.

227
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,474
 ..I'm living in the opposite flat.

228
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,144
 She's my wife, Malar.

229
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,283
 Are you moving into this flat?

230
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,452
 Why're you asking all
 this questions?

231
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,122
 Are you going to file an FIR?

232
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,123
 ...No, I'm this building's Secretary.

233
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,126
 ...If you need any help.

234
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,462
 Look, don't appear without summons.

235
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,465
 Will you come with a hungry
 look if it's a woman?

236
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,470
 What's my age? You're talking so...

237
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,805
 Get lost man.

238
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,640
 Has come to help me
 like a macho man...

239
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,476
 Why do you want to talk
 to manners less people?

240
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,511
 You come in!

241
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,512
 ..Come in.

242
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,586
 Apple Maiden! Who're you?

243
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,924
 Statue of Ice Cream! Who're you?

244
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,096
 Are you the mirage that
 appears & vanishes?

245
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,474
 Daughter of a flower! Who're you?

246
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,310
 Smiling moon! Who're you?

247
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,311
 Who're you, who vanishes half way
 through my dream like a bird.

248
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,484
 You didn't see me!

249
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,153
 ...It hurt my heart.

250
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:52,154
 Maiden, my life goes in
 the way you went.

251
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,493
 At some road turn, I lost
 your image.

252
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,831
 Dear, my life is at stand still
 there itself.

253
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,036
 I saw lightening & closed my eyes
 when I opened, it vanished.

254
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,375
 I'm not qualified to
 catch the lightening.

255
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,383
 I don't know where the rain drop
 has fallen that came for me.

256
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,722
 No information till now, in which mussel
 it fell & turned into a pearl.

257
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,227
 Oh! Beauty I'll not touch food &
 water, till I see you.

258
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,566
 Even if you go to the other side
 of the sky, I'll not leave you.

259
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,571
 Before, I see you, even if God appears...
 ..I'll not pray to him.

260
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,209
 Maiden! If I see you next time.

261
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,645
 Will you say, I Love you?

262
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,646
 Will you kill me with your
 eyes feeling pity on me?

263
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,654
 Even if you're at the brink of this world.
 I'll come there also.

264
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,991
 ...Do you know that?

265
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,992
 If I pluck my life & present
 it to you, will you accept?

266
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,331
 If you say yes, I'll live
 for hundred years.

267
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,670
 If you say No, I'll die
 at the end of the word.

268
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,675
 I'll come back again in another body
 & love you again.

269
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,273
 What's it?-Asking me, what's it?

270
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,274
 Why did you defile my wall
 with cow dung?

271
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:40,945
 Did I do it?

272
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,447
 Then what? Why're you acting
 as if you're innocent?

273
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,616
 What proof do you're that
 it was done by us only?

274
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,617
 Hey...in this complex other than your wife
 no one keeps cow dung on designs.

275
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,456
 Have you come in support
 of your wife?

276
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,460
 Talk respectfully!

277
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,128
 Why should I respect you, man?
 -Take off your hand.

278
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,631
 Take off your hands
 -Should I respect you?

279
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,467
 Hello, is this police station
 or what?

280
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,803
 I'm asking you, isn't it? What's this
 trouble here?-Come, Mr.Vadivelu!

281
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,638
 Hey...are you coming in
 support of him?

282
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,474
 Mind your own business.
 Why're you staring at me? Go..go..

283
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,475
 Look, if anyone gives me trouble.
 I'll finish you.

284
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,647
 Aunty! What're you looking at?
 Clear out.

285
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,816
 Are you all trying to put pressurize
 me, coming together -Look!

286
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,817
 Just because you're wearing uniform...
 -Otherwise, what will you do?

287
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,320
 Hey, are you both husband & wife trying
 to be smart with me?

288
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,657
 You know, who am I, isn't it?

289
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,993
 I'll hand cuffs you both &
 take you in a jeep.

290
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,829
 Oh God, okay, now tell me
 what you want us to do?

291
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,664
 That's it.

292
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,832
 Hey, llango!

293
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,668
 Down there, that policewoman is fighting
 unnecessarily with your mother.

294
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,669
 What're you doing here?

295
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,186
 Mother..mother...mother.

296
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,522
 Mother, what's all this?
 First throw this, mother.

297
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,025
 Who asked you to do all this?
 That Policewoman?

298
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,359
 Watch out, what I'll do to her?

299
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 Hey...where's she?

300
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,199
 Sit!

301
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,036
 How proud you're to misbehave
 with my mother?

302
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,038
 Watch out, what I'm going do?

303
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,205
 You created trouble infront
 of my house!

304
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,207
 I've created trouble in your house
 what can you do?

305
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,876
 Do whatever you can do?

306
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,377
 Are you thinking yourself
 to be great?-Listen to me..

307
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,211
 With whom you've brushed
 on the wrong side?

308
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,212
 Mother please! Today, I'll finish her
 -Please take him out.

309
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,883
 Don't unnecessarily invite trouble.
 Let this be the last, that's it?

310
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,063
 Sir, are you going to buy the auto?

311
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,898
 No! can you rent it for 1 hour?

312
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,900
 It'll come, all 24 hours like Poly clinic.
 Where do you want to go?

313
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,069
 No need to go anywhere
 It's enough if you stay here only.

314
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,070
 Here only! But, I'll switch on the meter
 -Switch it on.

315
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,240
 Okay, will those side screens work?

316
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,576
 If I take it out, it'll cover fully
 -Oh, I too need that only.

317
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,412
 Why're you asking that?
 -A passenger will stay in with me.

318
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,915
 Passenger will stay?
 Who's that passenger?

319
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,751
 Just a minute!

320
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,253
 What're you both going
 to do inside?

321
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,923
 Nothing! If we go to lodge,
 Police will trouble us.

322
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,590
 For that?

323
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,925
 If we go to luxury guest houses...

324
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,426
 ...Police are swooping on us with
 the help of Internet.

325
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,260
 For that?

326
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,261
 For that, as cheap & best
 here inside.

327
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,598
 Is my auto a lodge for
 you to make love?

328
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,938
 Sir, I can understand your feelings.

329
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,773
 But that place will be
 little larger than this.

330
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,609
 There'll be phone & fan also and it'll
 have an affect of double bed also.

331
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,944
 Is it okay for you?

332
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,278
 ...Show me that place.

333
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,279
 I'll show!

334
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
 Oh! Bed..screen...

335
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,617
 Oh....Fan....Oh! Phone.

336
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,789
 ...Oh! Jasmine flowers!

337
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,790
 Sir, as said by you, it has all comforts
 what vehicle is this?

338
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,294
 Why're you bothered about it?

339
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,295
 It's too sultry! If I've a AC
 it'll be good.

340
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,299
 AC? Look there!

341
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:56,140
 Hey! I told we'll go to a guest house,
 you didn't heed me.

342
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,308
 It's a jeep! so I thought
 it'll be cheap.

343
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,309
 You've made me to board a Police jeep
 -Don't beat me.

344
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,982
 Officer, you've mistaken habitually,
 look inside.

345
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,654
 Everyone is waste.

346
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,991
 Hey, have you taken your
 hall ticket?-I've.

347
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,829
 What's this Sriram?

348
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,830
 He's going to write the exam,
 where're you going with suitcase?

349
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,501
 Mother, I'm going to Delhi
 regarding a job.

350
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,670
 If I pass, I'll get a job
 in Foreign.

351
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,505
 Bless me.

352
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,506
 Pass & try to join the job
 at the earliest.

353
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,178
 You fell at my feet, wait a minute.

354
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,179
 Where is she going?
 - You're going to see, isn't it?

355
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,018
 Take this.
 -What's all this, mother?

356
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,687
 Hey...whoever falls at my mother's feet
 he'll definitely get money.

357
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,522
 She'll bless only after
 giving money.

358
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,357
 MGR's last heir.

359
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,359
 Take it -Keep it.

360
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,361
 Mother, I'm also going
 to write exam.

361
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,362
 Bless me for atleast for
 a King Fisher.

362
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,366
 I know very well that you'll
 fall at my feet.

363
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,035
 Take it. -Thanks mother!

364
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,036
 Your father has gone to temple for
 special prayers for your success.

365
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,875
 Breakfast is ready,
 both of you've it & go.

366
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,878
 You stay back, have breakfast & go
 I'll go...

367
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,315
 llango..wait..wait...

368
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,385
 Take God's offerings.

369
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,390
 Why're you going on a bike today?

370
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,391
 If you go in auto you can study
 while travelling, isn't it?

371
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,073
 Oh! My girl!

372
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,407
 What Selvi? My Husband.

373
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,408
 Are you minting money today?
 -No, not much!

374
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,412
 Just now got a lone passenger.

375
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,082
 Where's the passenger going?
 -To Adyar!

376
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,083
 Traffic Police are checking
 that side.

377
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,355
 Go carefully. It's month end
 they may book you.

378
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,090
 I must go to RTO office on
 an urgent work.

379
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,091
 While coming, pick up children
 from the school, okay?

380
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,761
 Don't say RTO office and get drunk,
 come home early.

381
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,098
 You're pulling my legs again, even if
 I get drunk, I'm steady.

382
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,103
 Passenger is there, drive carefully.

383
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,606
 Shall I go?

384
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,210
 ...Follow that vehicle fast..fast..

385
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,779
 Driver of that auto is my wife.

386
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,448
 Driver may be your wife but
 the passenger is my girl.

387
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,449
 Follow it fast! Ride fast man
 Signal's down.

388
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,453
 I can't go any more fast
 in this traffic.

389
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,292
 I've missed her because of
 you only. Go fast man.

390
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,127
 Not this auto man, go fast man.

391
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,296
 Can't I recognise my wife's auto?

392
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,298
 My luck, I got into
 your Auto today.

393
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,134
 If you say anything about my auto
 I'll throw you out.

394
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,469
 Then, you've to run after
 and catch her.

395
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,804
 You may miss that auto.

396
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,139
 That auto is going below
 the over bridge.

397
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,641
 Do you know where'll the road
 below the bridge lead to?

398
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:45,809
 Overtake the bus & go man.

399
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,810
 There's no auto in front of the bus.
 That auto's gone.

400
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,080
 l've missed.

401
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,150
 Go right!

402
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,151
 Hey! Where're you going? I said right
 & you're going the left.

403
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,656
 Why do you ply autos?

404
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,657
 Watch front & drive,
 Why're you watching my face?

405
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,429
 Why did you stop the auto?

406
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,332
 l can't go any further
 take another auto.

407
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,334
 What's this man?
 You've stopped mid way.

408
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,335
 Hey, why did you stop
 before my house?

409
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,005
 Take the vehicle, my father may see me.
 ..He may see me.

410
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,510
 What're you doing here?

411
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,979
 What're you doing here in Auto?

412
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,180
 Didn't you go to write the exam?

413
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,181
 No, father, I'm going,
 take out the vehicle.

414
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,184
 Already you're late by 30 minutes,
 how can you write exam now?

415
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:33,023
 Sir, is this brother your son?

416
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,858
 He'll never come good.

417
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,859
 He pestered me to chase a
 girl in auto.

418
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,697
 ..He made the tyres of my
 auto to wear out.

419
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,866
 Oh! ls he writing exam today?

420
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,535
 Result is out now itself.

421
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,536
 Okay, give me Rs.98.

422
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,208
 In future you're going
 to ply auto only.

423
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,877
 You're my son, isn't it?
 What did I deny you?

424
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,046
 I don't mind, if you don't bring
 laurels to me.

425
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,715
 It's enough if you don't
 spoil my fair name.

426
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,716
 I'm the one who wishes even the last
 bench boy to pass in 1st division.

427
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,054
 My son, you've missed writing
 your exam. Chasing a girl.

428
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,557
 Are you a skirt chaser?

429
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,229
 What do you want to become in life?

430
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,397
 If you miss to study at this age.

431
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,399
 ..You'll find yourself on
 streets in future.

432
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,567
 If you had written the exam &
 then failed, it is acceptable.

433
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,903
 But you've missed writing
 exam itself.

434
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,905
 ..That too for a girl.

435
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,574
 What's this, I'm going on saying
 you're standing unmoved?

436
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,411
 ...Dear...everyone's
 watching, isn't it?

437
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,912
 Why're you scolding him?

438
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,081
 Let all of them watch it atleast then,
 he'll become sensitive.

439
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,250
 Let it be anything, let's go home
 & discuss it.

440
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,418
 What did you do?

441
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,419
 Mother, this man's talking too much.
 -Will you keep quiet?

442
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,090
 Why didn't you attend the exam?

443
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,426
 ...Dear, you come in.

444
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,761
 It seems you asked Sriram
 to meet someone in Delhi.

445
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,097
 He told you to keep the visiting card
 ready. He said he'll call you.

446
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,765
 He's a good boy.

447
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,201
 He too studied with him
 only, isn't it?

448
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,202
 You'll not get sense even if
 you drink his urine.

449
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,286
 Mother is calling you, isn't it?

450
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,963
 What's this? Where're you gong?
 -Enough mother!

451
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,631
 How he had insulted me infront of
 so many people?

452
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,966
 How cheaply he talked about me?

453
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,967
 How can I live in these flats now?
 ...I'm going away, mother!

454
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,473
 ...Please listen to me!

455
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,975
 Who scolded you?
 Your father only, isn't it?

456
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,477
 As soon as you asked he brought
 you a bike, isn't it?

457
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,479
 Even then, I can't stay a minute
 more with him.

458
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,480
 He only isn't sensitive,
 even I'm also sensitive.

459
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,251
 Yuck! This zip.

460
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,154
 ...Please listen to me.

461
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,155
 Look, even Zip is stopping you
 from going out.

462
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,626
 ...Sorry mother, I'm not going to change
 my decision at any cost.

463
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,627
 Please, bless me, mother.

464
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,932
 Why're you falling at my feet
 at this time?

465
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,335
 You had taken money from me
 morning only, isn't it?

466
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,336
 Wait a minute!

467
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,361
 Sub-Inspector Nirmala's flat?

468
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,362
 ..She has moved in newly!

469
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,208
 Why're you talking to him?
 Come inside.

470
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,217
 Take it son, keep this money.

471
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,055
 Aren't you able to go?

472
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,326
 ...Aren't you able to
 leave me & go away?

473
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,731
 How can you go?

474
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,732
 I've showered affection on you
 for 21 years & brought you up.

475
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,069
 Won't you've that affection on me?

476
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,407
 Come in, no need to go out
 you come in.

477
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,743
 Thank you God!

478
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,931
 On Chennai's Anna Road
 I've seen an 8 coloured rainbow.

479
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,773
 I leaped into the sky
 to catch hold of it.

480
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,777
 ...I sweated as it dissolved in rain.

481
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,782
 The time I spent in searching
 the rainbow.

482
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,957
 The rainbow I went in search
 has come searching me.

483
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,198
 Learning the technics
 for 1000's of years.

484
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,703
 ..God has created a shattering beauty.

485
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,873
 Eyes are 3% of the body.

486
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,211
 If I see the rest of it
 I may die.

487
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,554
 Each girl will have a
 thing beautiful.

488
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,891
 But, the girl I've seen
 everything is beautiful.

489
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,396
 The sky that has moon
 only the face is bright.

490
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,734
 But the girl! I've seen even
 her shadow is bright.

491
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,238
 There are no nights to the street
 in which she lives...no..!

492
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,743
 Let her see me! I'll become eternal.

493
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,467
 Plucking out 2 stars from the sky.

494
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,971
 Wiping it with a flower slowly.

495
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,646
 ...He has created her eyes.

496
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,647
 Did he chop his heart with her eyes?

497
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,823
 If she says yes, I'll reside
 in her heart.

498
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,160
 If she says no,
 I'll loiter there only.

499
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,665
 There're two heavens
 one in a maiden's heart.

500
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,169
 Another under her feet.

501
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,674
 There's no maiden like her, no!

502
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,011
 ..And God has no idea of creating
 another one like her.

503
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,075
 ..Here only, from a friend's place.

504
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,745
 ...No.....No!

505
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,746
 I'm in a group study. -Don't delay
 by saying group study.

506
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,424
 Where have you lost in
 thoughts & driving?

507
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,259
 ...The thoughts in which
 you've lost yourself.

508
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,260
 ...Even I'm also lost in that
 thought's only & driving.

509
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,933
 Don't stare at me! Get lost.

510
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,934
 Get lost man!

511
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,321
 Do you've a match box?-Why?

512
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,322
 I've a strange feeling in my mouth.

513
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,392
 I thought, I'll smoke a cigarette.

514
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,393
 Cigarette?

515
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,898
 You've moved into my
 opposite flat, isn't it?

516
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,899
 Yes, Sub-Inspector Nirmala
 is my mother.

517
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,403
 Okay, how did you get my name
 when you came inquiring address?

518
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,242
 That, It's all Astrology.

519
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,744
 ...Astrology? -It's Astrology.

520
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,346
 Don't cook all that stories with me.

521
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,347
 Oh God! Your lines are predicting
 fantastic future.

522
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,417
 There're many chances of becoming
 a big man in business.

523
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,754
 Education is line very bad!

524
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,091
 You've come spending 2 years
 in each class.

525
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,761
 It says you're smoking a pack
 of cigarettes everyday.

526
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,265
 Watch out!

527
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,934
 There're lot of chances of getting
 afflicted by cancer next week.

528
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,935
 Oh! My mother!

529
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,615
 I shiver, when I see my mother
 even you too!

530
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,454
 Is your mother also a devil
 like my mother?

531
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,791
 My mother isn't like that,
 I & my mother are like close friends.

532
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,963
 We share everything.

533
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,299
 I'll never hide anything
 from my mother.

534
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,300
 But, before your arrival
 your mother & we had a tiff.

535
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,904
 So, mother doesn't like me talking
 to anyone in your house.

536
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,008
 So, I came running here not
 to hurt her feelings.

537
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,149
 Did my mother start the trouble?

538
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,150
 Yes...

539
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,653
 ...Why're you feeling for this?

540
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:11,988
 My mother could've done the
 mistake, isn't it?

541
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,324
 Oh God, definitely my mother only
 would've committed the mistake.

542
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,160
 No, definitely it would be
 my mother only.

543
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,662
 She wouldn't have picked up
 a fight with your family only.

544
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,663
 C Block Flat No.7 &
 A Block Flat No.4.

545
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
 She would've picked up a
 fight with them also. -Why?

546
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,504
 Because there're young men
 in those homes.

547
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,677
 Whenever we shift house.

548
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,013
 My mother only will come
 first to reside.

549
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,014
 Only after picking up fight's
 with parents of boys.

550
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,353
 ...She'll bring me here.

551
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,354
 Till then, I'll stay in my
 uncle's house.

552
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:50,524
 My mother expected a luxurious life
 but she got a different one.

553
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,862
 So the luxurious life which she
 missed with her marriage.

554
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:58,299
 ...She wants to achieve it
 with my marriage.

555
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,704
 She's from the old gengeration,
 we can't follow her.

556
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,876
 At the same time can't
 go against also.

557
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,711
 We're younger generation.

558
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,712
 Atleast we'll maintain friendship
 without their knowledge. Okay?

559
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,717
 ...I'll go down.

560
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,554
 ...One more thing.

561
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,555
 Don't smoke like this out side
 they'll arrest you.

562
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,130
 Brother, please save us!

563
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,798
 What's this you're coming
 with garlands?

564
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,632
 Didn't you get any marriage hall?

565
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,634
 No, brother we both belong
 to different castes.

566
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,969
 We both belong to
 different Religions.

567
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,138
 The whole town is against our love.

568
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,806
 You both are major, isn't it?
 -Yes, brother.

569
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,808
 Then, you both get married
 -Impossible.

570
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,475
 Why not?

571
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,476
 Eloping & marrying, isn't
 considered as marriage -Then?

572
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,479
 A marriage is one that's performed
 before 4 respectable people.

573
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,649
 All you want is respected
 people, isn't it?-Yes.

574
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,655
 Did you see!

575
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,158
 Kamaraj, one who opened the
 eyes of education for us.

576
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,493
 Father of Indian Constitution, Ambedkar.

577
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,996
 Poor people's God
 Revolutionary Leader MGR.

578
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,998
 They're respectable
 people, isn't it?-Yes.

579
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,332
 What? - Yes!

580
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,333
 Now, under their auspices,this marriage
 will be conducted. Is it okay?

581
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,173
 Tie the auspicious thread
 beat the drums man.

582
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,174
 You blow the pipe...blow
 ...blow...you tie it man?

583
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,313
 Go home. -Thank you very
 much brother.

584
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,681
 Let it be, how's that?

585
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,016
 Excellent Judgement!

586
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,685
 I've few more respectable
 people's photo inside.

587
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,686
 Brother, get us also married.
 -Is that my profession?

588
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,623
 Not possible..Get lost man.

589
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,359
 Brother, don't refuse like that.
 Brother, conduct their marriage also.

590
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,360
 Conduct it...conduct it.

591
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,198
 Are you major?-Yes.

592
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,032
 Is he major?

593
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,534
 No, he's our Town's Minor(Land lord).
 -Who's this foolish lady?

594
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,869
 You both agree to marry, isn't it?

595
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,871
 I'll manage if anyone
 raises objections.

596
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,207
 Come on, take out the auspicious thread.
 Beat the drums.

597
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,208
 Play the wind pipe!
 Play...play...tie the knot.

598
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,814
 Brother, these are people who're
 against our love.

599
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,883
 Hey, who got them married?

600
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,718
 Brother, this brother had
 only conducted it.

601
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,554
 That's...that's...-Why're you hesitating?
 Tell them bravely.

602
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,222
 Yes.

603
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,390
 Bloody! You've ruined my life.

604
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,391
 What're you blabbering?

605
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,228
 What's the connection between your life
 getting ruined & this marriage?

606
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,730
 Bloody fool! She's my wife.

607
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,731
 Wife? Then, who's he?
 -He's my husband.

608
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,235
 Hey! you've got a woman married
 to her paramour, unjustly.

609
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,073
 Stop! Stop it.

610
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,208
 For the sin, which I've committed.

611
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,077
 I'll repent for it myself.

612
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:24,078
 What're you going to do?

613
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,753
 I'll get these two married.

614
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,727
 Oh! God! - Sorry.

615
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,296
 It's my leg that's broken.

616
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,798
 Where are you looking &
 saying sorry?

617
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,799
 You? Here?
 -Oh! Are you also here only?

618
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,136
 I came here just to meet.
 -Who?

619
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,139
 Miss.Rose?
 -Who?

620
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:26,309
 Why did you pluck it?

621
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,310
 I thought, it'll match your dress.

622
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,314
 More than adorning it my hair.
 I admire roses in the plant itself.

623
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,153
 Oh! Me too!
 I too like to grow rose plants.

624
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,158
 Yes, Am I lying?

625
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,159
 Okay, which colour rose are
 you taking home?

626
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,829
 If I take it to home,if my mother sees it,
 next moment, she'll ask.

627
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,835
 To trap which boy you're
 growing a rose plant?

628
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,177
 Your mother is better! Do you know
 what my father will say?

629
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,178
 Without developing brain
 why're you growing silly things?

630
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,851
 One thing is definite.
 Our tastes are same.

631
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,854
 If you join me, together
 not just a rose.

632
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,025
 We can grow a cluster of roses.
 -How's that?

633
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,195
 I was about to say, we can pool in money
 & start a bigger nursery.

634
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,200
 Are you going to start a business?

635
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,201
 Whether it's large or small
 first pay money for broken pot.

636
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,206
 Take it out, quickly.

637
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,547
 Why auto? You're going home, isn't it?

638
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,548
 To home only, but I've not
 come on bike.

639
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,387
 We can go on my bike, isn't it.

640
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:47,388
 Why do you want to take trouble?

641
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,891
 I'll get my vehicle.

642
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,595
 We've reached near our home.
 If we go further together.

643
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,266
 I'll get caught with my mother &
 you with your parents.

644
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,270
 We'll meet again later.

645
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,062
 Please sir...My bike.

646
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,063
 Go & meet Sergeant.

647
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,067
 Sir, I had parked it unknowingly.

648
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,569
 What's your name?

649
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,403
 Tell me your address.

650
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:10,404
 Sir, I really didn't knew it
 was a no-parking zone.

651
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,242
 Everyone who's caught is
 repeating the same line.

652
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,243
 Pay fine once! Govt. Treasury
 is also empty.

653
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,413
 Sir, please pardon me, this time.

654
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,917
 Come man!

655
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,252
 No RC book!

656
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,088
 Come here!

657
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,423
 How much you've in pocket?
 Take it out.

658
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,091
 I'll talk to him.

659
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,427
 I don't have any money!
 I had filled petrol morning only.

660
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,429
 Don't waste time boy!

661
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,264
 You know how much it'll be if you
 pay fine in court.

662
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,265
 Sir, I don't have! If you want
 check it yourself.

663
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,606
 What's this silly 5's and 10's?

664
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,442
 Oh! Here's a 50!

665
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,277
 You're keeping bigger notes
 hidden inside.

666
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,612
 I'll manage sir...
 You may go.

667
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,447
 No, I can't give this note.

668
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,782
 Leave my hand!

669
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,450
 You know how much fine you
 may've to pay.

670
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,785
 You may've to roam for the
 case in courts.

671
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,453
 Go away.

672
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,788
 Please listen to me. No...No...
 I can't give you that note.

673
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,790
 Move away...Troubling me.

674
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,791
 I want that note!
 I'll not give it to you.

675
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,639
 I told you earlier itself that
 I'll not give it to you.

676
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,974
 Why did you crumple & throw it?

677
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,975
 Leave me!

678
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,170
 The mistake is his. Why did he park
 in a no-parking area?

679
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,509
 A Policeman will ask money...

680
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,510
 He had money in his pocket, isn't it?
 He should've given it.

681
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,516
 He has made me to go to a
 Police Station.

682
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,352
 Dear, will you be quiet
 for a moment?

683
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,353
 He has become useless because of your
 pampering him like this.

684
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,861
 My son, it seems you had
 money with you.

685
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,198
 You could've given it to
 the Policeman, isn't it?

686
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,199
 Why're you talking like father
 knowing everything?

687
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,369
 The 50 rupee note in my purse
 was given by that girl.

688
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,207
 Not that, you've come hurt like this
 after fighting with Police.

689
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,212
 You could've given that
 note, isn't it?

690
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,884
 Mother, did you scold me?

691
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,886
 Mother, did you ever scold me?

692
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:37,720
 No.

693
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,721
 No! When I was studying in 7th standard
 for a school drama...

694
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,894
 When I took your saree without your
 knowledge, and brought it back torn.

695
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,395
 You've burnt me.

696
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:48,397
 If you want, see this!

697
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,398
 That night, you hugged and
 told me in cries...

698
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,401
 That it isn't just a saree, but
 a first gift from my father.

699
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,239
 You said, you'll keep it
 safely till end.

700
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,242
 How a father's gift is important you
 just like that.

701
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,248
 The 50 rupee note given by that girl
 is very important.

702
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,921
 That girl is very lucky.

703
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,427
 Where's that girl?

704
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,428
 I'll show her...I'll show her
 in near future.

705
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,903
 Buds....buds...silent buds...

706
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,075
 My dear is sleeping!
 Bloom in the morning.

707
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,746
 When the golden buds bloom...
 There's a little noise.

708
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,918
 If my Lover's sleep is disturbed
 my heart can't bear it.

709
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,091
 Buds...buds...silent buds!

710
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,429
 My lover is sleeping,
 bloom in the morning.

711
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,273
 If my lover's sleep in disturbed,
 my heart can't bear it.

712
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,188
 If you give a flower...
 I'll adorn it on my heart.

713
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,593
 I'm saving the withered flowers
 in a Bank Locker.

714
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,366
 I'll come & enter your
 garden at night.

715
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,538
 I'll leave the roses &
 steal away the thorns.

716
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:49,209
 If you tell yes, I'll bloom as
 a flower on your shirt.

717
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,418
 I'll save even the breath
 let out by my lover.

718
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,756
 I'll call even the left out tea by
 my lover as Holy water.

719
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,262
 I'll write our names on
 the sea shore.

720
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,767
 I'll try to kill the sea which
 tries to erase our names.

721
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,439
 When I saw sweat of your forehead...
 I tried to cut the sunlight.

722
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,396
 ...Come in.

723
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:24,733
 How come you're here?

724
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:25,901
 You know me?

725
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,902
 What's this? Your father C.K. is
 a big businessman.

726
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,907
 Sir, any problem in your area?

727
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,579
 Problem is my area only.

728
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,581
 Not outside...but inside!

729
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,582
 We can discuss it outside.

730
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:55,597
 What are you looking at?

731
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,598
 This is our car only.
 Get in.

732
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,274
 Actually I had come to meet you
 regarding my marriage.

733
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,610
 I saw your daughter.

734
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:12,781
 ....I'm Sriram speaking.

735
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,283
 When did you come back from Delhi?

736
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,285
 Buddy, I've some important
 news for you.

737
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,286
 Otherwise, my head will go bonkers.

738
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,287
 In 10 minutes, I'll meet you
 personally & tell you.

739
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,962
 Where are you?

740
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,800
 Mother, why're you
 sitting dejectedly?

741
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,636
 Nothing.

742
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,471
 What happened to you all?

743
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:39,472
 Brother will tell you! He's in backyard,
 go & meet him.

744
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,313
 What happened?

745
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,648
 Won't you tell me also?

746
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,649
 I don't know how I'm going to get
 all of them married.

747
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,653
 Tell me, what's the matter?
 Did you fail in Delhi interview?

748
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,325
 No...No, I've passed the training.

749
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,327
 Visa to Libya is also ready.

750
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:01,328
 But, they're asking me to pay
 Rs.2.5 lakhs for work permit.

751
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,664
 If I go to Libya, I'll get all
 my sisters married in 2 years.

752
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,671
 Why're you all like mourning
 death for this?

753
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,672
 Now, if you've Rs.2.5 lakhs you can go
 to Libya, that's all, isn't it?

754
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,677
 I'm there boy!

755
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,678
 I'll arrange it.

756
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,351
 If you hadn't helped
 my son financially.

757
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,853
 My son wouldn't have got this
 foreign job.

758
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:25,687
 Thank you very much.

759
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,357
 Oh! This isn't such a big thing.

760
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,358
 Seek their blessings, son.

761
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,029
 Give money!

762
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,698
 Keep this!
 -Thanks mother.

763
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:37,699
 When is the flight scheduled?

764
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,368
 Still there's time.

765
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,370
 llango, come with me.

766
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,371
 Sorry buddy, I forgot about
 in my busy schedule.

767
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,042
 You had called me that day & said
 you'll say some important news.

768
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,043
 What's this?

769
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,044
 Leave that! I'll write to
 you about it.

770
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,714
 Come on tell me.

771
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,715
 Why do you want it to know now?

772
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,718
 Hey! Look there.

773
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,922
 Do you know, who's that girl?

774
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,725
 Names' Mano! She lives in the flat
 opposite your flat.

775
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,560
 She would've told your
 Bio-Data correctly.

776
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,561
 Yes!How do you know that?

777
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,400
 How do I know it?

778
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,401
 We are lovers.

779
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,678
 It's a mistake to hide it from you.

780
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,514
 Born as the eldest son
 in a fatherless family.

781
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,515
 With marriageable aged sisters
 with bleak future.

782
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,185
 I felt very cheap to reveal even to
 close friend about my love.

783
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,192
 I had only told Mano also not to tell
 anyone about our love.

784
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,036
 She has come to give me send off.

785
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,037
 She's standing alone, so that
 no one comes to know about her.

786
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,215
 You know very well about
 her mother.

787
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,216
 If she comes to know about our Love.
 She may harm Mano.

788
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,554
 As far my house is concerned,
 they're very orthodox family.

789
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,892
 So, till my sisters get married...

790
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,228
 That I'm in love with a girl
 from other caste...

791
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,897
 Neither my family nor my relatives
 must come to know it.

792
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,898
 If they came to know, my sister's
 marriages will be affected.

793
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,569
 Moreover your parents have
 loaned me a large amount.

794
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,905
 So, for time being they also
 shouldn't know about it.

795
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,413
 Okay, it's time.

796
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,248
 One small help.

797
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,250
 If you go & stand with her.

798
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,251
 I'll bid her bye as if I'm
 saying it to you.

799
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:41,757
 Thanks buddy.

800
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,758
 I'll inform mother & come.

801
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,932
 I'll go!

802
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,660
 Did that girl deceive you?

803
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,672
 Tell me, did that girl betray you?

804
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,847
 No, mother.

805
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,848
 ...That girl is going to
 marry another boy.

806
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,856
 Just because you didn't get her.

807
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,857
 You threw a thing which you
 kept it for her memory.

808
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,530
 That day when you came
 hurt after fighting Police.

809
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,531
 Though I regretted as a mother.

810
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,701
 As a woman I did
 feel little happy.

811
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,037
 I was happy at how much my son has
 respect for a girl.

812
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,209
 But, now I've understood
 that it's a lie.

813
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,713
 No, mother.

814
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,714
 When you love, if I marry her,
 she'll live happily.

815
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,552
 Love with these thoughts
 only that's what you call as Love.

816
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,553
 Loving with a thought,
 I'll be happy is selfishness.

817
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,225
 What you had in your heart
 is selfishness.

818
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,063
 No, mother.

819
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,064
 Though that 50 rupee note
 was given by her.

820
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,401
 It's a symbol of respect you
 had on her.

821
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,073
 If you had really loved her..

822
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,076
 You would've never dared to
 tear that note.

823
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,419
 When I saw the torn note
 I couldn't bear it myself.

824
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,757
 That's why, I've pasted it.

825
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,095
 Show this note to your
 future wife.

826
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,432
 You tell her about your love.

827
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,603
 No women will mistake you.

828
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,782
 Mother, I'll sleep on your
 lap for sometime.

829
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,799
 Oh! God! The vehicle has come from
 F.C. just now.

830
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,468
 Lord Muruga, bless me with
 a good passenger.

831
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,971
 Brother!
 -Come, lightening!'

832
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,138
 ...What's this, it has only 3 wheels
 one wheel's short?

833
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,139
 This is not a car, mad fellow.
 This is newly F.C. Auto.

834
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,143
 F.C? Why I'm getting
 confused with F.C.?

835
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,646
 F.C. is not confusing you,The M.C. which
 you drank yesterday is confusing you.

836
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,647
 Yes, it's duplicate! It's troubling me.
 I want to go to Hospital.

837
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,484
 Will you ply? - No.

838
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:30,986
 Why?

839
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,655
 I ply free only for pregnant woman.
 ...Not for you.

840
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,656
 A citizen! You've insulted a citizen.
 -Citizen? You?

841
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,660
 I'm in City, So I'm Citizen.

842
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,328
 If they wear a Jetti(underwear),
 Is he a Jetti son?

843
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,329
 I don't have the habit of
 wearing all that.

844
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,330
 Yuck, nasty fellow!

845
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,743
 Letter from Sriram, isn't it?

846
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,744
 Is there a letter for me inside?

847
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,089
 Not now! Mother's inside.

848
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:14,594
 ...Near the Dish Antenna.

849
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,932
 Their parents are on warpath.
 Did you see their love?

850
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,269
 Take it.

851
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,439
 One minute.

852
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,462
 What's it?
 -T.V. reception is not clear.

853
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:50,463
 There's some problem with antenna.
 I'll go & check.

854
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,993
 Have you repaired the antenna?

855
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,994
 We both must join together
 and get it repaired.

856
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,512
 My mother will some how find
 out this letter.

857
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,516
 Keep this with you only.

858
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,520
 I'll take it later.

859
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,357
 Hey....Be careful with the letter.

860
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,367
 I know very well about my son.

861
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:00,869
 One who insulted us.

862
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,870
 He'll never have any connection with
 that Police woman's family.

863
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,039
 I'm telling you, isn't it?

864
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,876
 I've seen both talking together
 on the terrace.

865
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,877
 No, he'll not hide anything
 from me.

866
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,547
 Just now, he has got out
 from a big problem.

867
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,887
 Come here!

868
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,897
 What's the relationship
 between you & that girl?

869
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,566
 I'm asking you, isn't it?

870
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,568
 There's no relationship, mother.

871
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,237
 I believe you.

872
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,573
 I'm asking you for other's sake.

873
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,574
 Are you in love with that girl?

874
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:46,078
 No, mother.

875
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:52,418
 Promise on me!
 -I promise on you.

876
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,588
 Promise....

877
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,760
 Okay! go to bed.

878
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,270
 Enough! He's my son!

879
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,619
 I'm Mano speaking.
 Can you hear me?

880
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,787
 Tell me!

881
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,456
 I'm now speaking from Anna Nagar.

882
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:31,457
 Mother saw us on terrace &
 brought me here by night.

883
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,964
 Suspecting that you & me
 are in love.

884
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,969
 She's torturing me.

885
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,471
 I'm unable to bear it.

886
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,472
 Did you tell about you & Sriram?

887
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,977
 llango, How can I tell?

888
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,978
 The moment I tell her, next minute
 she'll go to Sriram's house and...

889
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,317
 ....I know what she'll do!

890
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,486
 There's no one to help me.

891
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,487
 It seems some richman C.K.
 has met me some where.

892
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,324
 My mother has arranged my
 marriage with him.

893
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,995
 I'm scared.

894
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,831
 I tried to contact Sriram
 in Libya on phone.

895
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,499
 But, couldn't get him on line.

896
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,334
 Now, I'm confused.

897
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,335
 I feel like dying!
 Please llango, help me out from this.

898
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,678
 Who's in the line at this hour?

899
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,517
 Mother, this is wrong number.

900
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:35,021
 Why're you talking to a wrong number?
 Go to sleep.

901
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,781
 Hey, why did you come here?

902
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,692
 Catch him.

903
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,743
 Come...come...come fast.

904
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,084
 Fast...fast...

905
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,327
 Hey, they'll definitely go & marry.

906
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,996
 Ask our men to be in
 all Registrar's Offices.

907
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:02,830
 Inform Police.

908
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,832
 I want her. Go man...go...

909
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,834
 We've tightened the security
 all over the city.

910
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,835
 They can't escape anywhere
 we'll definitely find them today itself.

911
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,650
 God, he must get the line...

912
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,988
 It's ringing.

913
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:29,323
 I'm llango speaking.

914
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,826
 Mano's mother tried to force her
 to get her married.

915
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,327
 I took her away from marriage
 in the last minute.

916
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,329
 Don't be afraid, she is safe.

917
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,330
 I've admitted her in
 a ladies hostel.

918
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,336
 Why're you silent?

919
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:45,006
 When Mano called me in the
 night & cried on phone.

920
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,508
 Even, I gave a thought about it.

921
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,677
 I did this, since I had
 no other choice.

922
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,679
 Have I done anything wrong?
 -Nothing.

923
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,015
 Casually, when I phoned to
 your house now...

924
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,016
 I came to know that your parents
 have been taken to police station.

925
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,520
 For me, how love is important similarly,
 your parents are important to you.

926
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,693
 What happened?

927
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,672
 Okay.

928
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,377
 What should we do now?

929
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,379
 First, you go to hostel.
 -No, I can't...

930
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,381
 You're facing, these problems
 because of me, isn't it?

931
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:30,382
 I'm asking you go, isn't it?

932
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,722
 If we get caught to my mother
 we're finished.

933
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,401
 Sir....my son has come.

934
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,074
 My son won't commit any mistakes.

935
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,075
 Even that girl has come with him.

936
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:06,085
 Come...come...-Leave me mother....

937
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,588
 ...Kidnapped her?

938
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,091
 You know that he is a V.I.P...

939
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:13,092
 You went to his marriage &
 kidnapped the bride.

940
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,428
 How did you....

941
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,429
 Don't hit him...

942
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,934
 Don't beat him...

943
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,105
 Don't dare to touch my mother.

944
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,773
 Don't beat him.

945
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:27,775
 ..Ask them to stop, don't beat him.

946
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,776
 Don't beat him.

947
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,948
 Listen to me, don't beat him.

948
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,119
 Stop it....

949
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,791
 Leave him...

950
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,127
 Why're you beating him?

951
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:49,128
 He didn't kidnap me.
 I myself went with him.

952
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,802
 Is it love?

953
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,803
 I'm asking you, isn't it?

954
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:02,808
 It's love.

955
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,311
 I've no other way to save
 you & love.

956
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,988
 Won't you open your mouth?

957
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,990
 You roam happily while
 falling in love.

958
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,991
 And will you keep quiet
 when a problem crops up.

959
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,836
 Yes, it's love.

960
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,182
 It's not a case of kidnapping.
 It's love.

961
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,183
 I can't help you in this matter.

962
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,355
 As a police, how can you lodge a
 false case of kidnapping?

963
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,531
 You've spoiled my dreams, isn't it?

964
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:00,532
 I'm going to see, that you'll come to
 street as a beggar after you marry him.

965
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,703
 You'll be ruined.

966
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:13,712
 Look, I don't believe in
 auspicious hour, thread, etc...

967
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:19,551
 Promise her that you'll never
 leave her in any situation.

968
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:24,223
 Promise on her head.

969
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,561
 I've no other way to save you.

970
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,426
 Mother...

971
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:00,594
 Mother, please listen to me.

972
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:03,264
 Don't touch me...

973
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:04,932
 Mother, please listen to me.

974
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,933
 Hereafter, don't call me
 as mother.

975
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,936
 Even on that day, you similarly
 had promised on my head.

976
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,279
 I didn't believe when our
 neighbours told me...

977
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:23,615
 Even, when my husband told me
 I didn't believe.

978
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,455
 I really didn't believe him.

979
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:31,456
 I fully believed you, isn't it?

980
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,629
 Hereafter, I don't need you.

981
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,630
 From today, consider that your
 mother is dead.

982
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,134
 Mother...-Look, don't come home.

983
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,135
 Mother...-Move away...come....

984
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,985
 Come here.

985
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,657
 It's common that people who love & marry
 go away from their parents.

986
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,996
 Don't worry.

987
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,997
 Everything will become normal
 within 10 months.

988
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
 Select an auspicious day & marry.

989
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,852
 Brother, llango's selection
 is superb.

990
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,688
 Where did you first meet llango?

991
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,191
 Sister-in-law, I'm the eldest,
 tell me.

992
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:40,027
 Who proposed first?
 Did you or my brother?

993
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,695
 Okay, where is he?

994
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:44,365
 What's it llango?

995
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:47,366
 Can you accommodate her in
 your house for some time?

996
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:49,370
 What're you saying?

997
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:52,371
 You're going to marry her &
 if you suddenly ask me like this...

998
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,043
 What can I do?

999
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,379
 I'm in love with a girl from
 a different caste.

1000
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,881
 My parents nor my relatives shouldn't
 come to know about it.

1001
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:01,715
 If they come to know about this...

1002
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:04,716
 My sisters will have problems
 in their marriage.

1003
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,387
 I'm here, since I had no
 other choice.

1004
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,392
 Now only, my son has
 started to earn.

1005
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,393
 We're getting alliances for my
 daughters because of that.

1006
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:18,063
 At this time, If I accommodate
 her in my house..

1007
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,733
 Even my daughters will be mistaken.

1008
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:34,246
 God, for how many days should I keep
 driving the auto all alone.

1009
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,918
 I didn't get a Government job.

1010
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,919
 Won't you show me a girl
 for me to get married?

1011
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,291
 You sinners.

1012
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,959
 You blind idiots.

1013
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,960
 l thought of getting settled in life
 by attracting a rich man.

1014
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:27,299
 So, I came crawling &
 hit the lamp.

1015
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:30,304
 But, you've put off the
 lamp in haste.

1016
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,638
 You'll be ruined.

1017
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:34,639
 I don't know whether the next person
 comes in a Honda city car or a moped.

1018
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:42,816
 In some corner of this universe...

1019
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:45,817
 I, son of Madurai Mariappan.

1020
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,820
 And you, daughter of some
 Marwadi in Maharashtra...

1021
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,658
 From now, we are lovers.

1022
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:54,659
 Will we ever get united in life?

1023
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:00,501
 We'll unite.

1024
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:01,668
 We'll surely get united.

1025
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,003
 We'll definitely get united.

1026
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,004
 How are we going to get united?

1027
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,344
 Oh! My God! It's time to go.

1028
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,678
 Where is that Hindi film
 being screened?

1029
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,679
 Idiot, I said that it's time,
 I must go home. -Who is it?

1030
01:24:16,351 --> 01:24:18,852
 Sir, I must close the door.
 -You can close.

1031
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,021
 First, you go out.

1032
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:24,022
 Who is sitting over there?

1033
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,860
 Hey, llango.

1034
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,696
 What's this? Why're you sitting here
 at this hour?

1035
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,365
 Who's she?

1036
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:34,366
 Sriram's lover.

1037
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,370
 How did she come here?

1038
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:37,704
 I'll tell you later.

1039
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:40,705
 We're in a critical position where
 we can't stay in our house.

1040
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,212
 What happened is...

1041
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,213
 They might close the doors.

1042
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,715
 You don't have a place to stay, isn't it?
 Come with me.

1043
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:51,716
 Come...Hey, come.

1044
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,053
 Come...

1045
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:01,093
 You're a rose with life.

1046
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,264
 You're a rose who's taking my life.

1047
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:16,274
 I came to pinch you.

1048
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,446
 Since the rose which came to me
 said that I'm her devotee.

1049
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,451
 So, I've kept it in the
 prayer room.

1050
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,290
 I was a lover that day.

1051
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,960
 I'm a guardian for you today.

1052
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,961
 Dear, is this what fate is?

1053
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,466
 It's a cluster of roses.

1054
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,139
 A cluster of roses is near us.

1055
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,140
 It appears in the form of
 thorns in between.

1056
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,184
 If the far away sky comes closer
 it'll become a land.

1057
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,194
 If a closer thing goes far away.

1058
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:47,365
 It's like the waves on the shore.
