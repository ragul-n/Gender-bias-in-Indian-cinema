1
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:38,607
Hey, Dido, what areyou doing here?
I have been Iooking for yousince a Iong time.

2
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,043
Hey, Heer. Be quiet

3
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:42,647
Cannot you see? I am praying
to the saint for something!

4
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,325
TeII me, what are you praying for?ShouId I?

5
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,079
Yes

6
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:50,122
I prayed that wheneverwe pIayHide and seek
he shouId aIways heIpme in finding you

7
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,123
You stiII wiII not be abIeto find me. -Why?

8
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:55,723
The saint beIongs to us. So he'II heIp me to hide

9
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,963
Is it so?
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,326
Then, try hiding.

11
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:00,317
CIose your eyes first !

12
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,196
We wiII orderthe same cook
to make those sweets.

13
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,559
Heer, what are you doing here?

14
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:10,722
I am pIaying hide and seek

15
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,563
With Dido. -Who is Dido?

16
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,279
He has aIso come forthe marriage.

17
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:20,927
This girI is reaIIy strange.
She arrives Iater but makes friends before that !

18
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:24,078
Who wouIdn't want to share a
reIationship With such a pretty girI?

19
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:27,278
In fact, I am thinking of asking for your
daughter's hand for my son.

20
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:39,398
I do not know howmany peopIe wiII come
with proposaIs whenshe reaches the right age.

21
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:45,563
Right now, we shouId be getting invoIved in the joy
of the peopIe forwhose marriage we have come.

22
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,041
We can do that onIy if they free themseIves
from tending toMauju Chaudhary.

23
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:49,600
Mauju Chaudhary has aIso come?-What eIse?

24
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:54,198
Look overthere !Mr. Chaudhary,
it's a matterof pride for any famiIy..

25
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,686
to attend any of yourfamiIy functions !

26
00:01:56,487 --> 00:02:00,002
Then, why wouIdn't we have come?

27
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,277
Hey, Dido ! Come here
Father.

28
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:07,322
We're pIaying hide and seek
He's very naughty

29
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:14,045
He can never sit in one pIace
He is your younger son, is he not?Yes.

30
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:23,442
Father.

31
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:25,605
Heer, my daughter!

32
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,558
What are these peopIe doing here?

33
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,641
The way you were invited,
they were invited in the same way.

34
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,883
And, there's another reason
to invite both of you.

35
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:46,567
And, that is to make you peopIe shake hands with each other.
And to end the enmity between you forever.

36
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,603
Isn't that right? I wiII go and caII them.

37
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:51,917
Come, Chaudhary.

38
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,080
We were waiting for you.

39
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,806
Sister-in-Iaw and the kids have
reached here a Iong time back.

40
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,480
But, why did you take so Iong to come here?

41
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,757
There's no doubt that we took so
Iong to come here.

42
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,605
But, we wont take much time to go from here too !

43
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,319
Junior Chaudhary, what are you taIking about?

44
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,437
There's nothing eIse that I can taIk about !

45
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,276
If you had to caII them here then why did you caII us?

46
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:17,439
Because, on the occasion of my grandson's marriage
I wanted to unite both of you and doubIe the joy.

47
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:19,400
That is impossibIe!

48
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,121
Nothing is impossibIe

49
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:28,685
We wiII taIk about that Iater First, eat
something. - TiII our enemies are here..

50
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:35,838
we wont even drink the water of this house !
In our presence; not onIy of this house..

51
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,077
but they wont be abIe to drink the
water of any house !TeII them!

52
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:43,722
That is because we are used to
drinking bIood in your presence !

53
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:44,478
Speak up!

54
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:47,197
Like before, whose bIood have you come to suck?

55
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,603
Yours, Kehdo. Yours!

56
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,600
Hey, Latif! Pounce on him!

57
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:17,959
Stop it!

58
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,406
What are you peopIe doing

59
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,840
Both of you are dearto me.

60
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,606
Why are you humiIiating me If he
isn't budging then you agree.

61
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,966
Is he the son of some Lord?

62
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,242
Oh God!

63
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:51,195
For God sake ! Stop it!Stop this brutaIity!

64
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,720
Come back to your senses!

65
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,041
Move away! Move away!

66
00:04:56,927 --> 00:05:01,557
The Iove and affection which
made me invite you peopIe..

67
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:09,560
has been shattered since you
peopIe insuIted have that feeIing.

68
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:19,084
You have insuIted me!I do notwant such friendsand reIatives
for my grandson's marriage Go away from here ! Go away !

69
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,525
Even we do not want to stay here !

70
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:26,405
What are you saying? Where such IowIy guests are caIIed..

71
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,722
we do not need to stay there. Come on get up

72
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,879
When wiII we meet again?-When they'II meet.

73
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,119
I wiII pray to God

74
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,485
Come, Heer! Come, Dido!

75
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:50,839
This taIe of Iove is actuaIIy very oId.

76
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:56,926
But with time, it's ways of
presentation keeps changing.

77
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,758
TiII yesterday peopIe narrated it in their own ways.

78
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:05,197
Today, we wiII narrate it
in ourway.

79
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,286
Love is after aII, Iove !

80
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,036
OnIy God knows how
many beIieve in it.

81
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,324
Oh God! Again with
the Iamp!

82
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,607
Every morning and evening
you have the same routine !

83
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,121
Now even this poor Iamp
must be bored !

84
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,800
But you did not give up !

85
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:00,680
Come on, teII me what
were you praying for !

86
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,240
You wiII find out one day.

87
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:03,766
Why are you so impatient?

88
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:07,207
Impatient and me? Seeing
aII this, I have grown up now.

89
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,084
But tiII today, I haven't
found anything !

90
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,685
And you caII me impatient!

91
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,878
The fruits of patience are very sweet.

92
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,877
What wiII you teII her at the right time, Heer?

93
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:20,884
Nothing, mother. Is it necessary to teII you..

94
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,565
what I pray for, in front of the Iamp?

95
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:26,841
Come here! I wiII teII you what girIs pray for.

96
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,283
What eIse can girIs pray for..

97
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:32,400
than for a nice husband?

98
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,842
Papa! Even you are too much.

99
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:39,757
Papa! She is not a chiId anymore.
And do not pamper her so much too !

100
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,956
Or if she sits on your head then it
wiII not be easy to get her off !

101
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:46,806
Do not worry, brother SuItan.
I hope that your head is safe !

102
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,685
No one has to worry
about anything.

103
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:53,085
If I know how to get someone on my head
then I even know how to get them off !

104
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:53,918
Papa!

105
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,242
Come on, wiII you just keep
Ioving or come too? - Come.

106
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,564
Where are you two going?
- To the river bank.

107
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:01,246
To Baradari. The thing is that Zeenat
has returned.. from her in-Iaws' house.

108
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:05,605
And we have caIIed her overthere. Okay, Papa.
Okay, come back soon. - I wiII be back in the evening.

109
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,079
Let's go.

110
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:11,519
Papa! I was thinking about our Iand in Chinchod..

111
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:17,166
I have just Iearnt that there is no one to Iook after it.
So I was thinking that we shouId sent UncIe Kaedo.

112
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,959
No! Do not even think about it !

113
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:22,198
When he'II go, he'II do onIy two things.

114
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,203
First, he'II gather Cannabis
from the peopIe.

115
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,482
Then he'II pIant the
fieIds with it !

116
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,040
Let that Iunatic remain here.

117
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:47,277
Cannabis!No matter how much you praise
the one who created it, it's not enough !

118
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:55,639
If I couId, I wouId pIough the entire fieIds..
in the worId and pIant the Cannabis in them !

119
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:05,405
Wow! -And then I wouId spend my Iife drinking
preparing it and sIeeping in the shade of the intoxication !

120
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,517
Wow!

121
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:07,643
That is great!

122
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:13,482
Great! Just one sip
cooIs my entire body.

123
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:20,323
Strengthens every joint, smartens the brain ceIIs
and provokes the bIood. Wow!

124
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,037
OnIy after drinking this, I am wide awake.

125
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:28,515
I cannot see anything but this. Nothing..

126
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:33,046
HoIy sir, Where are you going? Come.

127
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,799
HoIy Sir,! Where are you going?

128
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,803
If God has given you Iife,
cherish some moments of it.

129
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,437
These guys have prepared a great drink.

130
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,196
In two sips if you do not consider
yourseIf to be God.. then teII me about it.

131
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,718
Oh God! Now you have started
making fun of God too.

132
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:53,118
Oh My

133
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,676
TeII me, Kaedo, why do you
drink so much?

134
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,515
HoIy Sir, this is my medicine.

135
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:02,518
The ointment for my broken Ieg.

136
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,286
After drinking it, aII my pain goes away.

137
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,365
AII my sorrows go wrong.

138
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,476
Why sorrows? Say that you go wrong.

139
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:19,361
Look, this is the reason you couIdn't get married..

140
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:26,040
And you stiII haven't mended yourways
This IoneIiness wiII eat away your entire Iife !

141
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,799
What IoneIiness?

142
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,803
I have my Cannabis with me.

143
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,042
If I have been Iiving with it for so Iong now

144
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,236
can continue
with it too !

145
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:42,447
My principIe now is Drink and Iive Iife, Mr. Judge.

146
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:44,199
Leave the rest to God.

147
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:48,447
You wiII not mend yourways, Kaedo

148
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:53,597
You wiII never mend yourways !
These are aII songs of hopeIessness.

149
00:12:54,687 --> 00:13:02,321
Look Kaedo, being unfaithfuI to others is understandabIe !
But being unfaithfuI to yourseIf is very dangerous.

150
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,837
Did you understand ? I wiII go now. Goodbye.

151
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,442
HoIy Sir, hopeIessness! What hopeIessness?

152
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:17,676
Look there, my hopes are coming this way.

153
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,720
Many hopes are coming together.

154
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:30,045
I say, gorgeous, consider me to be a bouIder
on the road and bump into me

155
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,717
Why just a bump? We have shoes for peopIe Iike you.

156
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,878
WonderfuI! In this way you at Ieast remember me.

157
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:41,204
It seems that this Iame man has had
too much of booze today !

158
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,962
I swear by my Cannabis today that I
wiII not mind if you caII me Iame.

159
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,600
I feeI something tickIing inside my heart !

160
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,727
I have the cure for yourtickIing as weII !

161
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:50,603
WouId you Iike to have it?

162
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:54,276
If you'II give me poison with Iove, I wiII drink that too.

163
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,397
AII of you, take out your shoes.

164
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:02,765
Thank God that I swaIIowed your insuIt
just considering your beauty.

165
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:10,235
Or eIse Kaedo has so much venom in his breath
that onIy a breath is enough to burn the entire worId !

166
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:14,480
Great, uncIe! So today, you want
to burn the worId again?

167
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:16,405
Papa has toId you so many times..

168
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,556
.. not to drink so much !

169
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:22,807
As soon as you get high.. you do not even
know the difference between right and wrong

170
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:27,875
And you and yourfather know everything weII
He Iets his young daughter roam around..

171
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:28,962
and he himseIf has the Hooka at home ! - UncIe!

172
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,522
If some one eIse wouId have said this to me..

173
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,080
then I wouId have given
him such an answerthat..

174
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,522
he wouId have never opened
his mouth in front of me again !

175
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:36,563
Yes!

176
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:40,202
If you say some thing Iike this ever again
there wiII be no one worse than me ! Let's go.

177
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:48,166
May God keep you safe from eviI eyes !

178
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:51,762
Zeenat, you have reaIIy bIoomed
after getting married !

179
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:55,041
Your in-Iaws must be surprised
to see your beauty.

180
00:14:55,327 --> 00:15:00,879
I am confident that there wiII be no girI
as beautifuI as Zeenat at her in-Iaws' house.

181
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,516
Forget about my in-Iaws. In the entire Datthazaara.

182
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,797
there is onIy one girI who is very famous.
Who is it? Who is it?

183
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:09,316
Our Heer!

184
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,003
Me?

185
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,204
But Zeenat, Datthazaara is very far away from our viIIage.

186
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,278
Then how come she is
so famous overthere?

187
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:18,885
I am teIIing the truth, Bego!

188
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:20,759
When the peopIe over
there came to know..

189
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:25,955
that I am from Jungh, then every girI overthere
asked me the same questions How does Heer Iook ?

190
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,955
What does she wear?
What are her hobbies?

191
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:33,563
And when I toId them that
I am Heer's friend..

192
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:37,435
then they touched me
as if they were touching Heer !

193
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,123
What did you teII them ?

194
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,523
I toId them that our
Heer is so beautifuI..

195
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,084
that she wiII get dirty
even if you touch her !

196
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:53,924
Okay, Zeenat, is there reaIIy no girI in Datthazaara
who is more beautifuI than our Heer?

197
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:59,326
The girIs Iook very ordinary. But the boys
overthere arevery handsome. - ReaIIy?

198
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,923
Yes! There is a boy overthere
who is very handsome.

199
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:10,078
A stud! He sings so weII He pIays the fIute so weII
The entire Datthazaara is crazy for him.

200
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,196
Who is he?
Who is he?

201
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:14,284
The youngest son of the IandIord overthere.. Dido!

202
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,043
Dido?

203
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,326
Hey! What are you thinking?

204
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:30,523
Nothing.

205
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,842
Look at her ! She is feeIing shy as if
she knows Dido since many years !

206
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,038
Maybe I know him.

207
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,803
Who knows how he Iooks

208
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,799
Here, Iook at her !

209
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:24,320
She was saying that Dido sits
here everyday to Iook at her.

210
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:29,004
That is why she has Iost her senses
and dropped her vesseI in the weII !

211
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,922
Are we so ugIy that he
comes here onIy to see her?

212
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:38,518
ReaIIy! - I think it's she who comes here
to see him underthe pretext of fiIIing water

213
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:41,719
Why are you jeaIous of her?
He doesn't even care about you.

214
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:45,197
Doesn't matter! At Ieast we
aII care for him. -Yes.

215
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,319
Hey Kamo, Iet's do it !

216
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:03,522
How many times I have toId you not to interrupt me.

217
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:06,884
If not on us, then at Ieast show
some mercy on the sage.

218
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,237
If you keep pIaying fIute
by the sage's tomb.

219
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,996
then the poor sage wiII go insane
not being abIe to sIeep in peace !

220
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,997
First of aII, you need to
get your insanity cured !

221
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,207
Even you have the cure for our insanity
The care for your insanity

222
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,198
found at the medicine man.

223
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,523
PIease, give me some water.

224
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:35,404
You are the onIy medicine
man that we need !

225
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,358
I wiII go right away and
teII your mother.

226
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,678
God knows when you aII wiII be married
and I wiII be reIieved.

227
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:52,325
This.. who was this young man?

228
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,483
Dido, Mauju Chaudhary's youngest son.

229
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:55,084
What happened, sage?

230
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,357
Do you want to make
him a sage too?

231
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,523
He himseIf is the greatest sage.

232
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:05,043
His forehead shows that he is going to be
weII known in the worId.

233
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:13,520
He wiII be famous. He wiII be so famous that his
fame wiII spread aII overthe worIdIike fragrance.

234
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:18,960
And tiII eternity, his fragrance
wiII not be diminished !

235
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:20,596
Oh AIIah!

236
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,362
Our Dido is here! come!

237
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:32,082
Where were you tiII now?- By the tempIe
We have been waiting for you for Iunch since so Iong.

238
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,996
Great, Dido. Come here too.

239
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:40,797
What are you eating there?
Try it with butter here.

240
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,166
What are you aII doing?

241
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,324
Let him freshen up. I am arranging for his Iunch.

242
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:50,086
If you just keep feeding him in bits then
he wiII not be abIeto eat his food weII.

243
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,158
Where? - Here, Dido.
Have some buttermiIk.

244
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,721
And freshen up soon. I wiII
get your Iunch ready.

245
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,004
Here!

246
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:02,721
More buttermiIk! Some more !

247
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,207
Listen, you taIk to him now..

248
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:08,001
What do you want to taIk about, sister-in-Iaw?
You can teII me yourseIf

249
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,685
My eIder brother had
come today..

250
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,081
to taIk about your marriage.

251
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,040
To taIk about my marriage?

252
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,007
I say, with whom are you
getting Dido married?

253
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:17,601
The girI is my uncIe's daughter.

254
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,603
EIder brother had come
to taIk about her.

255
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,081
Is she the onIy girI Ieft
in the entire worId for me?

256
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,965
Why? What fIaws does she have?

257
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,480
When did I say that she
has any fIaws?

258
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,241
But I do not want to marry her.

259
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,005
Then who wiII you marry?

260
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,164
Why are you aII forcing
me get married?

261
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,999
What wiII you gain
from my marriage?

262
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:35,595
We wiII be freed from
our responsibiIity.

263
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,367
And you wiII be freed from
Ioitering around !

264
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,119
Loitering around?
-AbsoIuteIy!

265
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,120
You are aIways roaming about
in every street of the viIIage.

266
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,959
We feeI ashamed when
peopIe teII us.

267
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,562
that you sit by the weII the
entire day and stare at the girIs !

268
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:51,483
They are aII Iying!

269
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,159
Is there any girI
in this viIIage..

270
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,077
worthy enough to be stared at?

271
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,880
ReaIIy! So he thinks no girI
is worthy enough for him !

272
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,195
What does he think of himseIf?

273
00:20:58,247 --> 00:20:59,919
I just feeI that
I am not worthy enough..

274
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,639
forthe sister of my
younger sister-in-Iaw.

275
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:05,760
Yes! Even I wiII see which queen
are you going to marry?

276
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,555
What are you thinking, Dido?

277
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,365
You shouId thank your
younger sister-in-Iaw.

278
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,682
She is arranging your marriage
with her younger sister.

279
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:20,955
Or eIse you..
- Or eIse what?

280
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,042
WouId I remain
a bacheIor aII my Iife?

281
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:25,636
What eIse? Who wouId marry his daughter
to a Iazy man Iike you?

282
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,203
That means I've become a
nuisance for you aII.

283
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:36,438
Do you know anything eIse but to eat free bread
and Ioiter around in the viIIage ?

284
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:40,646
We are aII your servants to
feed you aII the time Here, eat it!

285
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,400
Dido, where are you going
Ieaving the food Iike this?

286
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:50,923
After being insuIted so much.. a respectfuI man wouIdn't
stand here even for a moment

287
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,639
Dido, are you insane?

288
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,560
We are your brothers,
not your enemies.

289
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,006
We aIways mean weII for you.

290
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:58,639
Come, eat yourfood.

291
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:02,316
From now onwards both the food and water
of this house is forbidden for me.

292
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,675
Wait, Dido! Wait..
- Let him go.

293
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,037
He has given us such
threats earIiertoo.

294
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,519
He wiII be back by evening.

295
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,446
Oh righteous AIIah!

296
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,766
You wiII not get any peace here.

297
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,879
You wiII not get it.

298
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:59,084
No matter how many tunes you pIay
You wiII not get the answer

299
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,239
Do not know where, when and in which worId..

300
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:05,397
a part of your identity
was Iost !

301
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,319
Your incompIeteness
is in search of that.

302
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,197
Yes, sage.

303
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:14,077
There is a feeIing of searching
and of incompIeteness too.

304
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:16,757
Now onIy you can
show me the path.

305
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:19,004
I feeI that everything
is corrupt.

306
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:19,877
Oh righteous AIIah!

307
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,484
Your search has the
answerto your peace.

308
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:27,599
Go, search ! Keep searching!

309
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:32,603
It seems that you have a great reIation with the soiI
on the other side of the river, Chenab.

310
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:42,401
Continue searching. TraveI on the path of your incompIeteness
TrampIe your anxiousness and have faith in God!

311
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:48,163
If he wishes, then the moment you step
on the Iand.. of the other side of the river..

312
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:55,677
you may find your destiny.
Go! May God bIess you!

313
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:42,915
Whom are you waiting for at the door?

314
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:46,164
It's aImost nightfaII. But
Dido hasn't returned yet.

315
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:48,602
He never stays out this Iate.
When wiII he come?

316
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:52,361
Sister-in-Iaw, where
wiII he go to?

317
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,919
He might be sitting by the
tempIe and pIaying the fIute He'II be back

318
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:58,839
He hasn't eaten anything
since morning.

319
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:00,765
TiII when he wiII stay hungry?

320
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:02,076
PIease go to him and
convince him to come back.

321
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,803
Fine. I wiII Iook for him.

322
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:10,527
Wait! I wiII come aIong too.

323
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:14,283
Sister-in-Iaw, you do not worry.
We wiII definiteIy bring him back.

324
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,526
The nights are too coId!

325
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:21,837
Hey AbduI, have you
seen our Dido?

326
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,355
No, we haven't seen him. Why?
Where has he gone?

327
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,085
You are worried about him..

328
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,597
the one who God has
created without any worries !

329
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:31,876
I did not understand
anything, sage.

330
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:33,485
But he understood everything.

331
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,758
That is why he has Ieft after asking me
But where did he go after asking you?

332
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,723
Towards his destiny! Towards his fate!

333
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,281
What destiny? What fate, sage?

334
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:47,366
Does anyone know ofa sage's destiny?

335
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:50,763
OnIy He knows weII.

336
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:53,962
OnIy He!

337
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:30,076
So you are here to buy goods!
Even I am here forthat.

338
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,323
Which pIace is this?

339
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,245
This is Baradari! But do not
even dare roam around here.

340
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:43,320
Or you'II be sent back to your
pIace in a bad state. -Why?

341
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,358
Because this Baradari
beIongs to..

342
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:47,602
the arrogant daughter
of Chaudhary, Heer

343
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,761
Why? What happened?

344
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,007
Was this your mischief?

345
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,520
My mischief? What?

346
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,565
Did you do something whiIe
I was asIeep? - No.

347
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,685
But the way you woke up
surprised, made me Iaugh.

348
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:06,243
I do not know when I feII asIeep.

349
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:12,086
And suddenIy I woke up with a strange
sensation. As if someone woke meup forcibIy

350
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,600
You must be dreaming.

351
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:16,605
If you day dream Iike this then
you wiII wake up surprised.

352
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:17,523
Come, Iet's go to Baradari.

353
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:19,877
Where are the rest of the
girIs? - Forget them!

354
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:21,485
Today onIy we wiII enjoy
the boat ride.

355
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:24,246
Today we had fun
on the boat ride.

356
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,602
But why were you teasing
the boatman? - Him!

357
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,356
Who is this, sIeeping on my bed?

358
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,282
Who has dared to do this?

359
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,677
He must be some deviI or some sinner.

360
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,878
He wasn't ashamed or
scared to sIeep here.

361
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:42,757
Do not joke, Bego.

362
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,918
Go and bring that
damned Ludan here.

363
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:47,237
Is this how he guards my Baradari?

364
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,165
Go fast!
- I am going.

365
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:53,756
TiII today no one has dared
to do something Iike that !

366
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:58,081
And Iook at him. Hey! Who are you?

367
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:26,565
It seems the sage has
heIped you to find me.

368
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,162
Dido!
-Yes.

369
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:53,762
Just raise your beautifuI gaze... above this bIooming face.
Let the Iight come to me.

370
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,403
I've been roaming around in darkness since Iong.

371
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,755
Now Iet me gIance at my destiny.

372
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:03,000
It must have been the magic of this beauty..

373
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:05,675
which has showed me the way tiII here.

374
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:12,923
Oh God! Is this just a coincidence
or is it your magic?

375
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:17,522
My heart is sIipping
out of my grip.

376
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:25,797
I stiII do not beIieve that the resuIt of my search
and anxiousness wiII be so extraordinary

377
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:29,562
My restIessness wiII be answered with such greatness.

378
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:34,159
An ordinary man Iike me is destined to be with such a beauty!

379
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:39,075
It maybe or not, but you are the grace of God..

380
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:46,005
which was given to me and I it's my reIigion to praise it
And it's worship is the triaI of my craziness !

381
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:51,161
Enough! Or I wiII be pride of my beauty.

382
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:55,878
It's me who shouId feeI proud
that I was destined to have you.

383
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:58,402
Every vein was restIess !

384
00:30:58,527 --> 00:31:00,518
And even the imaginations
were isoIated !

385
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:05,796
After seeing you, the gardens
of the entire worId.. are at my feet.

386
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,560
Come on, come in.

387
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:10,405
Oh AIIah! No one
shouId find out..

388
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,762
who you are and from where
you have come? - But..

389
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,764
Who is that man? Where is he?

390
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,640
Here, this is that man.

391
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:18,485
Did he say where has he come from?

392
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,046
If he hasn't toId you as yet
then he'II us teII now.

393
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:24,365
I wiII beat him up so good that he'II narrate
his entire famiIy history too !

394
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:26,955
I have heard his story.
TaIk about yourseIf !

395
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,924
Is this how you guard my Baradari?

396
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:32,278
If I Iie, I wiII
drown in the river !

397
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:34,403
I do not know where
he came from.

398
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,598
It was the first time. That is
why I am sparing you.

399
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:41,363
Come, Bego!- Madam, at Ieast teII me
what punishment shouId I give to this imbeciIe.

400
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:45,799
He is a traveIIerfrom some foreign Iand
He Iost his way and Ianded up here.

401
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,565
Make some arrangements
for his stay.

402
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,486
Come, we wiII Ieave.
-You spared him?

403
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:57,519
Sir, is this the onIy pIace
that you found to commit suicide?

404
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,478
What do you mean? I mean to say is that..

405
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:01,603
you wouId have died and
got me kiIIed as weII !

406
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,560
You are hoIding the fIute
as is you are Lord Krishna.

407
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:08,238
Come, I wiII make some
arrangements for your stay.

408
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:10,118
Where? -At the outskirts
of the viIIage. Come.

409
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:18,762
Hey, Heer. Be quiet.

410
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:21,481
Do not you see? I am praying
to the saint for something !

411
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:22,516
TeII me, what are you praying for?

412
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:25,525
I prayed that wheneverwe pIay
hide and seek..

413
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,444
he shouId aIways heIp
me in finding you.

414
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,717
You stiII wiII not be abIe
to find me. -Why?

415
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,002
The saint beIongs to us.

416
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:33,442
So, he'II heIp me to hide !

417
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,245
'The gazes have met. '

418
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:56,759
'Oh God! The days of
diIemmas are here. '

419
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:31,001
'The first sight took my Iife away. '
'Neitherwas there a deniaI nor an approvaI. '

420
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:38,841
'Neitherwas there a deniaI
nor an approvaI. '

421
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,518
'The Iips were seaIed
due to shyness. '

422
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:51,205
'Oh God! The days of
diIemmas are here. '

423
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:55,880
'Oh God! The days of
diIemmas are here. '

424
00:33:55,927 --> 00:34:00,876
I do not know what aIcohoI have you
made me drink with your gaze.

425
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:06,718
God knows when I wiII have controI on myseIf.
I am compIeteIy intoxicated.

426
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:36,843
No!

427
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,277
Do not break this siIence so soon.

428
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,161
Continue pIaying the tunes of yourfIute.

429
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,327
My agony hasn't resided yet.

430
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:54,158
As high is the fIight of yourtunes

431
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:57,358
the depth of your siIence is as deep

432
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,444
Let me feeI it !

433
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:07,717
Even you are the sea of such beauty..
whose waves give fIight to my tunes.

434
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:13,763
And aIso the acceptance to my siIence too
My imagination starts with you

435
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:15,878
and ends with you.

436
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,764
You are my beginning You are my end.

437
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:21,920
OnIy you!

438
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:34,440
'Come, oh beIoved!'

439
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:39,838
'I have caIIed you. '

440
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:46,686
'God has created you for me. '

441
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:49,077
'And me for you. '

442
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:58,082
'God has created you for me.
'And me for you. '

443
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:05,916
'He made us one souI and two bodies. '

444
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:13,118
'He teased your heart for me. '

445
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:15,966
'And my heart for you. '

446
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:25,161
'God has created you for me. '
'And me for you. '

447
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:32,085
'He made us one souI and two bodies.

448
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:42,595
'He teased your heart for me
'And my heart for you

449
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:51,437
God has created you for me 'And me for you

450
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:25,679
Our meeting today is not forthe first time

451
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:31,165
Our meeting today is notforthe first time

452
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:36,603
It was not decided by any of us

453
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,637
'It was by the order
of the Lord. '

454
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:52,886
'What can be done? Oh God,
what can be done?'

455
00:37:54,007 --> 00:38:01,516
God has created you for me
And me for you

456
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:10,436
God has created you for me
And me for you

457
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:57,766
Making Iove the reIigion
of your heart

458
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:03,720
Making Iove the reIigion
of your heart

459
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:08,763
Making it the message
for my God

460
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:24,362
I have taken oaths and made promises
And made promises

461
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:33,157
God has created you for me
And me for you

462
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:50,166
He made us one souI and two bodies
He teased your heart for me 'And my heart for you

463
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:59,240
God has created you for me
And me for you

464
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:04,636
Son, if you take aII the men away from here
then who'II take care of the work here

465
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:08,123
Papa, you shouIdn't have bought
so many Iands in other viIIages.

466
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:10,516
Now that you have bought them,
do not compIaint

467
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:15,325
To teII you the truth we stiII do not have enough men
to take care of such big Iands.

468
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:17,325
That is why I had said
that UncIe Kaedo

469
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,005
Do not take the name
of that imbeciIe

470
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:22,364
If onIy he finds time away from his drinking
wiII he be abIe to find some usefuI men

471
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:27,362
Papa, Ludan was saying that a man
has come from the other side of the river

472
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:28,999
And he is in search of work

473
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,196
Then why haven't you caIIed him here as yet?

474
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,967
I have caIIed him, Papa. Ludan wiII
bring him here today itseIf

475
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:33,365
Good!
- That is great

476
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,802
Mr. Chaudhary! Here
I am, master.

477
00:40:36,007 --> 00:40:38,282
SaIutations to aII.
- SaIutations.

478
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,844
If madam wouId have toId me earIier
that you were Iooking for a man, then

479
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:44,124
What did she teII you

480
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,078
That you were searching
for a servant.

481
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,562
What work can he do? He Iooks so weak

482
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:52,041
No, sir. He reaIIy
knows how to use a staff !

483
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,881
Just give him any work
he'II do it weII.

484
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:55,877
ReaIIy?
-yes.

485
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:57,838
Look, young man, to
work with the animaIs..

486
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:58,956
you'II have to work
Iike an animaI!

487
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,362
We need someone to take
our buffaIoes out ot graze.

488
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:03,563
Even he is an animaI. He is
not a man, he is an animaI.

489
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,837
Have you been drinking
with Kaedo?

490
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:07,923
Let him speak.
- He can taIk to.

491
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,403
Come on ! Say something.

492
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:12,159
Young man, what is your name?

493
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:18,401
It's Ranjha. -Where
have you come from?

494
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:22,637
My parents are not aIive I Iive with my brothers
Theirwives made me quarreI with them.

495
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,285
That is why I ran away from home.

496
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,240
I wouId suggest that we shouId hire him.

497
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:29,399
We aIso have the need and
where wiII he go ?

498
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:31,198
Yes!
- Okay!

499
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,165
SuItan, expIain the work to him

500
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,397
And make arrangements for
his stay in the stabIe. Go!

501
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:38,235
Thank you, sir.
- But this food..

502
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:42,003
Hey, junior Chaudhary,
I saIute you with the staff.

503
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,316
With the staff

504
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,878
Who was the new man with SuItan?

505
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,804
We have hired a new servant.

506
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:50,400
Do servants Iook Iike this?

507
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:54,076
Why, UncIe? Do servants have
a particuIar Iook ?

508
00:41:54,127 --> 00:41:58,484
It doesn't matter if he has a particuIar Iook or not
But you can see the experience on a person's face.

509
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,087
Just Iike we can see
the Cannabis on yourface !

510
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:01,645
Brother, do not take the
name of Cannabis !

511
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:02,517
Of Cannabis!

512
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,037
I have heard a Iot about heaven.

513
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:11,599
But where can I find heaven
otherthan being cIose to you !

514
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:16,841
It is your presence that has
made this cIoseness a heaven.

515
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,965
And due to your Iove this
Heer is Iike a diamond.

516
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:22,563
Or eIse without you..

517
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:25,360
what am I worthy of?

518
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:29,685
Just Iike a person who is anxious
to see his own face in

519
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:35,686
I Iook for myseIf in you and for you in me

520
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,042
After having found you, I can onIy feeI that..

521
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:46,757
I was aIways a part of you
Even I feIt incompIete without you !

522
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:55,318
Now I feeI that I had Ieft
home to settIe down in your heart !

523
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:09,156
Oh God! Who couId that be?

524
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,720
It must be ourfirst test.

525
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:14,557
I am very scared. What if mother
doubts both of us?

526
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:18,682
Then you shouId hide quickIy.
Behind this. I wiII see who is it.

527
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:35,595
Mr. Chaudhary, you? Is
everything aIright?

528
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:39,117
We wiII find that out soon. You
do not worry. Move aside !

529
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,636
Do servants have a
particuIar Iook?

530
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:44,439
Mr. Chaudhary, teII me what
are you Iooking for.

531
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,125
I wiII find it for you.
- Do not act smart !

532
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:47,686
I wiII show it to you right now.

533
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:07,000
Where is she?
-Who are you taIking about?

534
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:08,486
Do you think that Kaedo
is a grazing animaI too ?

535
00:44:08,527 --> 00:44:11,200
We came here running after
Iistening to this drunkard.

536
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:14,444
We shouId have checked first
whether Heerwas in her room or not !

537
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:16,405
After Iistening to him, I
was compIeteIy shocked.

538
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,237
When I saw that she wasn't here,
I thought of it then

539
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,240
You imbeciIe!
- Let's go. - Listen..

540
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:38,802
Papa ! Mother! You at this hour?
Is everything aIright

541
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,760
Yes, dear. Except for yourfooIish
uncIe, the rest is aIright.

542
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,924
What happened to uncIe?
Is he drunk again?

543
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,646
Orwas he scared of
some nightmare?

544
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:50,044
It was I was who was scared.
You can go to sIeep.

545
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:52,402
You can go.
- Come. - But Iisten..

546
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:56,603
Okay uncIe, you can aIso
go to sIeep now. - But..

547
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:07,320
Today you have succeeded in insuIting

548
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:15,439
But you have forgotten that my name is Kaedo
And even God fears conning Kaedo.

549
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:21,406
That means you and Heer used to go to Baradari
aII aIone, hiding from aII of us

550
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:22,163
There must be something
fishy going on !

551
00:45:22,327 --> 00:45:25,000
I feeI as if everything
is fishy

552
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:30,598
So that means that our Heer is going to be someone
eIse's soon. She is not going tobe, she aIready is !

553
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:34,084
TeII us who is it?-Who is it? - I do not know
Come on, teII us TeII us

554
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:36,283
You can aII go and Iook at him.

555
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,126
But where wiII we
find her right now?

556
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,236
Where eIse. At Baradari!

557
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,157
Why did you stop?

558
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:12,165
I was fIying so high with the
heIp of yourtunes.

559
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,517
That is why I stopped !

560
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,445
So that you can come back to me !

561
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:22,201
Do not ever Ieave me even in my imagination !

562
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,558
I wiII be aII aIone.

563
00:46:27,527 --> 00:46:31,645
Without you, my imagination
wiII be incompIete

564
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:35,515
and my dreams wiII
remain unfuIfiIIed

565
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,159
There she is We were Iooking for
you in the entire viIIage.

566
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:41,402
And you are sitting here.

567
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,365
May God have no mercy
on you shameIess girIs

568
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:49,515
We wiII see to it when the time comes But
now, come with us Let's take herto my home Come.

569
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,279
WiII you come easiIy or
wiII we have to force you Come!

570
00:46:57,087 --> 00:47:00,045
No matter how many gIittering stars come together..

my moon is stiII
incomparabIe !

572

It's you who shouId

You were with Ranjha.. and gave the
excuse that youwere meeting us Leave me

575
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:21,202
What drug has Ranjha given you
that you have forgotten your oId friends

576
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:25,676
Hey, teII us the truth
Are you equaIIy attracted to each other?

577
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:27,718
Or is it onIy you who has
faIIen in Iove with him ?

578
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:32,045
I say, she onIy takes Ranjha's name day and night
She has forgotten the worId in Ranjha's Iove.

579
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:38,476

00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:28,242
Ashes

651
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:23,964
These ashes are the graves
of my insuIt..

652
00:55:24,127 --> 00:55:26,038
which wiII rise tiII morning

653
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:29,884
If the ghosts of Iove
pass from here, then.

654
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,476
What is aII this?

655
00:56:30,607 --> 00:56:32,962
The answerto the trap
of uncIe Kaedo.

656
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:34,523
Howcome?

657
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:38,165
You know, he has spread
ashes in the way

658
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:39,322
Anyway, forget him..

659
00:56:42,847 --> 00:56:50,037
Right now I want to forget everything in the worId
except forthe Iove in your arms.

660
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:56,126
'PIease take care, oh my God

661
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:14,157
So that we shouId never be separated

662
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:19,597
Without you this pIace
feIt Iike heII

663
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:22,802
And when you came, it has
turned into heaven !

664
00:57:24,127 --> 00:57:29,724
Ranjha, when I am with you..
then even heII wiII be heaven for me !

665
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,604
This Iight which was
about to bIow out..

666
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:38,484
with your arrivaI, it
brightened up again.

667
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:42,238
You waited very Iong,
did not you?

668
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:45,559
To wait for you is the
support of my Iife, Heer

669
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:50,083
And meeting you is the
beginning of my Iife !

670
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:52,283
It is you who have done
me this favour, Ranjha

671
00:57:52,327 --> 00:57:53,555
There are no favours in Iove.

672
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,044
In Iove both are the same.

673
00:57:57,847 --> 00:58:01,442
The one who gives Iove.
And the one who receives Iove.

674
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:04,556
God has created Iove
in such a way.

675
00:58:05,127 --> 00:58:08,278
that the more you share it,
the more it increases

676
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:21,916
It's aImost morning.

677
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:29,964
First, it was the evening
who used to come between us.

678
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:34,123
Now this morning is
teIIing us to be separated.

679
00:58:34,527 --> 00:58:36,085
Now I wiII Ieave.

680
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:40,803
I wiII be back.

681
00:59:00,087 --> 00:59:01,315
SuItan!

682
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,486
Heer's father, come here quickIy !

683
00:59:04,927 --> 00:59:07,521
Come quickIy and see what
some idiot has done here.

684
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:10,083
Look here. Look at
the porch of our house.

685
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:13,199
Some enemy is trying to caste
an eviI speII on us !

686
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:17,085
May he be ruined ! May Lord
show him no mercy !

687
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:19,595
Look at this !
- Let me see. - Overthere too !

688
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:22,115
Do not worry, sister-in-Iaw
I have done aII this.

689
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:24,001
Not to ruin this house

690
00:59:24,047 --> 00:59:29,599
but to prove that at night,
the ghosts of Iove dance here

691
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:33,602
If you Iook carefuIIy, you wiII
aIso find theirfoot marks

692
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:36,685
The foot marks of ghosts?
-Yes. Of ghosts!

693
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:40,722
I have not onIy been drinking
aII my Iife.. I have some experienced too

694
00:59:41,527 --> 00:59:42,846
Now my brotherwiII beIieve me..

695
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,117
that how Kaedo
has proven it to him!

696
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,119
Look at the foot marks of
the ghosts of Iove ! Look !

697
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:55,358
There are foot marks. But
Iooking at them..

698
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,519
it seems that the
ghost was Iame

699
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:05,446
It seems so, uncIe.

700
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:10,636
Were you dancing after
drinking..

701
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,598
when I Ieft in the night?
-What rubbish are you taIking?

702
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:15,764
Even I feeI the same way!
You are the onIy one..

703
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:17,002
who waIks on one Ieg and
a stick, uncIe

704
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:20,407
And the marks are aIso
of one foot and a stick !

705
01:00:20,407 --> 01:00:21,886
Do you want to prove anything eIse ?

706
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:24,766
Mr. Chaudhary! What happened?

707
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:29,119
Why are these ashes spread
over aII this pIace?

708
01:00:29,327 --> 01:00:29,998
You go and do yourwork

709
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:31,646
Listen, did you see anyone
here Iast night?

710
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:35,323
When I woke up in the morning
to feed the cows..

711
01:00:35,487 --> 01:00:36,840
I saw junior
Chaudhary here.

712
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,764
I thought he was taking
a morning waIk.

713
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:40,121
So I did not ask him.

714
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:42,801
You Iiar ! How dare you !
-Why are you scoIding him, uncIe

715
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:46,483
when you do not remember
anything yourseIf Do not drink so much

716
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:47,482
You can go now.

717
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,246
You shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf !

718
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:55,399
If your chiId has a fIaw,
you shouId try and hide it !

719
01:00:55,647 --> 01:00:58,844
But you.. You are trying
to ruin my famiIy name !

720
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,276
Oh God! Come Heer. Come inside.

721
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:04,365
ShameIess man!
- Come papa!

722
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,599
It's not his fauIt,
but it's the drinking !

723
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:08,796
Do not Iisten to him.

724
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,839
He'II straighten up himseIf.
Let's go.

725
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:12,958
Go away! You can never
straighten out a dog's taiI !

726
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,963
Brother..
- Shut up!

727
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:19,121
How can the taiI of the
dog be straightened out?

728
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:24,800
Every hair of this taiI has
hidden many secrets of this house !

729
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:27,602
The day this taiI
straightens out..

730
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,998
every secret wiII
be exposed and spread out !

731
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:31,886
Let the time come, Chaudhary.

732
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:36,205
Then I wiII show you how this
dog straightens out its taiI !

733
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:45,358
If the angeIs find out how
deIicious the food is that you cook.

734
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:46,516
they'II aIso come
down to the earth !

735
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:49,878
ReaIIy? That is why this
cunning angeI.

736
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:53,676
came here secretIy,
hiding from everyone

737
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:57,639
But aII this whiIe you've just
been taIking more and eating Iess !

738
01:01:57,687 --> 01:01:58,881
But I am eating!
-What..

739
01:02:01,607 --> 01:02:02,960
Someone is headed this way.

740
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:04,516
I wiII hide overthere.

741
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:07,678
Oh AIIah!

742
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:10,765
If I do not have anything, then
may you not have anything too

743
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:11,557
What kind of a sage are you?

744
01:02:12,047 --> 01:02:15,278
Instead of praising the
Lord, you are cursing him !

745
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:22,438
everyday, I wiII aIso praise
the Lord aII the time

746
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:22,919
UncIe!

747
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:27,684
Then take this. You may eat it.
But do not curse AIIah ! Just thank him.

748
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:28,882
Why shouIdn't I thank him now?

749
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:31,323
Just wait and see, not onIy AIIah
I wiII praise you too !

750
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:35,845
AIIah, you are great

751
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:41,807
Ranjha, why did you give
yourfood to him?

752
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:42,922
Why? What happened?

753
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:46,238
Did not you see that he did not eat
the food but he hid it in his sack ?

754
01:02:46,647 --> 01:02:49,400
He was not a sage but uncIe
Kaedo disguised as a sage !

755
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:51,837
He was Kaedo?
-Yes. Oh God!

756
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:52,844
Who knows what wiII
he teII everyone at home now ?

757
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,361
What shouId I do?

758
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:00,199
Just wait here.
I wiII be right back.

759
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:03,599
Baego!

760
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:07,120
Baego, come fast!
-What's wrong?

761
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:09,926
A catastrophe !
-What happened?

762
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:11,241
UncIe disguised himseIf as a sage..

763
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:12,846
and took food from
Ranjha by deceiving him

764
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:14,764
Come fast ! Before
he reaches home..

765
01:03:14,847 --> 01:03:16,599
and creates a scene there,
we must do something

766
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:18,365
Your Ranjha is such an idiot !
Where is your uncIe?

767
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:19,921
He is headed that way!
- Come, Iet's go.

768
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:36,286
Hey, this uncIe pIaying
a new game today !

769
01:03:37,007 --> 01:03:40,283
You just come with me.
If I do not make your uncIe..

770
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:42,522
dance to my tunes today,
I wiII change my name !

771
01:03:42,687 --> 01:03:43,517
Come !
- Come !

772
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:49,205
Oh God! It seems to
be some wiId animaI !

773
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,085
Let's chase him away or
eIse he'II destroy the crops !

774
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:51,718
Here, take this.

775
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:56,238
These smaII pebbIes
are not enough.

776
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,527
Pick up a big stone..

777
01:03:57,527 --> 01:03:58,118
No!

778
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,756
You have disturbed a sage today.

779
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:03,196
Oh Sage, pIease forgive us !

780
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:06,165
We have a few questions to ask.
WouId you answerthem?

781
01:04:06,287 --> 01:04:07,083
I do not have the time.

782
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,840
If sages do not have time,
then who has it?

783
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:11,480
Fine! You can ask me.

784
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:14,764
Not Iike this, sage. We wiII
sit comfortabIy and ask you.

785
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:16,445
It's a question of
Iife and death for us!

786
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:18,398
Come underthe shade !
- Come !

787
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:22,195
Hey, the sage is Iame !
- Come !

788
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:25,685
Come. Sit here.

789
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:28,800
Okay, you can ask me
whatever you want, quickIy !

790
01:04:28,847 --> 01:04:33,284
Okay, teII us, wiII our Shaddo.. marry a deaf guy or a Iame guy?

791
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:36,160
She'II be fortunate
to marry a Iame man !

792
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:39,680
Okay, now teII us, if Gamo wiII
marry a dumb or a deaf guy?

793
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,437
After marriage he'II go dumb.
And then soon, he'II go deaf !

794
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:46,082
Okay, enough now ! Let me go ! Enough now !
Oh Sage! Just one more thing.

795
01:04:46,207 --> 01:04:48,562
Our Heer has very crueI
uncIe named Kaedo.

796
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:51,158
When wiII he die?

797
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:55,320
He wiII not die that easiIy.

798
01:04:55,607 --> 01:04:58,041
He wiII kiII many peopIe
before he dies. - Oh God!

799
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:02,240
Why do you want to get
my uncIe kiIIed?

800
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:04,921
Because that Iame man aIways
bIocks ourway !

801
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:08,199
He drooIs Iike a dog ! May
he suffer great agony !

802
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:11,803
Sage, show us some way that
the dog breaks his back !

803
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:14,316
And we girIs wiII be
rid of him !

804
01:05:14,487 --> 01:05:16,842
He wiII not die that easiIy !
-Why is that?

805
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:21,127
Because if his back breaks then the backs
of everyone in his famiIy wiII break too !

806
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:21,684
How come?

807
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:23,366
Do not Iet the sage speak iII.

808
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:27,162
Just understand that very
soon, yourfriend..

809
01:05:27,207 --> 01:05:28,401
wiII run away
with her servant !

810
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:31,282
I wiII Ieave now! Oh AIIah!

811
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:33,956
TaIk to him cIearIy.

812
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:36,123
UntiI we do not get
SuItan married..

813
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,839
we wiII not even think
of getting Heer married

814
01:05:38,007 --> 01:05:39,918
I have aIready expIained
to Zaida's father

815
01:05:40,647 --> 01:05:42,239
But Zaida's mother
just wiII not Iisten

816
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:45,165
She just keep on sending
messages through peopIe

817
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:46,846
It was good that
we did not agree.

818
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:51,517
Or eIse, if we taIk to Heer about her marriage..
then she just gives up eating

819
01:05:51,967 --> 01:05:54,322
She just stops eating !

820
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:57,206
But you wiII faII down after
hearing what I have to say !

821
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,207
Hey! Who has Iet this
mad man inside?

822
01:05:59,207 --> 01:05:59,957
Hey, who are you?

823
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:03,677
So.. now your brother Kaedo
has become a stranger

824
01:06:03,807 --> 01:06:05,718
Hey Kaedo, what has
happened to you?

825
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:07,883
Who has painted yourface
bIack? - I, myseIf

826
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:11,200
Before your daughter disgraces
this famiIy..

827
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,999
I have painted my face bIack

828
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:14,562

01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:17,320
yourface bIackened ! -What
are rubbish are you taIking?

830
01:06:17,367 --> 01:06:19,961
I used to speak rubbish! You
considered me to be a dog.

831
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:21,680
I am aIways intoxicated !

832
01:06:22,047 --> 01:06:24,197
But do not know what
drug she gives you.

833
01:06:24,407 --> 01:06:26,238
that you are deceived
by her everyday !

834
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:29,279
You are smoking Hookah here
and your daughter

835
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:32,006
is throwing mud on your
honor in your own fieIds !

836
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:36,399
She prepares this deIicious food daiIy..
.. and feeds that cowherd herseIf ! Look at this !

837
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:43,884
What is this?
- It's food. It was food.

838
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:47,721
Is this food? Is it? Are
you drunk again?

839
01:06:47,847 --> 01:06:49,997
Where have you coIIected
aII this dirt from?

840
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,162
Mend yourways

841
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:52,886
If you bIame my daughter again..

842
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:54,280
no wiII be abIe to stop
me

843
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:55,482
Now get Iost from here !

844
01:06:57,087 --> 01:07:00,318
UncIe, you? What's aII this?

845
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:03,035
Are you drunk again ?

846
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,516
He has gone nuts

847
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,317
I do not know, if he has gone
nuts or has he had drugs ?

848
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:09,198
Look, he is showing us
dirt saying that it's food !

849
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:26,156
It is your presence that has
made this cIoseness a heaven.

850
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:30,443
And due to your Iove, this
Heer is Iike a diamond.

851
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,445
Or eIse without you..

852
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,403
what am I worthy of?

853
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:42,682
It seems that the ghost was Iame!

854
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:46,916
Is this food? Is it

855
01:07:48,487 --> 01:07:49,237
Are you drunk again?

856
01:07:49,847 --> 01:07:51,758
Where have you coIIected
aII this dirt from?

857
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:52,797
Mend yourways!

858
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:54,605
If you bIame my daughter again..

859
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:57,281
no wiII be abIe to stop me!
Now get Iost from here!

860
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:04,963
But what do you intend to say?

861
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,436
Now what is Ieft to say,
Mr. Chaudhary?

862
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:14,605
I just wanted to teII you that I
couId not sIeep the entire night.

863
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:16,439
I just kept thinking the
whoIe night about.

864
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:19,325
what has happened to me?

865
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,559
Then what happened after
you thought?

866
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:23,799
OnIy this that aII of
you were right!

867
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:26,523
I have gone nuts!

868
01:08:27,247 --> 01:08:29,317
Drinking has ruined
my abiIity to think.

869
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:35,362
That is why I keep bIaming
my virtuous chiId.

870
01:08:38,007 --> 01:08:41,636
Anyways, whatever happened
has happened! But.. No, Chaudhary.

871
01:08:42,607 --> 01:08:44,837
It was good that you sIapped me.

872
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:47,277
Or eIse I wouId not
have reaIized my mistake!

873
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:48,716
Forget it, uncIe

874
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:51,918
Now teII us what have
you have thought forthe future.

875
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:56,842
First, I wouId get myseIf
mentaIIy treated.

876
01:08:57,287 --> 01:09:01,041
I have heard that a very famous
doctor.. Iives near Rangpur

877
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:05,958
And he cures mad and
mentaIIy iII peopIe.

878
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:14,796
If SuItan can take me there, then not just you..
but even me, I wiII be cured of this iIIness.

879
01:09:15,127 --> 01:09:16,924
Thank God that you have
thought of getting treated.

880
01:09:17,127 --> 01:09:19,004
We wiII aIways stand by you
for your good deeds.

881
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:22,006
SuItan, go with him. And
take uncIe to the doctor.

882
01:09:22,127 --> 01:09:24,960
And tiII uncIe isn't cured,
stay with him to take care of him. Okay, father.

883
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:25,798
Okay, Chaudhary.

884
01:09:26,367 --> 01:09:28,881
Forgive me once again Forget it Now go.

885
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:37,642
No one can say when time and
a person's mind change!

886
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,040
ReaIIy? I cannot beIieve it!

887
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:46,597
Even I couId not beIieve
it tiII I saw SuItan.. taking him away fortreatment.

888
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:55,643
So that means your uncIe wiII now drink the doctor's..
bitter medicine instead of Cannabis!

889
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,281
And your Ranjha, he wiII dream
about you day and night..

890
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,803
and take your Iove to great
heights! - ShameIess girI!

891
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:10,481
'In my courtyard.

892
01:10:12,247 --> 01:10:18,117
an unknown stranger has come

893
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:29,806
from nowhere

894
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:38,284
'Oh God! The days of
diIemma are here. '

895
01:10:40,087 --> 01:10:45,844
'Oh God! The days of
diIemma are here. '

896
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:03,280
'Love is just a form of God. '

897
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:15,764
It is the resuIt of prayers

898
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:21,515
It is the resuIt of prayers

899
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:29,284
'I wish we couId pray together.

900
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:41,039
'Oh God! The days of
diIemma are here. '

901
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:02,525
Here, Iook at this

902
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:07,879
See the naked picture of betrayaI.
and fraud by your own bIood, Chaudhary!

903
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:15,000
Can you stiII deny that your name has been ruined?
TiII today I have been burning in this fire aII by myseIf.

904
01:12:15,287 --> 01:12:16,959
But now It is yourturn.

905
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,198
Betrayer! I wiII..
- No! No, SuItan.

906
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:27,558
No, mother. Let me go!

907
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:29,764
I wiII kiII both of them today!

908
01:12:29,807 --> 01:12:32,082
No, SuItan. PeopIe do
not know about it as yet.

909
01:12:32,207 --> 01:12:34,641
If you kiII him,
everyone wiII come to know.

910
01:12:35,287 --> 01:12:38,677
Anyway, this treacherous girI
has aIready ruined our name!

911
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:41,003
And you, scoundreI!
Get out of here!

912
01:12:41,527 --> 01:12:42,642
Get Iost from here!

913
01:12:42,807 --> 01:12:46,641
No, mother. It is not
his fauIt. Father..

914
01:12:46,727 --> 01:12:51,596
I wish I couId wash away your
sins with your dirty bIood!

915
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:54,407
I wish I had beIieved
what Kaedo was saying!

916
01:12:54,447 --> 01:12:57,086
But no! No! I was bIinded!

917
01:12:57,367 --> 01:13:00,325
Your Iove and affection
had bIinded me!

918
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:03,279
No, Mr. Chaudhary,
she is innocent.

919
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:04,357
But if you..

920
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:07,285
Father, do not hit him!
- Come on, you shameIess girI!

921
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:09,404
Mother, you take this
insoIent girI home.

922
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:11,239
And I wiII take care of
this rascaI. Come!

923
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:14,240
Do not hit him! Let him go.

924
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:17,246
Do not hit him, brother SuItan.

925
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:26,163
Bastard! If you show your
face here again..

926
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:32,007
then I wiII chop you into piecess
and bury you here itseIf! Understood?

927
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:49,405
Dad, I beg of you. Consider it
as my fate and agree to it.

928
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:51,326
Consider yourfatherto be dead.

929
01:13:51,647 --> 01:13:54,559
You have proved your insoIence!

930
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:58,840
You have buried yourfather
aIive with shame!

931
01:13:59,127 --> 01:14:01,880
No, dad. You can kiII
me if you want.

932
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:05,801
But do not trash me with
such words. PIease do not!

933
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:08,959
If you have so much regret now,
then why didn't you..

934
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:10,886
kiII yourseIf before
betraying us?

935
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,598
Now teII me, Chaudhary, from how many
peopIe.. can you hide yourface?

936
01:14:15,207 --> 01:14:17,038
Now say that she is not
your beIoved daughter..

937
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,959
but that she has
ruined your honor!

938
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:21,123
Now teII me wiII you poison
your own daughter

939
01:14:21,287 --> 01:14:23,801
or keep hiding your
face from the society?

940
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:27,245
My dreams have been
kiIIed with my Iove.

941
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:31,596
I am shattered! I cannot
understand anything!

942
01:14:32,527 --> 01:14:35,325
Now you decide what you
want to do with her.

943
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,802
Father! Father!

944
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:40,957
Sister-in-Iaw, if you
keep quiet..

945
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:43,117
.then this matter
wiII not be soIved.

946
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,036
Just think of how to deaI with her!

947
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:49,165
Zaida's mother had sent
many proposaIs.

948
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:53,276
But what if she aIso refuses
on finding out about her!

949
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:55,643
No, mother. Have mercy on me.

950
01:14:55,847 --> 01:14:56,438
Consider your motherto be dead!

951
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:59,240
Betrayer, today you have
destroyed aII reIations with us!

952
01:14:59,487 --> 01:15:01,478
Before she gets the news
about this incident..

953
01:15:01,607 --> 01:15:04,041
we shouId take the proposaI

954
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:04,719
Come with me

955
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,204
No, mother! Do not do this, mother!
Do not caII me your mother!

956
01:15:08,687 --> 01:15:12,157
You have ruined my name for
the sake of that cowherd!

957
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:14,437
No, mother. He is not a cowherd.

958
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:17,280
Then who is he?

959
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,559
TeII me, who is he?

960
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:24,243
Mother, you have to promise me!
Do not teII anyone.

961
01:15:25,327 --> 01:15:31,004
He is the youngest son
of Mauju Chaudhary.. from Taktadari, Ranjha!

962
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:37,483
Yes, mother.
- Oh AIIah!

963
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:41,645
Mother, he used to Iive her
Iike a cowherd for me.

964
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:46,238
You have toId me this.

965
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:49,000
But do not teII anyone
eIse about this.

966
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:53,320
Orthese peopIe wiII chop you both into pieces..
.. and throw you in the river!- Mother!

967
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:01,478
I am teIIing you.
Forget staying here!

968
01:16:01,607 --> 01:16:03,996
Anyways there are many
peopIe staying here.

969
01:16:04,207 --> 01:16:08,167
We'II go to my home. And
There we'II decide.. what we have to do next.

970
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,805
Now I cannot understand anything.

971
01:16:10,807 --> 01:16:13,162
It feeI as if everything
is over.

972
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:16,485
My friend, this war has been
fought since ages.

973
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:18,445
And Iove has aIways
been victorious.

974
01:16:18,847 --> 01:16:20,917
And you have aIready
given up the fight!

975
01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:23,237
The first shock is aIways
hard to bear!

976
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:25,845
Then it becomes a habit.

977
01:16:25,887 --> 01:16:27,684
I sense weakness from
this word 'habit'.

978
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:30,680
And my friend, do not
make toIerance a habit!

979
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:31,398
No, Ludan.

980
01:16:32,767 --> 01:16:34,917
There is so much fire ready
to burn in my heart.

981
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,520
that there is onIy
one sign needed from Heer!

982
01:16:40,007 --> 01:16:42,441
And this fire wiII burn
down the entire worId.

983
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:43,998
But I aIso fear..

984
01:16:44,047 --> 01:16:49,485
that in my haste, Heer
shouIdn't get burned too!

985
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:02,082
Here, eat something.

986
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:07,844
PIease eat something. You are
going to regret it forever

987
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:12,757
Oh my God! This is your age to be happy..

988
01:17:13,527 --> 01:17:15,643
and Iook what you
have done to yourseIf?

989
01:17:16,527 --> 01:17:20,122
You couId not keep up your prestige.
And you ruined our prestige too!

990
01:17:21,247 --> 01:17:24,603
Now we are neither among
the Iiving northe dead!

991
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:27,720
Do not say that, mother!

992
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:30,085
You know me very weII.

993
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:31,687
If I had known you weII then..

994
01:17:31,687 --> 01:17:32,802
this wouId
have never happened!

995
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:37,236
Now I have to hide my face Iike
a thief in my own house.

996
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:41,564
Yourfather, who has the reputation..
to stand up against the entire worId..

997
01:17:43,447 --> 01:17:47,838
today he is hiding in
shame in a dark room!

998
01:17:49,887 --> 01:17:54,881
Forget about eating, even aftertrying so much..
he has not even taken a drop of water!

999
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,199
Now who shaII we
teII about this?

1000
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,397
Our own bIood has betrayed us!

1001
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:28,638
Father! Father!

1002
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:37,479
Let it be. Let there
be darkness!

1003
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:41,440
When I see yourface
in the Iight..

1004
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:45,161
I feeI even more
ashamed of myseIf!

1005
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:47,765
No, father! No!

1006
01:18:48,927 --> 01:18:50,360
I am your cuIprit.

1007
01:18:51,047 --> 01:18:52,844
You can punish me however you want.

1008
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:57,567
But.. but pIease do not do
this to yourseIf!

1009
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:01,321
This must have been written in my fate..

1010
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:04,238
hat aII that is mine
wiII be burned down!

1011
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:09,404
Yourtears wiII bring down
my worId, father!

1012
01:19:10,207 --> 01:19:12,004
It wiII crash my worId!

1013
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:15,003
You are my onIy hope.

1014
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:28,166
You have shaken my confidence and my identity.
You have destroyed my courage!

1015
01:19:28,967 --> 01:19:33,245
EarIier, no one ever couId even dared to Iook at me..

1016
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:40,439
Today.. today you have made me so worthIess..
that I cannot Iook into anyone's eyes to taIk to them!

1017
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:45,804
My own bIood.. my own
bIood has betrayed me!

1018
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:46,804
Father!

1019
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:50,006
I have betrayed no one.

1020
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,006
BeIieve me, father!

1021
01:19:57,007 --> 01:20:00,682
The reIationship of trust is greater
than the reIationship of bIood!

1022
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:03,801
The reIationship of bIood is onIy
Iimited tiII emotions.

1023
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:06,963
But God dweIIs in the
reIationship of trust.

1024
01:20:07,847 --> 01:20:10,759
If you have trust, then you have God.
If you do not trust, thenyou do not have God!

1025
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:16,397
BeIieve me, father!
I am innocent! I am innocent!

1026
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:20,480
PIease forgive me!
PIease forgive me!

1027
01:20:37,607 --> 01:20:42,044
'I couId not Ieave my beIoved!'

1028
01:20:44,247 --> 01:20:48,718
'I have given up
the worId instead!'

1029
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:54,965
'Even after knowing
that Iove is such an iIIness.. '

1031

Iovers are made of!'

1033
01:21:14,527 --> 01:21:20,284
'These crazy humans do not even fear God. '

1034
01:21:22,087 --> 01:21:24,760
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1035

you is my reIigion. '

1038
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:40,322
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1039
01:21:59,927 --> 01:22:02,919
'Forgetting about this worId..
this entire worId.. '

1040
01:22:03,807 --> 01:22:06,924
'Forgetting about his entire
worId, I have heId your hand. '

1041
01:22:07,887 --> 01:22:10,640
'We may either die together now!'

1042
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:14,876
'Orwe may Iive happiIy after getting married!'

1043
01:22:15,287 --> 01:22:17,881
'I want to Iive with you. '

1044
01:22:19,687 --> 01:22:22,918
'I want to die with you. '

1045
01:22:24,647 --> 01:22:27,161
'Love is just a drop of fire. '

1046
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:30,716
'And every drop has a storm. '

1047
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:34,800
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1048

'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1049

1052
01:23:42,287 --> 01:23:44,562
'In one of the streets
of this viIIage.. '

1053
01:23:54,047 --> 01:23:56,436
Iives a girI named Heer. '

1054
01:23:59,207 --> 01:24:08,798
'The fate of Ranjha..
is written on the doors of Heer's home!'

1056
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:19,246

'In Iove, I can achieve the
impossibIe!'

1066
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:14,203
'If I Iive without Heer, then
I wiII have a bad name

'I wiII kiII myseIf chanting
Heer's name. '

1068
01:25:25,807 --> 01:25:32,155
'Let the worId take my
test, if it wants to!'

1069
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,800
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1070
01:25:36,247 --> 01:25:39,683
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1071
01:25:39,727 --> 01:25:40,364
Listen Chaudhary, there is
nothing to be hasty about.

1072
01:25:40,407 --> 01:25:43,205
'PeopIe give up their hearts in
Iove, but I wiII give up my Iife. '

1073
01:25:44,127 --> 01:25:47,039
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1074
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:50,842
'My name is Iover. To Iove
you is my reIigion. '

1075
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:05,637
Listen Chaudhary, there is
nothing to be hasty about.

1076
01:26:07,967 --> 01:26:10,083
Why cannot we aII work
out something?

1077
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:15,598
The way you are my reIatives, in the same way..
the peopIe from Rangpur are my reIatives too!

1078
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,802
ActuaIIy, the thing is that
Zaida had many proposaIs.

1079
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:27,886
But his mothertoId me thatI shouId teII
you to consider... Zaida's proposaI for Heer.

1080
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:30,322
What's there to consider?

1081
01:26:30,687 --> 01:26:32,120
You are our eIder.

1082
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:35,081
And the peopIe of Rangpur are
not strangers for us.

1083
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:37,119
A girI is a anyway a temporary
responsibiIity!

1084
01:26:37,607 --> 01:26:39,563
She has to go a different
house someday.

1085
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:42,562
Heer is bIessed with
a great famiIy.

1086
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,721
And the proposaI has
come from their side.

1087
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:49,398
You aII shouId be
happy about it.

1088
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:54,438
But it seems that you
are not happy about it.

1089
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:59,521
Mr. Chaudhary, my daughter
is very dearto me

1090
01:27:00,407 --> 01:27:04,480
It is the first time
I am thinking about.. getting her married.

1091
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:10,998
That is why for me, aII
this doesn't seems... to be a reaI but a dream!

1092
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:13,885
A very beautifuI dream!
A fortunate dream..

1093
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:17,125
which every daughter's father
waits to fuIfiII

1094
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:19,477
and a daughter aIso
dreams about it!

1095
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:21,722
And I am that dream,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1096
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:30,683
You scoundreI! It seems that
your death has brought you here

1097
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:32,559
Today you wiII not go back
aIive from here.

1098
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:39,839
Go away from here, you imbeciIe! If you
want to Iive then

1099
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:43,403
If one is firm in their aims... then
death is just asacrifice, Mr. Chaudhary.

1100
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:46,284
And my aim is my Iove.

1101
01:27:46,607 --> 01:27:49,246
I can sacrifice my
many Iives for it!

1102
01:27:51,807 --> 01:27:52,956
Why have you come here?

1103
01:27:53,207 --> 01:27:55,357
These peopIe wiII kiII you.
Go away from here!

1104
01:27:55,487 --> 01:27:57,205
You bastard, I wiII not
spare you!

1105
01:27:57,247 --> 01:27:59,477
You have been Iiving on our
morceIs, you worthIess sIave!

1106
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:03,361
No, brother SuItan! - I am not a sIave.
If you are not a sIave then who are you?

1107
01:28:03,527 --> 01:28:05,677
No, father. He is nobody!

1108
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:10,438
Go away from here! For God's
sake, go away from here! Consider me dead!

1109
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:12,365
If we cannot meet.. in this worId
then we'II meet in some otherworId.

1110
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:14,239
But I beg of you, pIease Ieave!

1111
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:15,322
How can I Ieave?

1112
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:18,847
Today fate has given
the decision..

1113
01:28:18,847 --> 01:28:20,838
.. of my Iife and death
to yourfather.

1114
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:23,279
After reaching here
and backing out now..

1115
01:28:23,327 --> 01:28:27,206
.. I wouId rather choose to
die here! -You scoundreI!

1116
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:30,441
Before I shut your
mouth forever..

1117
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,201
teII us who are your reIatives?

1118
01:28:33,967 --> 01:28:36,561
Why do not you say something?
Who are you?

1119
01:28:37,767 --> 01:28:41,396
I am Dido, the son of Mauju
Chaudhary from Datthazaara.

1120
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:51,161
So Mauju has found this way
to take revenge on us!

1121
01:28:51,607 --> 01:28:57,045
But for ruining our prestige,
we'II behead his son!

1122
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:59,282
No!
- Get aside!

1123
01:28:59,727 --> 01:29:01,001
Mauju has died Iong ago.

1124
01:29:01,047 --> 01:29:02,162
What wiII you gain from his death?

1125
01:29:02,207 --> 01:29:02,957
Get aside, Chaudhary.

1126
01:29:03,007 --> 01:29:05,965
He is the son of my enemy.
I wiII kiII him!

1127
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:07,725
Come to your senses.

1128
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,756
As your son SuItan is dearto me..

1129
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:14,205
.. so is this son of Mauju!

1130
01:29:14,687 --> 01:29:17,645
You cannot kiII him tiII I am aIive!

1131
01:29:17,807 --> 01:29:20,765
If you want to kiII someone, then kiII me!

1132
01:29:20,807 --> 01:29:23,924
C'mon, behead me! Cut me into pieces!

1133
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,319
Father, you shouId kiII me!

1134
01:29:26,367 --> 01:29:27,880
AII the quarreIs wiII be over.

1135
01:29:27,927 --> 01:29:31,044
Heer's father, for God's sake,
Iet's forget aII this now!

1136
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:35,679
Oh God! Oh God, whatis this treachery?

1137
01:29:36,087 --> 01:29:39,716
My enemy, even after his death,
has Ieft his son..

1138
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:42,281
.. and in my own house, my own bIood..

1139
01:29:42,327 --> 01:29:47,765
they are dishonoring me
and I cannot do a thing!

1140
01:29:48,527 --> 01:29:50,199
How can I bearthis?

1141
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:53,764
How can I bearthis?

1142
01:30:03,007 --> 01:30:08,206
If It is a sin to be a son, then
I am ready forthe punishment.

1143
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:10,286
But my conscience knows that..

1144
01:30:10,727 --> 01:30:13,480
.. our enmity had got overwith
the death of my father!

1145
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:16,397
But now, when there is no enemy Ieft..

1146
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:21,284
But if you stiII feeI that It is
your duty to kiII me..

1147
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:23,196
.. then I am ready for it!

1148
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:27,362
Father! Father, have mercy
on my condition.

1149
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:31,204
My Iife depends on your
consent or your rejection!

1150
01:30:31,887 --> 01:30:33,479
Father, I beg of you!

1151
01:30:34,247 --> 01:30:36,363
PIease grant me the favor
of your approvaI.

1152
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:40,765
Chaudhary, where the Iimits
of enmity and pride end..

1153
01:30:41,287 --> 01:30:43,482
from there the Iimits of Iove begin.

1154
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:46,522
In orderto aboIish the feeIing of revenge..

1155
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:48,326
.. you do not need anyone's
bIood but you need..

1156
01:30:49,207 --> 01:30:51,277
.. the storm of emotions!

1157
01:30:53,327 --> 01:30:54,965
Let the poison of
enmity that is there within you..

1158
01:30:55,487 --> 01:30:57,637
be washed away by the tears
of these innocent chiIdren!

1159
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:03,127
Look Chaudhary,
I have never bowed my head..

1160
01:31:03,127 --> 01:31:05,880
.. in front of anyone otherthan God.

1161
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:10,845
Forthe sake of the hoIy Iove
of these innocent chiIdren..

1162
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:15,164
I pIace my turban at
yourfeet, Chaudhary!

1163
01:31:15,207 --> 01:31:17,198
No, no, no!

1164
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:23,762
No. TeII this shameIess boy
to go back to his viIIage..

1165
01:31:23,807 --> 01:31:26,321
.. and ask some eIderIy
person from his house..

1166
01:31:26,367 --> 01:31:27,277
.. to come here.

1167
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:30,163
TiII they do not come toour house personaIIy..

1168
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:32,723
there is no question of
my consent or rejection!

1169
01:31:33,687 --> 01:31:35,643
After aII, there are some
ruIes for everything.

1170
01:31:35,967 --> 01:31:37,559
There are some ruIes for everything.

1171
01:31:44,887 --> 01:31:48,766
My chiIdren! May God be
generous to you!

1172
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:53,283
Chaudhary!

1173
01:32:00,967 --> 01:32:02,082
Shame on you!

1174
01:32:02,127 --> 01:32:03,480
Have you no seIf-esteem Ieft?

1175
01:32:03,927 --> 01:32:06,316
And aIong with that, you
have aIso kiIIed mine!

1176
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:08,839
Those enemies, who had tried to maIign not onIy me..

1177
01:32:08,887 --> 01:32:10,843
but the entire viIIage, you are going to have..

1178
01:32:10,887 --> 01:32:12,718
a reIationship with them!

1179
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:14,765
Look at my Ieg!

1180
01:32:15,247 --> 01:32:16,919
This is the resuIt off their
eviI deeds, to whom.

1181
01:32:17,247 --> 01:32:19,477
you are going to give your
daughter as a gift of Iove!

1182
01:32:19,847 --> 01:32:21,246
It is better if you went
somewhere and kiIIed YourseIf!

1183
01:32:21,447 --> 01:32:23,287
Keep yourtongue in check,
Kedo or eIse..

1184
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,481
Or eIse, what wiII you do?

1185
01:32:24,807 --> 01:32:28,561
I am stiII mourning about
becoming handicap..

1186
01:32:29,207 --> 01:32:32,358
And I have been trying forget this pain
... by drinking aII throughout my Iife!

1187
01:32:32,407 --> 01:32:34,637
Because of this,
I have not even been married!

1188
01:32:34,687 --> 01:32:36,120
And you are marrying your
daughter off to your enemies!

1189
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:38,160
Listen to one thing carefuIIy.

1190
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:41,317
The entire viIIage is against
those scoundreIs.

1191
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:42,436
No matter if you do not stand by me..

1192
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:44,280
but the entire community
is with me!

1193
01:32:44,647 --> 01:32:46,319
If they wiII bring their marriage
procession to this viIIage..

1194
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:48,000
then they wiII not go back aIive!

1195
01:32:52,327 --> 01:32:55,285
You have come back aIive!
That is indeed something great!

1196
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:58,203
But afterthis, if you do not doubt.

1197
01:32:58,247 --> 01:33:00,124
their intentions,
then it wouId be yourfooIishness!

1198
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,487
The Iove of Chochak
Chaudhary's daughter and..

1199
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:04,762
Adham Chaudhary has
compIeteIy changed him.

1200
01:33:05,287 --> 01:33:06,163
I can see that!

1201
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:10,883
Yourwounds are a proof of that!

1202
01:33:11,327 --> 01:33:13,045
My instincts cannot be wrong!

1203
01:33:13,807 --> 01:33:16,924
I have seen that man meIting
with my own eyes!

1204
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:21,677
Look Dido, if you wouId not have come
back safeIy.. from our enemy's house

1205
01:33:22,607 --> 01:33:25,167
Iike this then may be.. You can
continue your grudges Iater on.

1206
01:33:25,207 --> 01:33:26,720
But first, Iet us find a
soIution to this probIem.

1207
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:28,885
The onIy soIution to this probIem is that..

1208
01:33:28,927 --> 01:33:32,203
instead of sending the
message of our reIationship..

1209
01:33:32,247 --> 01:33:34,841
we shouId send the message of
revenge to those scoundreIs!

1210
01:33:35,447 --> 01:33:37,517
They wiII have to pay
for every wound of his!

1211
01:33:37,567 --> 01:33:39,558
For God's sake, pIease do
not bring your enmity.

1212
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:40,842
into my Iove!

1213
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:47,886
I do not know how my Heer must
be waiting for me, counting

1214
01:33:47,927 --> 01:33:49,804
her breath and Iiving
every second.

1215
01:33:50,527 --> 01:33:54,440
of her Iife Iike an age!

1216
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:09,279
'O beIoved Ranjha,
O beIoved Ranjha!'

1217
01:34:10,007 --> 01:34:14,558
'O my beIoved Ranjha!'

1218
01:34:16,127 --> 01:34:29,245
'Come, my heart is caIIing out for you. '

1219
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:39,403
'The AImighty has made you for me, me for you. '

1220
01:34:40,567 --> 01:34:48,804
'The AImighty has made you for me, me for you. '

1221
01:34:50,127 --> 01:34:59,081
'He made Iove and then he broke it into two'

1222
01:34:59,607 --> 01:35:08,276
'He has made my heart eagerfor
you, your heart for mine. '

1223
01:35:09,327 --> 01:35:18,156
'The AImighty has made you for me, me for you. '

1224
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:26,840
'The AImighty has made you for me, me for you. '

1225
01:35:34,487 --> 01:35:36,007
SaIutations, Mr. Chaudhary!

1226
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:36,917
SaIutations!

1227
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:40,285
You are Chochak Chaudhary,
aren't you?

1228
01:35:40,327 --> 01:35:41,646
Yes, I am. Who are you?

1229
01:35:42,447 --> 01:35:46,918
I have brought this message
from Mauju Chaudhary's sons.

1230
01:35:47,247 --> 01:35:49,397
Fine. Fine. Sit down.

1231
01:35:50,007 --> 01:35:51,725
Someone get some waterfor him!

1232
01:35:57,447 --> 01:36:02,316
Chochak Chaudhary, we respect
your cowardIiness.. and your negIigence.

1233
01:36:05,767 --> 01:36:10,716
Maybe even your daughter has
inherited this quaIity from you.

1234
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:20,157
The girI, who can betray her
father, wiII she spare us?

1235
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:23,923
After so much enmity, how did
you think that we wouId.

1236
01:36:23,967 --> 01:36:27,403
get your daughter married to brother?

1237
01:36:27,807 --> 01:36:29,843
A reIationship with yourfamiIy
is a far off thing!

1238
01:36:29,887 --> 01:36:31,445
We do not even Iike spitting on aII of you!

1239
01:36:31,487 --> 01:36:34,479
With Iots of humiIiation, the sons of your enemy.

1240
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,960
Father, what happened?
What happened?

1241
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:46,044
Are there any orders for me, Mr. Chaudhary?

1242
01:36:46,087 --> 01:36:48,396
If any son of Mauju wouId have
come in your pIace then..

1243
01:36:49,007 --> 01:36:52,238
I wouId have torn him to
bits instead of tearing this Ietter!

1244
01:36:52,727 --> 01:36:53,796
Go. Go from here!

1245
01:36:53,847 --> 01:36:56,645
Before I kiII you, get Iost from here!

1246
01:36:58,967 --> 01:37:02,755
No. This is a Iie.

1247
01:37:03,727 --> 01:37:05,922
I think it is someone's eviIpIanning!

1248
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:07,522
He wiII definiteIy come.

1249
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,839
He wiII break off even his bIood
reIations and come.

1250
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:12,040
Make father understand, mother.

1251
01:37:12,607 --> 01:37:13,887
TeII him not to take any decisions in a hurry.

1252
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:16,526
Where have you given me the scope..
of taking any decisions now?

1253
01:37:17,847 --> 01:37:23,399
To keep you smiIing, the way I have kiIIed.
my seIf-respect! OnIy my conscience knows that!

1254
01:37:24,367 --> 01:37:26,278
I have continued this enmity for aII my Iife and

1255
01:37:26,327 --> 01:37:28,079
I have never Iost!
I have never Iost!

1256
01:37:28,447 --> 01:37:32,122
Today, because of you, he has
defeated me in my own house!

1257
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,044
He spat on my face and Ieft!

1258
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:35,236
He spat and Ieft!

1259
01:37:35,287 --> 01:37:36,845
Father! - I am being punished..

1260
01:37:36,887 --> 01:37:38,400
for being yourfather. Yes.

1261
01:37:38,807 --> 01:37:43,039
Father, my good father, God
is testing us Iike this.

1262
01:37:44,007 --> 01:37:45,565
PIease support me for some more time!

1263
01:37:46,087 --> 01:37:49,397
DefiniteIy, it is someone's eviI
pIan in sending this Ietter!

1264
01:37:49,887 --> 01:37:52,321
Even he wiII convince his brothers!

1265
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:57,960
Just give us some more time!

1266
01:37:58,447 --> 01:38:01,567
Heer's father, when you have
taken such a big step..

1267
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:03,603
wait for some more time more!

1268
01:38:03,847 --> 01:38:06,361
How do I wait? How?

1269
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:08,325
That shameIess Kedo is going about

1270
01:38:08,367 --> 01:38:09,959
provoking the entire community!

1271
01:38:10,247 --> 01:38:12,044
Tomorrow, if he gathers
everyone and brings them here..

1272
01:38:12,087 --> 01:38:13,839
then what answerwiII I give them?
What answerwiII I give?

1273
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:16,485
I have become heIpIess!

1274
01:38:17,127 --> 01:38:18,879
I have become compIeteIy heIpIess!

1275
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:21,116
Father!

1276
01:38:21,887 --> 01:38:23,525
WeII done!

1277
01:38:25,207 --> 01:38:28,916
To make an arrogant man
heIpIess is Iike haIf the success!

1278
01:38:29,327 --> 01:38:32,080
You are absoIuteIy right, master.

1279
01:38:32,847 --> 01:38:35,805
If there is any otherthing
that I can do, pIease teII me.

1280
01:38:35,847 --> 01:38:37,519
If there is a need again,
I wiII caII you!

1281
01:38:37,887 --> 01:38:39,240
Now you go from the back!

1282
01:38:39,567 --> 01:38:40,761
Take care of one thing.

1283
01:38:41,007 --> 01:38:44,397
TiII I do not caII you, do not
be seen anywhere.. nearthis viIIage!

1284
01:38:44,767 --> 01:38:45,677
Fine, master.

1285
01:38:48,447 --> 01:38:53,965
Now the hot iron needs to be hit
by the hammer.. of the community!.

1286
01:38:55,967 --> 01:38:59,357
Chaudhary, on one side is your mad daughter.

1287
01:38:59,807 --> 01:39:04,005
And on the other side, the enmity which
we have.. since generations with Takhttazaara!.

1288
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:11,160
Now teII us Chaudhary, wiII you go to the enemies..
with your daughter orwiII you support us?

1289
01:39:11,367 --> 01:39:13,164
TeII us, Chaudhary. TeII us.

1290
01:39:13,687 --> 01:39:20,843
I am in such a probIem that
I do not have any answer.

1291
01:39:21,967 --> 01:39:30,127
It is sad that those who burned
my house down.. are my own peopIe!

1292
01:39:30,127 --> 01:39:32,800
Now Iisten to this, now
we have become strangers!

1293
01:39:32,847 --> 01:39:35,202
Why do not you say Chaudhary that
It is you.. who has become a traitor?

1294
01:39:35,367 --> 01:39:35,958
UncIe?

1295
01:39:36,007 --> 01:39:37,520
You keep quiet, Kedo.

1296
01:39:37,887 --> 01:39:38,956
We have caIIed him.

1297
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:40,686
So Iet us taIk to him.

1298
01:39:41,047 --> 01:39:43,197
Yes Chaudhary, now teII us.

1299
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:47,685
Are you with us orwith your daughter?

1300
01:39:49,647 --> 01:39:53,879
O AImighty, where
have you brought me today?

1301
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:57,678
On one side my unfortunate daughter..

1302
01:39:57,727 --> 01:40:01,356
is waiting eagerIy and on
the other side, my brother..

1303
01:40:01,407 --> 01:40:03,841
is asking me for IoyaIty!

1304
01:40:04,847 --> 01:40:06,246
On one side is this community and..

1305
01:40:06,527 --> 01:40:07,846
on the other, is my pride!

1306
01:40:08,407 --> 01:40:11,479
At this point, I am compIeteIy aIone, my Lord!

1307
01:40:11,527 --> 01:40:13,995
No father, you are not aIone!

1308
01:40:14,207 --> 01:40:15,401
I am aIso with you!

1309
01:40:15,607 --> 01:40:18,440
The onIy difference is that
I know my goaI! Leave me!

1310
01:40:18,487 --> 01:40:21,285
Just go inside! At Ieast
show some respect towards me!

1311
01:40:21,487 --> 01:40:23,796
How dare you come here, siIIy girI?

1312
01:40:24,367 --> 01:40:26,407
Go inside or eIse I wiII Tear you to pieces!

1313
01:40:26,407 --> 01:40:27,760
Leave me! - Stop SuItan!

1314
01:40:28,047 --> 01:40:29,526
We are not strangers.

1315
01:40:30,167 --> 01:40:32,522
She is Iike our daughter.

1316
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:34,482
I wiII taIk to her.

1317
01:40:35,927 --> 01:40:40,637
Look daughter Heer, because
of aII this nuisance..

1318
01:40:40,687 --> 01:40:43,440
Soni was drowned and kiIIed.

1319
01:40:43,767 --> 01:40:48,443
Because of aII this nuisance,
Shashi had been.. kiIIed in the desert!

1320
01:40:49,807 --> 01:40:52,082
ChiIdren who go against their parent's wishes..

1321
01:40:52,127 --> 01:40:54,402
what has been happening to them since ages..

1322
01:40:54,447 --> 01:40:56,722
Iearn some thing from that.

1323
01:40:56,767 --> 01:40:59,440
Otherwise even you wiII face
the same consequences.

1324
01:40:59,647 --> 01:41:00,841
This is what I regret.

1325
01:41:01,967 --> 01:41:03,958
You aII are very crueI.

1326
01:41:04,967 --> 01:41:10,166
PowerfuI peopIe of this society Iike you have
kiIIed Shashi.. and Soni in the fire of your enmity.

1327
01:41:10,807 --> 01:41:13,879
And today, you are singing the
songs of Shashi's.. and Soni's Iove.

1328
01:41:14,247 --> 01:41:16,636
You are recounting the taIes of their sufferings.

1329
01:41:16,927 --> 01:41:20,761
And now, you aII of you want
to throw me into that same fire!

1330
01:41:20,967 --> 01:41:22,320
You siIIy girI!

1331
01:41:22,687 --> 01:41:26,475
Even God does not forgive a rebeIIious chiId.

1332
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:31,718
Your pride and your stubbornness wiII kiII you.

1333
01:41:32,247 --> 01:41:34,477
O unfortunate one! Be a IittIe sensibIe!

1334
01:41:35,127 --> 01:41:38,483
OnIy the fortunate get a good Iife!

1335
01:41:39,127 --> 01:41:43,564
Before taking your advice, I wouId Iike to ask aII
the.. peopIe in the community that who is the man.

1336
01:41:43,887 --> 01:41:47,482
who has never had any Iover?

1337
01:41:47,687 --> 01:41:49,405
Whom he has never Ioved?

1338
01:41:49,887 --> 01:41:51,798
I wouId Iike to make an
announcement in this city..

1339
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:54,675
of cowards that I have Ioved
someone.. and I haven't sinned!

1340
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:55,921
You shameIess girI!

1341
01:41:57,247 --> 01:42:00,205
Unfortunate girI! I wiII bury you aIive!

1342
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:01,919
No, Ieave me! No!
- Come with me.

1343
01:42:02,487 --> 01:42:04,478
On this earth, where daughters
are treated Iike this..

1344
01:42:04,767 --> 01:42:06,325
God wiII never shower his generosity!

1345
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:08,523
God wiII neverforgive you aII!

1346
01:42:09,087 --> 01:42:09,997
He wiII neverforgive you!

1347
01:42:10,287 --> 01:42:11,242
Leave me!

1348
01:42:12,487 --> 01:42:15,047
It is a shame!

1349
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:17,840
She is not a daughter. She
is a burden. She is a risk.

1350
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:20,640
God forbid! Her craze wiII destroy us!

1351
01:42:20,687 --> 01:42:22,040
Did you see his daughter?

1352
01:42:22,487 --> 01:42:24,045
Even our daughters may protest now!

1353
01:42:24,087 --> 01:42:25,600
She has spat on his face today!

1354
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:27,239
Tomorrow, even our daughters wiII spit on us!

1355
01:42:28,367 --> 01:42:30,676
The water has gone over our heads.

1356
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:37,956
Before this storm destroys the entire viIIage..

1357
01:42:38,007 --> 01:42:40,919
Chaudhary, get her married immediateIy!

1358
01:42:41,567 --> 01:42:43,876
But with whom?
-With Zaida.

1359
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:47,558
No one can get a better house that that!

1360
01:42:47,727 --> 01:42:49,240
If we give them our approvaI..

1361
01:42:49,447 --> 01:42:51,403
they wiII come with the wedding procession.

1362
01:42:51,887 --> 01:42:54,242
O God, pIease forgive me!

1363
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,798
Maybe this is good for everyone.

1364
01:42:57,167 --> 01:42:58,600
Fine Kedo, fine.

1365
01:42:59,287 --> 01:43:00,242
I agree.

1366
01:43:01,447 --> 01:43:04,598
Dido. Dido. Dido!

1367
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:09,678
You have Iost your senses
Iiving with those rascaIs..

1368
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:14,521
that you are ready to Ieave yourfamiIy,
your brothers.. forthe daughter of the enemy!

1369
01:43:15,087 --> 01:43:18,443
The wounds haven't heaIed as yet!

1370
01:43:18,807 --> 01:43:20,798
And you want to go near death again.

1371
01:43:21,167 --> 01:43:22,964
Maybe, I am nearerto death
by coming back here!

1372
01:43:24,487 --> 01:43:26,284
There, my Iife wiII be waiting for me.

1373
01:43:27,407 --> 01:43:31,685
To Iive without herwiII
be worse than death for me!

1374
01:43:32,727 --> 01:43:34,524
Now I cannot wait any Ionger!

1375
01:43:35,567 --> 01:43:38,764
I do not know what she
wiII be going through?

1376
01:43:39,647 --> 01:43:40,363
Dido!

1377
01:43:44,647 --> 01:43:48,765
This procession Iooks Iike
someone's funeraI gathering to me!

1378
01:43:48,807 --> 01:43:51,685
Where the priest has soId his
seIf-esteem.. there wiII be funeraIs!

1379
01:43:51,887 --> 01:43:53,639
May that IowIy Kedo be destroyed!

1380
01:43:53,687 --> 01:43:55,405
AII this is due to his eviI deeds!

1381
01:43:55,607 --> 01:43:57,438
I think everyone is invoIved in this.

1382
01:43:57,887 --> 01:44:00,879
Otherwise they wouId have aIIowed us to sit..
near Heer during the wedding, wouId not they?

1383
01:44:00,927 --> 01:44:02,076
How wiII they aIIow us to sit?

1384
01:44:02,127 --> 01:44:04,846
WiII not they feeI ashamed whiIe
forcing herto agree?

1385
01:44:06,007 --> 01:44:08,123
I do not think that she wiII agree easiIy.

1386
01:44:08,327 --> 01:44:09,521
Why do I agree?

1387
01:44:10,047 --> 01:44:12,356
Because you want it, this
community wants it..

1388
01:44:12,407 --> 01:44:13,157
aII this peopIe want it?

1389
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:14,641
This is my wedding.

1390
01:44:14,967 --> 01:44:18,807
To agree or disagree is onIy
my right. Go, I disagree.

1391
01:44:18,807 --> 01:44:21,275
You rascaI! I wiII puII out yourtongue!

1392
01:44:21,967 --> 01:44:23,036
Look, wiII you agree or not?

1393
01:44:23,087 --> 01:44:23,997
No, no!

1394
01:44:24,527 --> 01:44:26,006
KiII me! Poison me!

1395
01:44:26,367 --> 01:44:28,597
But do not poison my Iife!

1396
01:44:28,967 --> 01:44:34,360
Love! It is the resuIt of aII
the unIimited desires of the heart!

1397
01:44:34,527 --> 01:44:35,960
An outcome of young bIood!

1398
01:44:36,007 --> 01:44:42,242
An announcement of revoIt
against the community!

1399
01:44:43,927 --> 01:44:48,079
Look girI, now it is not your personaI matter.

1400
01:44:48,687 --> 01:44:55,487
It has todo with the insuIting
of the entire community..

1401
01:44:55,487 --> 01:44:58,126
and no one can save you from this punishment!

1402
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:06,598
I accept aII the punishment of this worId but I do not
accept.. the punishment of being separated from my Ranjha!

1403
01:45:07,007 --> 01:45:09,237
I wiII bury you aIive!

1404
01:45:09,767 --> 01:45:10,802
I agree!

1405
01:45:11,087 --> 01:45:13,920
I wiII get you bitten by mad dogs!

1406
01:45:13,967 --> 01:45:15,036
I agree!

1407
01:45:15,887 --> 01:45:18,799
I wiII make you sIeep on the bed of fire!

1408
01:45:18,847 --> 01:45:21,964
I agree!
- I wiII burn you in fire!

1409
01:45:22,207 --> 01:45:23,847
I agree! - I wiII..

1410
01:45:23,847 --> 01:45:25,485
I agree to everything.

1411
01:45:26,447 --> 01:45:28,324
I agree to aII those punishments aIso..

1412
01:45:28,367 --> 01:45:29,277
which you do not remember!

1413
01:45:29,927 --> 01:45:31,963
But I do not agree to go with Kedo.

1414
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:40,047
GirI, you do not know how strict our Iaws are!

1415
01:45:40,047 --> 01:45:41,560
O bIind peopIe of the two worIds!

1416
01:45:42,647 --> 01:45:45,400
How do I show you the mirror of my true Iove?

1417
01:45:45,727 --> 01:45:47,365
You are bothered about this worId and..

1418
01:45:48,087 --> 01:45:49,679
I am bothered about some otherworId.

1419
01:45:50,007 --> 01:45:51,884
You have to do your duty

1420
01:45:53,287 --> 01:45:54,606
and I have to do mine!

1421
01:45:54,647 --> 01:45:55,921
Stop this nonsense!

1422
01:45:56,647 --> 01:45:58,365
Now this procession wiII not
go back from here Iike this!

1423
01:45:59,167 --> 01:46:01,761
Either you wiII go in the
paIanquin or your corpse!

1424
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:06,559
My corpse wiII go! I wiII not go.

1425
01:46:07,007 --> 01:46:08,235
SuItan, caII yourfather.

1426
01:46:08,527 --> 01:46:10,324
This girI wiII not spare us!

1427
01:46:11,327 --> 01:46:15,036
O God, what a shameIess girI she is!

1428
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:20,080
She doesn't have any respect for
her reIigion. and her customs!

1429
01:46:20,527 --> 01:46:22,483
In the name of customs, you are
seIIing your seIf-respect..

1430
01:46:22,527 --> 01:46:24,119
and why are you maIigning the customs?

1431
01:46:24,887 --> 01:46:27,162
My Iove is my customs and my reIigion!

1432
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:29,565
The base of aII the reIigions is Iove!

1433
01:46:29,847 --> 01:46:33,283
And there is no reIigion greaterthan Iove!

1434
01:46:33,327 --> 01:46:36,637
The Iove which is not for God is a sin, girI!

1435
01:46:36,687 --> 01:46:40,805
Love is such a thing, priest that
it turns a human being into God!

1436
01:46:42,287 --> 01:46:44,357
My Ranjha has become my God!

1437
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:46,880
Let me remember him!

1438
01:46:47,567 --> 01:46:51,924
The person who wiII interfere
in my reminiscence is.. guiIty in my eyes!

1439
01:46:53,167 --> 01:46:55,522
May you be maIigned in both the worIds!

1440
01:46:55,967 --> 01:46:58,527
You caIIed me guiIt!.

1441
01:46:58,847 --> 01:47:00,963
Where is he? Where is Choudhary?

1442
01:47:01,287 --> 01:47:02,561
My daughter is not feeIing weII.

1443
01:47:02,607 --> 01:47:03,835
That maybe the reason forthis deIay.

1444
01:47:03,887 --> 01:47:05,798
You may be right on your part, Mr. Choudhary.

1445
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:07,805
But there is a Iimit to waiting as weII!

1446
01:47:08,247 --> 01:47:10,317
I feeI as if my patience is mocking me!

1447
01:47:10,367 --> 01:47:11,800
No son, do not taIk Iike this!

1448
01:47:12,047 --> 01:47:15,483
Look Choudhary, we wiII not
toIerate it fortoo Iong now!

1449
01:47:15,807 --> 01:47:17,843
Even if we have to take the procession back..

1450
01:47:18,167 --> 01:47:20,522
Choudhary, do not
do this crueIty. No, no!

1451
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:22,762
Father. PIease come here.

1452
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:24,397
I wiII just come back.

1453
01:47:26,447 --> 01:47:28,438
I can see that the indications are not good.

1454
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:33,766
If anything goes wrong, then we wiII
not spare.. these scoundreIs aIso!

1455
01:47:39,647 --> 01:47:41,922
Father, my good father!

1456
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:43,316
PIease save me!

1457
01:47:43,567 --> 01:47:45,285
I do not have anyone except you!

1458
01:47:46,087 --> 01:47:48,476
PIease save me father!
PIease save me!

1459
01:47:49,007 --> 01:47:53,125
I have come to beg you to save me!

1460
01:47:54,487 --> 01:47:58,400
My daughter, give me your
approvaI as a donation!

1461
01:48:02,047 --> 01:48:02,763
Father!

1462
01:48:04,567 --> 01:48:05,397
No father!

1463
01:48:09,927 --> 01:48:11,599
No. No!

1464
01:48:12,327 --> 01:48:17,082
Yourfather is a beggar
standing on yourthreshoId!

1465
01:48:24,087 --> 01:48:25,918
Now It is yourwish!
- No!

1466
01:48:25,967 --> 01:48:28,242
If you want to, you can
kick it or eIse you can..

1467
01:48:28,447 --> 01:48:29,880
give me some more time to Iive.

1468
01:48:31,167 --> 01:48:32,839
No father, no!

1469
01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:33,922
No. No!

1470
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:45,523
If today, your paIanquin wiII not go..

1471
01:48:46,487 --> 01:48:50,400
the entire procession wiII
be a part of my funeraI! Yes.

1472
01:49:11,887 --> 01:49:12,956
Father!

1473
01:49:22,687 --> 01:49:24,564
O God! - Do not deIay it!

1474
01:49:25,487 --> 01:49:27,478
Keeping the turban back on
herfather's head means

1475
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:28,277
that she has agreed.

1476
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:29,915
Go out and announce her approvaI

1477
01:49:29,967 --> 01:49:31,161
otherwise they wiII go away.

1478
01:49:31,407 --> 01:49:32,886
But.. - This is not the time to think about it.

1479
01:49:32,927 --> 01:49:34,360
If this wedding wiII not
take pIace today then..

1480
01:49:34,647 --> 01:49:36,205
tomorrow who wiII Iisten to you? Hurry up!

1481
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,636
But we need a witness!

1482
01:49:37,687 --> 01:49:39,006
We have SuItan as ourwitness.

1483
01:49:40,047 --> 01:49:42,117
Do not waste time otherwise
they wiII go away.

1484
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:43,361
Take this and go away.

1485
01:49:46,287 --> 01:49:46,924
Go!

1486
01:49:52,607 --> 01:49:53,562
CongratuIations!

1487
01:49:53,767 --> 01:49:54,597
CongratuIations!

1488
01:49:54,807 --> 01:49:56,445
She has consented!

1489
01:49:56,647 --> 01:49:57,284
CongratuIations!

1490
01:49:57,887 --> 01:49:58,842
CongratuIations!

1491
01:49:59,007 --> 01:49:59,598
CongratuIations!

1492
01:50:13,407 --> 01:50:17,764
My God, even the day of
judgement wiII be very scary!

1493
01:50:18,687 --> 01:50:20,564
But there is a hope that I wiII be forgiven!

1494
01:50:21,367 --> 01:50:24,757
But here, I am sacred of being
trapped from everywhere!

1495
01:50:32,727 --> 01:50:36,117
Come, cry as much as you want to cry!

1496
01:50:38,527 --> 01:50:41,564
I do not know when we wiII get
a chance to cry Iike this.

1497
01:50:46,527 --> 01:50:52,159
TeII him that it was not my
wedding but my death!

1498
01:50:54,047 --> 01:50:55,275
I am going with my funeraI procession.

1499
01:50:56,807 --> 01:50:59,241
I wiII wait for him in my grave.

1500
01:51:18,767 --> 01:51:20,041
CongratuIations, mother!

1501
01:51:20,767 --> 01:51:23,156
You have saved your honor..

1502
01:51:24,087 --> 01:51:27,841
but your conscience wiII never Iet
you be in peace.. for kiIIing my Iove!

1503
01:51:29,247 --> 01:51:31,715
Even if you cry aII your Iife.

1504
01:51:40,647 --> 01:51:43,002
The scoundreI who
soId himseIf in the name of..

1505
01:51:44,087 --> 01:51:45,486
reIigion, on judgement day..

1506
01:51:46,207 --> 01:51:48,641
you wiII have to account for your greediness!

1507
01:51:57,207 --> 01:52:00,199
O God, if you are there somewhere then.

1508
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:03,202
show him the mirror of the truth of my Iove

1509
01:52:04,687 --> 01:52:07,838
so that he can see that not onIy his face but

1510
01:52:08,527 --> 01:52:10,165
his conscience is aIso very ugIy!

1511
01:52:13,967 --> 01:52:19,724
Wow brother! A brother has AIways been
the symboI of. his sister's protection!

1512
01:52:21,007 --> 01:52:22,804
Today, you have proved that wrong!

1513
01:52:41,287 --> 01:52:44,643
Father, one day, for my happiness..

1514
01:52:45,647 --> 01:52:50,516
you had swaIIowed your pride and
agreed. to my wedding with Ranjha.

1515
01:52:51,607 --> 01:52:56,203
Today, for your happiness, I
have given up my Iove.

1516
01:52:57,367 --> 01:52:59,085
by covering myseIf in siIence!

1517
01:53:01,727 --> 01:53:08,565
We are even now! Good-bye!

1518
01:54:11,847 --> 01:54:18,400
'We are ready to face any consequences. '

1519
01:54:19,287 --> 01:54:25,920
'Do not separate us, God is on the way. '

1520
01:54:27,087 --> 01:54:33,879
'Love has given birth to us severaI times. '

1521
01:54:34,927 --> 01:54:41,082
'But this worId has kiIIed us everytime. '

1522
01:54:42,127 --> 01:54:48,805
'Sometimes they caIIed us Shireen Farhad. '

1523
01:54:49,407 --> 01:54:57,997
'Sometimes they have caIIed us LaiIa Majnu. '

1524
01:54:59,327 --> 01:55:04,799
'This worId has given us so many names. '

1525
01:55:09,927 --> 01:55:15,524
'This worId has given us so many names. '

1526
01:55:23,487 --> 01:55:26,718
Ranjha, you have come back after so Iong!
Where were you since so many days?

1527
01:55:26,767 --> 01:55:27,517
Why? What happened?

1528
01:55:28,247 --> 01:55:29,157
Is everything aII right?

1529
01:55:29,767 --> 01:55:31,405
How is Heer? Did she meet you anytime?

1530
01:55:31,607 --> 01:55:33,518
She did not meet me and now
she wiII never meet me.

1531
01:55:33,887 --> 01:55:37,436
Why? -You did not come back and that Kedo..
was setting up his eviI pIans.

1532
01:55:37,927 --> 01:55:38,882
The Khede's have come with the procession.

1533
01:55:39,047 --> 01:55:41,322
She must aIready have been married
by now and Ieft! -What?

1534
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:41,844
Yes.

1535
01:55:54,087 --> 01:55:55,884
Bego, where is my Heer?

1536
01:55:55,967 --> 01:55:58,647
You have come now when
everything is over!

1537
01:55:58,647 --> 01:55:59,716
But where is she?

1538
01:56:00,367 --> 01:56:02,323
She has asked me to teII you
that it wasn't a wedding..

1539
01:56:03,007 --> 01:56:04,201
but herfuneraI!

1540
01:56:04,887 --> 01:56:06,161
The Khede's have taken her corpse away!

1541
01:56:07,247 --> 01:56:09,397
She wiII wait for you over There, in her grave.

1542
01:56:50,807 --> 01:56:57,360
O angeIs of God! Set forth your rivers of fire!
Burn everything with the fIames of yourfire!

1543
01:56:58,407 --> 01:57:07,076
May there be darkness everywhere!

1544
01:57:08,007 --> 01:57:10,999
Bury the Iight forever!

1545
01:57:11,047 --> 01:57:14,642
Tearthe sky and break
it into pieces!

1546
01:57:14,687 --> 01:57:18,847
SIaughterthis earth and throw
it into the fIames of fire!

1547
01:57:18,847 --> 01:57:21,919
And spread your ams to sheIter me!

1548
01:57:22,687 --> 01:57:25,281
I am shattered, pIease save me!

1549
01:57:25,807 --> 01:57:27,081
I have become homeIess!

1550
01:57:27,327 --> 01:57:35,007
Give me some pIace at yourfeet!

1551
01:57:36,687 --> 01:57:41,886
PIease, give me some pIace at yourfeet!

1552
01:57:46,327 --> 01:57:49,160
The praises that I had heard
about your beauty.

1553
01:57:49,727 --> 01:57:52,480
your rebeIIion has become
more famous than that!

1554
01:57:53,607 --> 01:57:57,202
Whateverfun you have had with
your servant boyfriend..

1555
01:57:57,247 --> 01:57:58,999
I have heard everything from the peopIe.

1556
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:05,756
But then too, I considered your deeds to be
the bIack spots.. of the moon and I consented!.

1557
01:58:06,607 --> 01:58:09,405
But now with your shameIessness, I feeI as if..

1558
01:58:09,447 --> 01:58:11,961
I have married a prostitute!

1559
01:58:12,607 --> 01:58:15,644
I am not a prostitute but
you can make me one now!

1560
01:58:16,407 --> 01:58:17,237
You are a man.

1561
01:58:17,807 --> 01:58:19,479
What position does a woman
have in front of you?

1562
01:58:20,287 --> 01:58:21,242
Show your strength!

1563
01:58:21,687 --> 01:58:23,887
Destroy a stranger's property and..

1564
01:58:23,887 --> 01:58:24,876
make me a prostitute!

1565
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:26,600
Stop this nonsense!

1566
01:58:27,127 --> 01:58:29,800
You couId have toId aII this to your parents.

1567
01:58:30,407 --> 01:58:32,967
You couId have cried about it in
front of that scoundreI priest!

1568
01:58:33,007 --> 01:58:34,201
What is my fauIt in aII this?

1569
01:58:34,367 --> 01:58:35,436
I have not committed any sin!

1570
01:58:35,767 --> 01:58:38,122
You are the one who has faIIen
in Iove with someone eIse.

1571
01:58:38,367 --> 01:58:41,120
Your parents are the one who
have married you off to me.

1572
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:42,721
The priest has read the
prayers of ourwedding.

1573
01:58:42,967 --> 01:58:45,117
The Iawyers and the witnesses
have done their job.

1574
01:58:45,167 --> 01:58:48,477
Your own near and dear ones have
forced you forthis marriage.

1575
01:58:49,167 --> 01:58:50,282
I had not pIanned anything!

1576
01:58:50,687 --> 01:58:51,961
I have not taken away anyone's rights.

1577
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:54,727
Then why am I being heId responsibIe for aII this?

1578
01:58:55,207 --> 01:58:57,641
You had agreed to marry me in
spite of knowing everything.

1579
01:58:58,407 --> 01:59:01,046
If you onIy wouId have refused,
maybe this situation.. wouId have never arised!

1580
01:59:01,967 --> 01:59:04,083
You thought about yourseIf but
you didn't think about me!

1581
01:59:05,167 --> 01:59:08,239
Look, my Iove is the AImighty's wish.

1582
01:59:08,967 --> 01:59:10,923
Do not break the wish of the
AImighty by separating us!

1583
01:59:12,207 --> 01:59:13,640
I beg of you!

1584
01:59:14,607 --> 01:59:16,325
PIease hand me overto my Ranjha.

1585
01:59:16,367 --> 01:59:17,561
How do I hand you over?

1586
01:59:18,327 --> 01:59:20,921
ShouId I Iower my pride
in the entire community?

1587
01:59:21,767 --> 01:59:23,758
ShouId I maIign the name of my famiIy?

1588
01:59:24,607 --> 01:59:26,996
The same reIatives, friends,
brothers and sisters..

1589
01:59:27,207 --> 01:59:31,883
who had danced in my wedding,
wiII be suspicious.. of my manIiness!

1590
01:59:32,167 --> 01:59:33,964
The entire viIIage wiII make fun of me.

1591
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:35,725
They wiII spit on me!

1592
01:59:36,527 --> 01:59:40,600
No, no! Nothing can happen now!

1593
01:59:41,327 --> 01:59:45,206
Forget him! Considerthis aIso
as the decision of the AImighty!

1594
01:59:46,127 --> 01:59:49,324
It wiII be a compromise to Iive your Iife Iike this.

1595
01:59:50,007 --> 01:59:54,842
My decision to get married to
you was aIso a compromise.

1596
01:59:56,447 --> 01:59:59,484
And if any other need arises,
I wiII compromise again!

1597
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:02,476
But you wiII have to consider
onIy me as your husband!

1598
02:00:03,887 --> 02:00:08,324
It is my iII-fortune that your
Iove was two-sided but..

1599
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:10,999
my Iove was onIy one-sided!

1600
02:00:11,887 --> 02:00:15,880
Otherwise I wouId have never had the
strength.. to accept someone eIse's Iove!

1601
02:00:18,447 --> 02:00:24,079
'The 'bindi' of my beIoved one
is shining on my fore head. '

1602
02:00:24,607 --> 02:00:30,284
'The 'bindi' of my beIoved one
is shining on my fore head. '

1603
02:00:30,567 --> 02:00:38,759
'Bring the auspicious henna to me. '

1604
02:00:39,007 --> 02:00:41,475
'Put that henna on my hand
and Iet it become red. '

1605
02:00:42,167 --> 02:00:44,522
Sister-in-Iaw. Sister-in-Iaw.

1606
02:00:45,247 --> 02:00:46,123
Sister-in-Iaw, what happened?

1607
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:48,926
Is everything aII right?

1608
02:00:50,407 --> 02:00:53,240
Sister-in-Iaw, didn't you Iike my brother?

1609
02:00:53,687 --> 02:00:55,643
I have not Iiked this new worId.

1610
02:00:56,647 --> 02:00:58,683
For me, It is onIy mourning.

1611
02:00:59,887 --> 02:01:02,845
Pooja, go and sing the songs of happiness.

1612
02:01:03,567 --> 02:01:04,682
I have sung enough songs of happiness.

1613
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:06,486
TeII me what is the matter?

1614
02:01:07,087 --> 02:01:08,759
Did he say anything wrong?

1615
02:01:11,047 --> 02:01:13,197
When my destiny has taken such a turn..

1616
02:01:15,127 --> 02:01:18,358
it makes no difference if
anybody says anything wrong!

1617
02:01:19,767 --> 02:01:23,521
I think everything has gone wrong!

1618
02:01:24,727 --> 02:01:29,243
Is it that you have given your
heart to someone eIse and..

1619
02:01:30,327 --> 02:01:32,363
you got married to someone eIse?

1620
02:01:37,847 --> 02:01:41,078
Look sister-in-Iaw, sometimes in the dark..

1621
02:01:41,647 --> 02:01:45,765
even a smaII gIow of Iight
shows us the right direction.

1622
02:01:45,807 --> 02:01:46,523
Where did this Sethe go?

1623
02:01:46,767 --> 02:01:49,361
Has she gone to sit with her Murad?

1624
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:56,802
Who is this Murad?

1625
02:01:57,087 --> 02:01:59,317
Murad. Who is Murad?

1626
02:01:59,967 --> 02:02:03,880
You are hiding your own sorrows and
you're trying to heaI my pain?

1627
02:02:05,207 --> 02:02:09,837
Sister-in-Iaw, have you aIso
FaIIen in Iove with someone?

1628
02:02:11,767 --> 02:02:12,802
No, sister-in-Iaw, no!

1629
02:02:13,447 --> 02:02:14,482
Do not Iose hope!

1630
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:19,518
God knows, if on yourway of
no hope, maybe I wiII become

1631
02:02:19,567 --> 02:02:23,321
the smaII gIow of Iight
and show you a direction!

1632
02:02:24,647 --> 02:02:28,401
Just pray to God to take care of your Iover!

1633
02:02:28,887 --> 02:02:33,597
My every breath is praying for
his safety and is waiting for him.

1634
02:02:36,007 --> 02:02:37,440
May God be kind to him!

1635
02:02:40,047 --> 02:02:53,597
'FinaIIy, this Iove story has come to an end. '

1636
02:02:55,327 --> 02:03:01,323
'The paIanquin of Heer has gone..

1637
02:03:02,047 --> 02:03:09,965
Ranjha has become crazy. '

1638

'The worId has taken away everything from me. '

1639
02:03:31,767 --> 02:03:37,399

1641
02:03:43,607 --> 02:03:48,601
'I have to just compIain about this and go on Iiving!'

1642

'I wouId have destroyed.. ' the sun,
the moon and the stars today. '

1647
02:04:48,287 --> 02:04:53,281
'If it was possibIe.. '

1648
02:04:53,847 --> 02:04:58,841
'.. I wouId have set this worId on fire. '

1649

'My home is separated from me now. '

1661
02:06:31,607 --> 02:06:35,839
'Now I do not have any destination. '

1668
02:07:14,447 --> 02:07:21,319
'I do not want to Iive, I want to die. '

1669
02:07:30,807 --> 02:07:33,196
ChiId, who are you?

1670
02:07:34,367 --> 02:07:35,402
What probIem do you have?

1671
02:07:36,007 --> 02:07:37,725
I have Iost my God, saint.

1672
02:07:39,087 --> 02:07:40,486
My Lord is Iost.

1673
02:07:41,527 --> 02:07:44,200
Have you seen any person
who has Iost his God?

1674
02:07:45,487 --> 02:07:48,559
If you have not seen one, Iook at me!

1675
02:07:50,007 --> 02:07:55,400
No chiId, God never disappears from..
the eyes of his Ioved ones.

1676
02:07:55,927 --> 02:07:59,317
But Iike the coIor of henna, he
aIways remains.. with his Ioved ones.

1677
02:08:00,087 --> 02:08:01,679
If you feeI that he has disappeared..

1678
02:08:02,247 --> 02:08:05,478
then there is something definiteIy
Iacking in your Iove!

1679
02:08:05,767 --> 02:08:08,042
Nothing is Iacking in my Iove, saint.

1680
02:08:09,407 --> 02:08:11,637
She is within me but stiII
she is far away from me!

1681
02:08:12,567 --> 02:08:14,285
In the custody of a stranger!

1682
02:08:14,927 --> 02:08:16,155
Very farfrom my reach!

1683
02:08:17,767 --> 02:08:20,804
I am Iike a part that has been
separated from his destiny, saint.

1684
02:08:22,047 --> 02:08:24,481
Maybe the feeIing of being
united again has brought.. me back here!

1685
02:08:25,167 --> 02:08:27,806
Without her, I have Iost my identity too!

1686
02:08:29,207 --> 02:08:30,686
I want a new identity, saint.

1687
02:08:31,567 --> 02:08:35,321
Such a new identity that nobody
otherthan she.. shouId recognize me!

1688
02:08:36,647 --> 02:08:37,682
When I caII out to her

1689
02:08:38,327 --> 02:08:39,680
onIy she shouId be abIe to hear me!

1690
02:08:41,207 --> 02:08:43,437
The mystery hidden in yourtaIks is indicating

1691
02:08:44,807 --> 02:08:46,684
a woman, my chiId!

1692
02:08:47,447 --> 02:08:51,440
But wait. I wiII Iook for a
soIution for your depression..

1693
02:08:51,487 --> 02:08:54,684
and enIighten my thoughts with your queries!

1694
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:01,404
Is there anything Iacking in
my prayers or is something

1695
02:09:02,207 --> 02:09:03,560
Iacking in your hearing powers?

1696
02:09:04,887 --> 02:09:05,922
TeII me something at Ieast!

1697
02:09:07,527 --> 02:09:09,324
Have you aIso changed, my Lord?

1698
02:09:11,207 --> 02:09:13,004
How do I pray to you?

1699
02:09:13,967 --> 02:09:17,164
How do I ask you for my wish if you cannot.

1700
02:09:18,567 --> 02:09:20,523
even hear me, if my
Ranjha cannot even hear me?

1701
02:09:25,327 --> 02:09:29,286
The worIdIy affairs make our souI very weak, chiId.

1702
02:09:30,847 --> 02:09:34,123
Concentrate on the AImighty.

1703
02:09:36,247 --> 02:09:38,363
My mind is on my Heer, saint.

1704
02:09:39,447 --> 02:09:44,441
Even I want to reach God but Heer..
.. is the way to my destination.

1705
02:09:45,647 --> 02:09:48,639
She is the first step of the Iadder
which takes me to the Lord.

1706
02:09:49,487 --> 02:09:51,159
After God, she's the most
important thing in my Iife.

1707
02:09:51,527 --> 02:09:53,757
She is the first Ietter of my God's name.

1708
02:09:54,687 --> 02:09:57,281
If I wiII not get her, then what
do I have to do with the Lord?

1709
02:09:58,727 --> 02:10:01,366
God has bestowed upon you
his generous bIessings, saint.

1710
02:10:02,567 --> 02:10:05,718
PIease bestow upon me your bIessings.

1711
02:10:06,247 --> 02:10:07,282
PIease bIess me, saint.

1712
02:10:11,767 --> 02:10:13,041
Have some hope, sister-in-Iaw.

1713
02:10:14,127 --> 02:10:18,006
Even God heIps those, who heIp themseIves.

1714
02:10:19,647 --> 02:10:22,639
And destiny can change at anytime.

1715
02:10:23,407 --> 02:10:27,639
Now where had I thought that today itseIf.
I wouId get a Ietterfrom my Murad!

1716
02:10:30,767 --> 02:10:34,999
Yes. ActuaIIy, I had come to teII you that the time.

1717
02:10:36,047 --> 02:10:37,844
has come for me to go.

1718
02:10:40,407 --> 02:10:42,125
Now we both wiII have to separate.

1719
02:10:42,967 --> 02:10:45,606
I wish that if your Ranjha wouId have come.

1720
02:10:46,167 --> 02:10:48,635
we both couId have gone togetherfrom here.

1721
02:10:51,247 --> 02:10:52,202
CongratuIations!

1722
02:10:53,847 --> 02:10:56,122
I am so happy on hearing the
news that you are going..

1723
02:10:57,607 --> 02:11:01,395
but more than that, I am sad
about being aIone over here.

1724
02:11:03,207 --> 02:11:06,517
O Lord, she was my onIy hope of Iight in this darkness

1725
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:10,677
and you are taking away that
hope aIso from me today!

1726
02:11:12,487 --> 02:11:13,886
Show me a way too!

1727
02:11:14,807 --> 02:11:17,799
Show me some hidden pIace
where I can stand and.

1728
02:11:18,687 --> 02:11:20,359
caII out to my Ranjha.

1729
02:11:21,727 --> 02:11:24,958
Ranjha, where have you been?

1730
02:11:25,687 --> 02:11:26,836
Where are you?

1731
02:11:27,767 --> 02:11:32,238
Waiting for you, I am tired
and I have Iost, beIoved Ranjha.

1732
02:11:33,447 --> 02:11:35,199
I have Iost beIoved Ranjha.

1733
02:12:49,087 --> 02:12:55,526
'Today air, sand and water. '

1734
02:12:57,807 --> 02:13:05,600
'This worId is very oId. '

1735
02:13:09,887 --> 02:13:18,283
'What is the oIdest in this worId?'

1736
02:13:20,647 --> 02:13:29,123
'PeopIe say it is the stone age. '

1737
02:13:36,167 --> 02:13:42,720
'Our Iove is oIderthan that. '

1738
02:13:46,847 --> 02:13:55,198
'Come, come, come. '

1739
02:13:57,567 --> 02:14:05,281
'Come, come. '

1740
02:14:06,607 --> 02:14:09,246
'Come, come. '

1741
02:14:34,367 --> 02:14:35,322
BeIoved Ranjha.

1742
02:14:35,887 --> 02:14:40,642
'Come, come, come. '

1743
02:14:49,287 --> 02:14:50,720
BeIoved Ranjha.

1744
02:15:10,207 --> 02:15:11,879
Praise the Lord!

1745
02:15:12,847 --> 02:15:14,803
Go and beg somewhere eIse!

1746
02:15:15,287 --> 02:15:19,439
You are very strong, why do not you earn..
your IiveIihood through hard work?

1747
02:15:19,967 --> 02:15:21,958
Aren't you ashamed to beg Iike this?

1748
02:15:22,247 --> 02:15:23,521
I have not come to beg.

1749
02:15:24,327 --> 02:15:27,125
I have come to take my right. -
Are you out of your senses?

1750
02:15:27,927 --> 02:15:30,043
You are begging and on top
of that you are cIaiming..

1751
02:15:30,327 --> 02:15:34,240
for your right. -Why cannot I cIaim for my right?
AII this is God's fauIt.

1752
02:15:35,487 --> 02:15:37,398
I do not know why is he giving the share that..

1753
02:15:37,447 --> 02:15:39,324
is written in our destiny to the whoIe worId?

1754
02:15:40,447 --> 02:15:43,644
Now I am gathering the grains that.
that he has scattered in this worId!

1755
02:15:44,927 --> 02:15:47,361
I do not know in which corner of your house..

1756
02:15:47,927 --> 02:15:50,441
on which grain, my name is written?

1757
02:15:51,647 --> 02:15:52,762
I wiII take onIy that.

1758
02:15:53,447 --> 02:15:55,278
I do not want anything eIse of yours.

1759
02:15:55,527 --> 02:15:58,439
If you have so much faith in him,
then why do not you..

1760
02:15:58,647 --> 02:16:00,683
ask it from him onIy? Why
are you begging over here?

1761
02:16:00,967 --> 02:16:02,525
Even this is his wish.

1762
02:16:06,007 --> 02:16:08,396
Neither do I have faith in him nor in his wish!

1763
02:16:08,487 --> 02:16:09,761
You are very crueI.

1764
02:16:10,327 --> 02:16:11,965
To yourseIf as weII as to your Iife.

1765
02:16:12,567 --> 02:16:15,286
Nobody can stop having faith in God so easiIy.

1766
02:16:16,007 --> 02:16:18,805
You have married a person who is..
madIy in Iove with someone eIse.

1767
02:16:19,927 --> 02:16:20,837
You wiII destroy your house.

1768
02:16:21,247 --> 02:16:23,966
Change yourseIf, otherwise you
wiII be destroy yourseIf!

1769
02:16:24,367 --> 02:16:27,677
Fine. So, those scoundreI viIIagers have..

1770
02:16:27,727 --> 02:16:28,876
taught you this Iesson!

1771
02:16:29,487 --> 02:16:37,838
But teII them, that untiI morning,
if I do not douse.. the hot fire of Iove..

1772
02:16:38,407 --> 02:16:39,886
you may change my name

1773
02:16:40,567 --> 02:16:42,717
Take your aIms and get Iost from here.

1774
02:16:45,647 --> 02:16:46,397
Take this, saint.

1775
02:16:50,447 --> 02:16:55,680
This saint nevertakes aIms from that house..
where someone eIse is aIready pIeading.

1776
02:16:56,367 --> 02:16:59,165
In every part of this house, who is shedding tears?

1777
02:17:00,047 --> 02:17:02,163
In every corner, whose memories are trapped?

1778
02:17:03,127 --> 02:17:09,316
Which is this burning fire of Iove whose
fIames are reaching tiII here?

1779
02:17:10,687 --> 02:17:12,405
You stay here. I wiII come back now.

1780
02:17:16,407 --> 02:17:19,160
Sister-in-Iaw, he seems to be
a very Iearned saint. Come.

1781
02:17:23,727 --> 02:17:26,764
She is my sister-in-Iaw. She has Iost aII hopes.

1782
02:17:27,207 --> 02:17:28,083
TeII her something.

1783
02:17:34,607 --> 02:17:37,405
There is a Iong story behind her Iosing aII hope.

1784
02:17:38,447 --> 02:17:41,325
She Ioved someone but didn't get him.

1785
02:17:42,367 --> 02:17:45,723
She has taken the vows of Iiving
and dying with him, she has..

1786
02:17:45,767 --> 02:17:48,440
made many promises but she has Ieft him weeping.

1787
02:17:50,567 --> 02:17:53,923
I have Ieft everything For your Iove and..
I have become a saint, Heer.

1788
02:17:56,807 --> 02:18:01,801
My beIoved Ranjha!
My beIoved Ranjha!

1789
02:18:08,927 --> 02:18:16,515
Ranjha, without you my Iife
was Iike a curse and.. this worId was very duII.

1790
02:18:17,847 --> 02:18:20,315
But It is you
who has suffered more than I have.

1791
02:18:21,847 --> 02:18:23,599
Now take me away from here.

1792
02:18:24,367 --> 02:18:26,562
Now take me away from here, Ranjha.

1793
02:18:33,407 --> 02:18:34,760
Sethe, where are you?

1794
02:18:35,887 --> 02:18:37,718
Mother is coming.
Mother is coming.

1795
02:18:38,007 --> 02:18:38,723
Mother, I am coming.

1796
02:18:39,207 --> 02:18:42,165
Wait for us in KaIa bagh.
I wiII bring her overthere.

1797
02:18:42,487 --> 02:18:43,681
Come sister-in-Iaw, Iet's go.

1798
02:18:43,887 --> 02:18:46,082
Let's go, sister-in-Iaw.
Let's go, sister-in-Iaw.

1799
02:18:47,407 --> 02:18:48,635
I have come, mother.

1800
02:18:50,487 --> 02:18:51,715
I am deIighted!

1801
02:18:52,047 --> 02:18:55,005
Today forthe first time, I have seen a smiIe..
on my daughter-in-Iaw's face.

1802
02:18:55,527 --> 02:18:57,324
God, I thank you with aI my heart.

1803
02:18:57,367 --> 02:19:02,207
Mother, thank that saint because of whose
bIessings.. sister-in-Iaw's smiIe has come back.

1804
02:19:02,207 --> 02:19:05,597
But he has said that today, before the moon rises..

1805
02:19:05,687 --> 02:19:08,520
if sister-in-Iaw wiII go to
KaIa bagh and take his bIessings..

1806
02:19:08,967 --> 02:19:12,039
then sister-in-Iaw's smiIe wiII remain forever.

1807
02:19:12,327 --> 02:19:15,160
If by doing this, the happiness of our house..

1808
02:19:15,367 --> 02:19:16,641
can come back, then what eIse do we want?

1809
02:19:17,047 --> 02:19:18,639
You both go to him today evening itseIf.

1810
02:20:18,327 --> 02:20:22,206
Who is he? He is a Iover Iike us.

1811
02:20:22,687 --> 02:20:25,599
It is God's grace! ShaII we Ieave?

1812
02:20:26,767 --> 02:20:27,563
Wait for sometime.

1813
02:20:28,567 --> 02:20:29,283
Heer.

1814
02:20:34,527 --> 02:20:35,801
Now you both do not take any more time.

1815
02:20:36,127 --> 02:20:38,083
Go far away from here as soon as possibIe.

1816
02:20:38,127 --> 02:20:40,641
Otherwise Zaida wiII not spare anyone of us aIive.

1817
02:20:41,727 --> 02:20:48,041
The gIow of Iight which has shown me a way..
in the darkness of my Iife, I wiII never be abIe..

1818
02:20:48,367 --> 02:20:51,359
to repay your debt. Never.

1819
02:20:52,447 --> 02:20:53,926
May God be with you!
May God be with you!

1820
02:21:19,727 --> 02:21:21,160
You rascaI!

1821
02:21:21,807 --> 02:21:23,206
No, no Ranjha.

1822
02:21:26,127 --> 02:21:29,437
No.
- Get Iost. - Ranjha!

1823
02:21:32,647 --> 02:21:36,117
You rascaI! Today, I wiII break you into pieces.

1824
02:21:36,167 --> 02:21:39,557
What is going on? Why are you aII hitting him?

1825
02:21:40,447 --> 02:21:41,277
Who are you aII?

1826
02:21:41,887 --> 02:21:43,957
I am this unfortunate girI's husband.

1827
02:21:44,167 --> 02:21:46,522
No sir. My reaI husband is my Ranjha.

1828
02:21:46,567 --> 02:21:48,842
I had married this shameIess woman.

1829
02:21:48,887 --> 02:21:52,243
That marriage was invaIid. You
rascaI! I wiII.. - Shut up!

1830
02:21:52,807 --> 02:21:54,684
Who is right and who is wrong among you both..

1831
02:21:54,927 --> 02:21:58,124
wiII not be decided over here,
but in the court of our king.

1832
02:22:00,287 --> 02:22:03,882
So, one side there is marriage
and on the other side.. there is Iove.

1833
02:22:04,487 --> 02:22:05,681
That means on one side there is society and

1834
02:22:06,487 --> 02:22:08,125
on the other side there is rebeIIion.

1835
02:22:08,407 --> 02:22:09,726
On one side there are the worIdIy affairs and..

1836
02:22:10,567 --> 02:22:12,046
on the other side, there is personaI matter.

1837
02:22:13,487 --> 02:22:16,047
The matter is cIeared to quite an extent.

1838
02:22:16,487 --> 02:22:18,717
But then too, before I make any decision..

1839
02:22:18,767 --> 02:22:24,160
if any of you, want to further investigate this matter..

1840
02:22:25,167 --> 02:22:26,885
then you have my permission.

1841
02:22:27,007 --> 02:22:30,886
Respected king, this man is a
demon in disguise of a saint.

1842
02:22:31,407 --> 02:22:33,398
He is a disgrace on the cIan of saints.

1843
02:22:33,447 --> 02:22:35,403
He is the sinner of both the worIds!

1844
02:22:36,047 --> 02:22:38,117
If he does not get punished for his sins..

1845
02:22:38,687 --> 02:22:40,723
peopIe wiII Iose theirfaith in justice!

1846
02:22:41,007 --> 02:22:46,718
By shouting, a Iie cannot become a truth..
and a truth cannot become a Iie, Zaida.

1847
02:22:47,167 --> 02:22:48,759
The truth is the truth and a Iie is a Iie!

1848
02:22:49,887 --> 02:22:51,036
The difference is onIy this much, King..

1849
02:22:51,327 --> 02:22:53,921
that nobody couId bearthe truth of our Iove!

1850
02:22:54,127 --> 02:22:55,526
And peopIe supported his faIse marriage..

1851
02:22:55,727 --> 02:22:57,797
underthe guise of customs!

1852
02:22:58,687 --> 02:23:01,281
If today, it is a sin for Heer and me to eIope

1853
02:23:01,607 --> 02:23:05,759
and in spite of knowing about our Iove,
he married Heer! Wasn't that a sin?

1854
02:23:07,087 --> 02:23:10,045
In this worId, aII those things
which are different from the worId..

1855
02:23:10,327 --> 02:23:11,885
which is against the ruIes of this worId.

1856
02:23:12,167 --> 02:23:14,522
I wouId Iike to ask you why
cannot two hearts meet.

1857
02:23:14,927 --> 02:23:17,646
two bodies meet, two worIds
meet with their own wish..

1858
02:23:17,927 --> 02:23:19,326
with their happiness and with their own desire?

1859
02:23:19,727 --> 02:23:22,195
Why does it aIways require the stub of customs

1860
02:23:22,247 --> 02:23:23,521
the permission of the community and

1861
02:23:23,567 --> 02:23:25,285
the seaI of the priest? Why?

1862
02:23:25,527 --> 02:23:26,880
I wiII teII you, young man.

1863
02:23:29,127 --> 02:23:31,163
Greetings to the great King!

1864
02:23:32,007 --> 02:23:36,558
I am that priest, king, who had read the prayers..
in Zaida's wedding with Heer.

1865
02:23:37,927 --> 02:23:40,316
Keeping aII the aspects of customs in mind..

1866
02:23:40,367 --> 02:23:43,803
and in the presence of witnesses, this wedding
had taken pIace, King.

1867
02:23:44,327 --> 02:23:47,444
And now, Zaida is the reaI husband of Heer.

1868
02:23:48,647 --> 02:23:51,923
I wouId not Iike to speak much but I wouId Iike to say..

1869
02:23:52,487 --> 02:23:54,443
onIy this much that this man is a traitor.

1870
02:23:55,207 --> 02:23:59,120
To be a traitor is a sin in itseIf, king.

1871
02:23:59,567 --> 02:24:02,923
But he has gone against the customs and he has..

1872
02:24:02,967 --> 02:24:06,516
committed one more sin by
trying to break the customs.

1873
02:24:06,647 --> 02:24:08,842
I wouId Iike to ask the
authoritarian of the customs..

1874
02:24:08,887 --> 02:24:13,199
.. king, that whatever he has
done with us, wasn't it a sin?

1875
02:24:13,687 --> 02:24:18,363
He took a bribe and against my wiII, he handed me.
overto an unknown man! Wasn't that a crime?

1876
02:24:18,607 --> 02:24:20,404
And the biggest crime he has
done is that I was pIeading..

1877
02:24:20,607 --> 02:24:26,398
and he took a bribe and announced my approvaI.

1878
02:24:26,887 --> 02:24:32,041
It is a shame! She has insuIted
me! Such a big insuIt..

1879
02:24:32,447 --> 02:24:33,562
such a big bIame!

1880
02:24:33,927 --> 02:24:37,886
King, you wiII get the proof that this girI is Iying..

1881
02:24:37,927 --> 02:24:44,685
from the testimony of herfamiIy members..
in front of whom I had read the prayers for herwedding.

1882
02:24:44,727 --> 02:24:46,160
And she had agreed.

1883
02:24:46,487 --> 02:24:47,283
Not at aII!

1884
02:24:50,247 --> 02:24:52,078
First, bring the witnesses.

1885
02:24:52,127 --> 02:24:55,199
My first witness is Kedo Chaudhary, king..

1886
02:24:55,567 --> 02:24:58,161
who is this girI's uncIe. - Emperor.

1887
02:25:03,927 --> 02:25:09,240
Had this girI agreed to marry Zaida
out of free wiII.. in front of you?

1888
02:25:09,887 --> 02:25:11,002
Yes, emperor.

1889
02:25:11,207 --> 02:25:12,481
No, It is a Iie!

1890
02:25:15,247 --> 02:25:17,920
I am surprised that how did
she take this wrong step?

1891
02:25:18,607 --> 02:25:20,279
Emperor, if she wasn't happy with this reIationship..

1892
02:25:20,487 --> 02:25:21,761
then she couId have refused at that time.

1893
02:25:24,287 --> 02:25:25,686
Let the second witness be caIIed!

1894
02:25:25,767 --> 02:25:28,486
The second witness is SuItan Chaudhary..

1895
02:25:28,527 --> 02:25:30,404
who is this girI's brother.

1896
02:25:32,287 --> 02:25:35,324
Had this girI agreed forthe wedding in front of you?

1897
02:25:42,247 --> 02:25:43,157
TeII me.

1898
02:25:43,287 --> 02:25:46,723
Respected king, with your
Permission, I wouId Iike..

1899
02:25:47,207 --> 02:25:49,402
to teII my brother onIy this much that before saying.

1900
02:25:51,767 --> 02:25:55,999
.anything, do Iisten
to the voice of your conscience!

1901
02:25:57,487 --> 02:26:00,399
And do Iook into your
sister's eyes at Ieast once!

1902
02:26:01,647 --> 02:26:03,922
Because it is not the question
of saying yes or no or..

1903
02:26:03,967 --> 02:26:05,116
of the truth but it is the question of our..

1904
02:26:06,567 --> 02:26:08,080
brother-sister reIationship too!

1905
02:26:08,887 --> 02:26:10,639
Of a sister's trust on her brother.

1906
02:26:12,247 --> 02:26:17,446
If this trust is broken today, this reIationship..
of a brother and a sisterwiII end forever!

1907
02:26:19,207 --> 02:26:21,516
I remind you that we are reIated by bIood!

1908
02:26:24,047 --> 02:26:28,086
Whatever is the truth, say onIy that.

1909
02:26:28,407 --> 02:26:34,039
Look king, in front of you this guiIty
girI is trying to.. misIead her brother.

1910
02:26:34,767 --> 02:26:38,521
She is cajoIing him..
coaxing him to Iie and I do not know..

1911
02:26:38,567 --> 02:26:42,606
No, emperor! She was stopping me from Iying!

1912
02:26:43,767 --> 02:26:46,884
Yes, emperor. She is teIIing me to speak the truth.

1913
02:26:48,527 --> 02:26:53,521
The truth is this, king, that we
had got her married herforcefuIIy.

1914
02:26:55,167 --> 02:26:56,964
Now, even God wiII not forgive us!

1915
02:26:59,087 --> 02:27:00,486
God wiII not forgive us!

1916
02:27:11,447 --> 02:27:13,199
WiII you Iike to say anything more?

1917
02:27:15,847 --> 02:27:19,840
Emperor, if on seeing tears in this girI's eyes..

1918
02:27:20,447 --> 02:27:23,678
a brother has changed his
testimony, what can be done?

1919
02:27:24,007 --> 02:27:26,362
Kedo is there. I am there.

1920
02:27:27,367 --> 02:27:29,198
The entire community is the
witness of this wedding.

1921
02:27:30,047 --> 02:27:34,086
No power in this worId can prove this truth to be faIse..

1922
02:27:34,367 --> 02:27:36,881
that Heer had been married to Zaida.

1923
02:27:38,447 --> 02:27:43,157
If Iike him, even I begin making the truth,a Iie..

1924
02:27:43,207 --> 02:27:49,316
and a Iie, the truth, reIigion wiII become..
a joke for everyone!

1925
02:27:49,807 --> 02:27:55,120
In every house, every daughter-in-Iaw and..
daughters wiII start faIIing in Iove, emperor.

1926
02:27:56,167 --> 02:27:57,759
Have you everfaIIen in Iove?

1927
02:27:58,167 --> 02:28:03,082
What? I did not understand
emperor.

1928
02:28:03,127 --> 02:28:07,803
I want to know whether you have been in Iove anytime.

1929
02:28:08,207 --> 02:28:12,803
No emperor. How can I faII in Iove?

1930
02:28:13,327 --> 02:28:15,636
Why? Aren't you a human being?

1931
02:28:16,407 --> 02:28:21,435
Yes, I am a human being but
I have neverfaIIen in Iove.

1932
02:28:21,647 --> 02:28:23,000
Not even with the AImighty God.

1933
02:28:23,447 --> 02:28:25,722
What?! With the AImighty God?

1934
02:28:27,087 --> 02:28:29,920
Yes emperor, I have faIIen in Iove with God.

1935
02:28:29,967 --> 02:28:32,527
So then, did you meet God?

1936
02:28:32,927 --> 02:28:36,602
I think, emperorthat maybe I had met God.

1937
02:28:37,007 --> 02:28:39,441
I do not Iike confusing words, Iike maybe.

1938
02:28:39,807 --> 02:28:41,445
Did you meet God or no?

1939
02:28:41,807 --> 02:28:43,160
Give me an answer in yes or no.

1940
02:28:43,727 --> 02:28:46,002
Yes, I met God, emperor.

1941
02:28:48,327 --> 02:28:51,125
Does anybody eIse know that you have met God?

1942
02:28:52,287 --> 02:28:54,721
After aII, God is God emperor.

1943
02:28:55,287 --> 02:28:58,245
I have met him, how can somebody eIse know about it?

1944
02:28:59,527 --> 02:29:00,323
It is amazing!

1945
02:29:01,807 --> 02:29:05,641
It is said that when Iovers meet, at that time itseIf..

1946
02:29:05,687 --> 02:29:07,200
the whoIe worId comes to know.

1947
02:29:09,487 --> 02:29:12,320
When they both met, the entire
worId came to know about it.

1948
02:29:13,607 --> 02:29:17,805
And you met God and nobody
came to know about it.

1949
02:29:18,207 --> 02:29:22,758
I.. What do I know emperor?

1950
02:29:23,167 --> 02:29:26,318
God onIy knows about his actions.

1951
02:29:26,367 --> 02:29:28,447
Then God must be knowing this aIso that you are..

1952
02:29:28,447 --> 02:29:32,486
teIIing many Iies to hide one Iie.

1953
02:29:32,967 --> 02:29:35,117
Forgive me, emperor.

1954
02:29:35,167 --> 02:29:36,316
Forgive me.

1955
02:29:36,887 --> 02:29:42,519
I was making a futiIe effort to prove
my Iie to be the truth.. Iike this faIse wedding.

1956
02:29:43,287 --> 02:29:45,801
I am the cuIprit of both the worIds.

1957
02:29:45,847 --> 02:29:48,407
Forgive me, emperor.

1958
02:29:49,247 --> 02:29:52,637
PIease spare me.
PIease spare me.

1959
02:29:54,687 --> 02:29:55,802
Forgive me, emperor.

1960
02:30:01,847 --> 02:30:04,486
I am sorry that instead of showing the right path..

1961
02:30:04,527 --> 02:30:06,757
to peopIe, you are on the wrong path yourseIf.

1962
02:30:07,847 --> 02:30:10,520
I do not even have the right to forgive you.

1963
02:30:11,647 --> 02:30:13,717
These innocent peopIe have the right.

1964
02:30:15,327 --> 02:30:18,000
If you wouId have understood their Iove..

1965
02:30:18,567 --> 02:30:21,365
even you wouId have got the way to God AImighty.

1966
02:30:22,687 --> 02:30:29,798
This is the speciaIty of true Love, that sometimes it makes..
a human being feeI Iike God and sometimes it makes..

1967
02:30:29,847 --> 02:30:30,996
a human being confront God himseIf.

1968
02:30:33,607 --> 02:30:35,882
Such hoIy peopIe come down..

1969
02:30:35,927 --> 02:30:38,157
on the earth onIy sometimes.

1970
02:30:39,487 --> 02:30:42,479
We aII shouId together unite them.

1971
02:31:10,847 --> 02:31:28,482
'O my dear, your groom is here, he is come to take you. '

1972
02:31:29,127 --> 02:31:40,595
'He has come aIong with the procession..
he has come to take you. '

1973
02:31:41,327 --> 02:31:52,602
'O my dear, your groom is here, he is come to take you. '

1974
02:31:53,567 --> 02:32:01,838
'O my dear, your groom is here, he is come to take you. '

1975
02:32:07,207 --> 02:32:12,235
If God is so proud of his Iove, then today I wiII break it.

1976
02:32:14,247 --> 02:32:15,521
These pots, these ceIebrations..

1977
02:32:15,567 --> 02:32:18,240
this sound of music, I wiII cover it with such..

1978
02:32:18,287 --> 02:32:27,400
a veiI of mourning that there wiII be no more sounds here!

1979
02:32:32,487 --> 02:32:36,082
You aII go and as soon as I sit near Heer..

1980
02:32:36,687 --> 02:32:38,200
bring the pIate of sweets.

1981
02:32:38,687 --> 02:32:40,564
We are compIeteIy prepared,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1982
02:32:40,607 --> 02:32:44,680
Pick up that sweet which has a siIver covering and..

1983
02:32:44,727 --> 02:32:46,080
.it wiII be kept on the top of aII the sweets on my pIate.

1984
02:32:47,167 --> 02:32:49,078
The procession is here. I wiII Ieave now.

1985
02:32:56,327 --> 02:33:04,803
'O my dear, your groom is here, he is come to take you. '

1986
02:33:08,967 --> 02:33:09,922
What is the matter, uncIe?

1987
02:33:10,807 --> 02:33:13,082
Are you stiII not happy with my happiness?

1988
02:33:14,567 --> 02:33:20,483
How can I be happy untiI you do not forgive me?

1989
02:33:21,327 --> 02:33:22,362
What are you asking forgiveness For, uncIe?

1990
02:33:23,167 --> 02:33:24,805
This was the fight of our own principIes.

1991
02:33:25,807 --> 02:33:27,525
My principIes are kiIIing me.

1992
02:33:28,687 --> 02:33:32,282
I wiII not get peace untiI you forgive me.

1993

PIease do not embarrass me.

1997
02:33:38,687 --> 02:33:41,520
I had forgotten aII the grudges at that time itsIef..

1998
02:33:41,567 --> 02:33:44,365
when it was decided to hand me overto my Ranjha.

You have given me a new Iife.

2002
02:33:56,047 --> 02:33:57,400
I wiII eat sugar and die.

2003
02:33:57,447 --> 02:33:59,563
Why wiII you die after eating sugar?

2004
02:34:00,447 --> 02:34:02,756
I wiII teII you after you've eaten the sweet.

2005
02:34:02,807 --> 02:34:03,717
Yes, why not?

2006
02:34:03,767 --> 02:34:06,918
It is a different fun in dying after eating sweets. -Yes.

02:34:06,967 --> 02:34:07,877
Give it here.

2008

But teII us first that who has sent these sweets?

The peopIe from Takhttazaara have sent these..
.sweets to give to our bride.

2010
02:34:16,527 --> 02:34:20,236
Then the first person to taste them shouId be our daughter.

Something is happening to me, mother.

2027
02:35:51,287 --> 02:35:52,197

2028
02:35:52,247 --> 02:35:55,398
But what happened? Kedo has
given her something to eat. -What?

O God, take me but save my chiId.

2033
02:36:07,207 --> 02:36:12,440
Mother.
- Heer! Heer, my daughter!

2034
02:36:12,847 --> 02:36:13,962
What is wrong with her?

2035
02:36:14,007 --> 02:36:16,123
Kedo has given her something to eat.

2036
02:36:16,767 --> 02:36:18,086

Ranjha, go and see Heer quickIy.

2045
02:36:47,767 --> 02:36:50,406
Kedo has given poison to her.

2046
02:36:50,687 --> 02:36:51,676
Your Heer is gone.

2047
02:36:52,407 --> 02:36:54,796
No SuItan, this cannot happen.

2048
02:36:55,247 --> 02:36:56,566
This cannot happen.

2049
02:37:21,087 --> 02:37:26,002
Heer! Heer! Heer!

2050
02:37:34,887 --> 02:37:37,560
Ranjha! -Yes Heer!

I think, saint has made our game of hide and seek..

2052
02:37:45,047 --> 02:37:48,835
which we used to pIay in our chiIdhood, come true.

2053
02:37:50,967 --> 02:37:52,764
But you find me, okay.

2054
02:37:57,287 --> 02:38:00,996
I wiII wait for you.

2055
02:38:10,607 --> 02:38:15,476
Heer!

'Those fIowers couId not bIoom over here. '

'Those fIowers wiII bIoom overthere. '

2058
02:39:27,847 --> 02:39:35,435
'We couId not meet in this worId. '

2059
02:39:36,647 --> 02:39:45,521
'We wiII meet in that worId. '

2060
02:39:48,367 --> 02:40:03,442
'The AImighty has written..
the destiny of Iove. '

2061
02:40:06,287 --> 02:40:14,558
'These five rivers have cried a Iot and then..

2062
02:40:14,607 --> 02:40:25,677
