 "Different kinds of work"

38
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,083
 What are you doing?

39
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,666
 Drive more cautiously!

40
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,750
Madam, this is how you're supposed to drive in Delhi.

41
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,125
But are you driving or playing a videogame?

42
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,083
 You turn randomly, wherever you like!

43
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,375
Look madam, this is the only way I know to drive.

44
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:31,166
If you know any better, why don't you take the wheel?

45
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,916
 Park the auto on the side.

46
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,875
 What happened madam?

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,041
 Do as I say, this very instant!

48
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,041
 But what's the matter, madam!?

49
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,125
 Come on the back seat.

50
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,083
 I'll show you how to drive.

51
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,791
 You took offence!!

52
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,041
 That's not what I meant...

53
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,875
Really. You want to learn how to drive, right?

54
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,583
 I'll teach you.

55
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,666
The police station is not very far from here.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,708
I'll very easily give you a demonstration up till there!

57
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,916
Sorry madam! I committed a huge mistake.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,791
 I drive someone else's auto.

59
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,250
 My job will be in peril.

60
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,125
I know how to set people like you right.

61
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,583
 Come to the police station.

62
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,416
 Madam, I have small kids.

63
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,458
I swear I will never repeat such a thing in my life!

64
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,750
So then learn to drive like a responsible driver.

65
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,708
And listen, while talking to a girl, look into her eyes! Understood!

66
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,416
Lets go. - Thank you madam.

67
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,333
Hi. - Hi.

68
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,125
 You're back from the office so early!?

69
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,041
 I left my job.

70
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,666
 What!?

71
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,541
 But why?

72
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,791
No Tanny, I'm really worried about you.

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,333
Look at your CV! If this frequency were to continue..

74
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,166
 ..you'll not get a job anywhere.

75
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,750
So should I also become a model like you?

76
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,333
I've been telling you that since so long!

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,583
I'll introduce you to photographers, coordinators.

78
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,625
 You'll love it. It's so much fun!

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,583
 Exactly! Work should always be fun.

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,833
You enjoy modelling because it's your passion.

81
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,375
I guess, even I will keep looking till..

82
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,833
 ..I find my passion, my ideal job.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,916
 I've known you for a year.

84
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,125
But I still haven't understood what your ideal job is!

85
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,291
See, ultimately my goal is to start an adventure travel company...

86
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,000
 ...in my parents' name in Chandigarh.

87
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,166
But for that, I need money which I don't have!

88
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,583
So till the time I collect some savings...

89
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,375
...I guess, my ideal job is something unique...

90
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,833
...one that gives me a new adventure every day...

91
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,791
 ...a new challenge, you know!

92
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,416
 So basically your ideal job..

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,375
..should be challenging and different, right?

94
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,250
Absolutely! Being different is paramount.

95
00:05:54,583 --> 00:06:00,625
In that case, I think I've found your ideal job!

96
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,791
Really! - Have a look!

97
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,625
What!? - Why, what happened!!

98
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,791
Doesn't it list all the qualities that you want in your ideal job?

99
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,083
 Are you serious?

100
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:21,958
You know, the moment I read this ad, I thought about you.

101
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,333
You love cars so much, especially SUVs.

102
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,583
And, oh yes, you're blessed with an adventurous spirit!

103
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,125
I think you're going to make a great driver.

104
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,541
 You're making fun of me!?

105
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,333
 No Tanny, I'm absolutely serious.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,375
 It's very easy to talk.

107
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,333
 But very difficult to act.

108
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,583
And if you truly do want to do something different in life...

109
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,500
 ...then I don't think you'll get..

110
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,791
..a more different opportunity than this!

111
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,291
 Are you challenging me?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,208
Going by the ad, I don't think it gets any more challenging than this!

113
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,875
 Okay then.

114
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,750
Now I'll show you Tanya's adventurous spirit!

115
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,875
 We shall see!

116
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,458
 Stop right here! What's the fare?

117
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,833
 Sixty rupees.

118
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:24,208
 What's this damsel doing here?

119
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,791
Has she forgotten the way to the beauty parlor or what!

120
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,750
 'Tanya, have you gone mad?'

121
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,750
'What are you doing amidst these monsters?'

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,041
 'Leave this very moment.'

123
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,250
 'Yeah right, Tanya, leave!'

124
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,916
'You always take the easy route anyways.'

125
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,875
 'It's very easy to talk.'

126
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,875
 'But very difficult to act.'

127
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,666
'We'll see when you actually do something different in life.'

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,375
 "Let's do something unique"

129
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,458
 "This or that"

130
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,000
 "Different kinds of work"

131
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,750
 "Boy is making food"

132
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,541
 "Girl is having fun"

133
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
 "Both have talent"

134
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,083
 "And equal renown"

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,750
 "Different kinds of work"

136
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,250
 "Different kinds of work"

137
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,791
 Yes madam, how may I help you?

138
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,541
 I've come here for the interview.

139
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
See madam, this queue is not for Miss India!

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,041
 This line is for a driver's job!

141
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,875
I've come here for the driver's job interview.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
Why are you joking so early in the morning!

143
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,958
Here's my CV. Please give it to Mr Kapoor.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,125
CV? - She has brought CV.

145
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,000
 Are you serious?

146
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,500
All right then. Please wait here. I'll be right back!

147
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,041
 Please be in the queue.

148
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,375
 This is not a cinema show going on!

149
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,416
I have 26 years of driving 'inexperience''!

150
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,583
From a bullock cart to a Bentley, I've driven it all!

151
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,583
And till date I've been involved in only two and a half 'askidents'!

152
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,583
Two and a half!? - Twice there was a collision with other cars.

153
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,666
 And once, I rammed into a pole...

154
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,333
Now since there was no second party involved..

155
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,000
 ..we can't call it a full 'askident'!

156
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,166
 It'll be counted as half only, right!

157
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,416
But the car wasn't much damaged, and as for the loss of life,

158
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,791
I'm standing intact in front of you! Ha ha ha!

159
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,666
 You've got lovely 'inexperience'!

160
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,916
We'll let you know in a day or two. - Yes.

161
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,708
 Sir tomorrow's Friday.

162
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,916
It's my fasting day when I abstain from all speech.

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,791
It'll be best if you let me know on Saturday.

164
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,958
 I'm absolutely active on Saturday.

165
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,625
Perfect! We'll call you on Saturday then.

166
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,958
 Mention not, Sir!

167
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
What sort of morons are coming since morning!

168
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,958
I'd thought that, after reading this sensational ad,..

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,291
..there will be a jamboree of MBAs lined up outside.

170
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,875
 But leave aside MBAs or graduates...

171
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,708
...not even a single high-school pass out has showed up till now!

172
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,000
Where will we find a driver for this Undertaker?

173
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,958
 You know how finicky my grandson is!

174
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,958
 Sir, Tanya madam has come.

175
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,375
Gosh, now these credit card people have started..

176
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,583
 ..showing up at home too!

177
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,333
No no. She's come for the driver's job interview.

178
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,500
 What!?

179
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,291
All right. Send her inside. - Yes sir.

180
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,291
 Please come with me.

181
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,208
This is not fair! We've been in the queue since morning!

182
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,041
 Good Morning. I'm Tanya.

183
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,833
 Good morning.

184
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,333
Please have a seat. - Hi. - Hi.

185
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:50,041
Mango was saying that you've come here for the job interview! - Yes.

186
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,416
See this interview is not for a white-collar job.

187
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,041
 It is for a driver's job!

188
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,500
 As far as I remember..

189
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,750
..you hadn't advertised for a sales or marketing job!

190
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,916
Please excuse us for being so surprised!

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,416
Actually we hadn't expected a girl to apply for this job!

192
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,125
 Pardon my saying this sir,..

193
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,916
..but don't you think that's a little hypocritical!

194
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,000
In this day and age when a man can be a make-up artist...

195
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,666
 ...why can't a woman be a driver?

196
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,666
According to me, if women can become astronauts...

197
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,958
...I'm sure they can become drivers too!

198
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,583
 And, statistically speaking...

199
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,875
 ...in comparison to male drivers..

200
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,458
..female drivers are involved in 37.58 percent less accidents!

201
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,625
 So I've read somewhere.

202
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:38,916
Honestly Tanya, I don't doubt your or other girls' capability.

203
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,625
Besides, I've reviewed your CV. It's very impressive!

204
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:50,125
But despite being so qualified, why do you want to do this job!?

205
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,916
There are two reasons for that: Firstly, I love SUVs!

206
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,666
When I read that I'll get a chance to drive one,..

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,500
 ..I didn't need further incentive.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,375
And secondly, some people think that I can't do this job...

209
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,250
...and I have a point to prove to them!

210
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,500
 Perfect!

211
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,250
Then you are absolutely ideal for this job!

212
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,125
 But one quick question...

213
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,416
 ...can you drive!

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,458
 "Let me take you for a ride"

215
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,333
 "On the other side"

216
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,416
 "I can show you the whole world"

217
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,875
 "Baby if you like"

218
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,666
 "GD drivin' in Bombay"

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,500
 "Every single night and every morning"

220
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,541
 "Girl dynamite driver"

221
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,541
 "A knockout of a driver"

222
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,541
 "India's first female chauffeur"

223
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,458
 "A truly smashing chauffeur"

224
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
 "Girl dynamite driver"

225
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,416
 "A knockout of a driver"

226
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,458
 "India's first female chauffeur"

227
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,250
 "A truly smashing chauffeur"

228
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,041
 "Prancing around!"

229
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,000
 "Prancing around!"

230
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:54,875
 "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!"

231
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,833
 Very impressive Tanya!

232
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,625
Very impressive! - Thank you Sir.

233
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,500
 Consider this job yours...

234
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,583
 There are just two small conditions.

235
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,916
 And what are those?

236
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,875
Firstly, you have to address me as Grandpa, not Sir.

237
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,166
Okay. - And secondly, very important...

238
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,541
...you will have to sign a contract ...

239
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,375
...that you will not leave this job before six months.

240
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,875
 Are you okay with that!

241
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,583
 You're trapped, Tanya!

242
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,500
You'd thought that you'd take this job..

243
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,916
..prove your point for a few days and then move on.

244
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,625
 But this has backfired!

245
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,458
Tanya, I know this is an unusual situation...

246
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,875
...that's why I'll give you an unusual offer.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,625
Your salary would be Rs 50,000 per month, plus perks and allowances.

248
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,916
And if you complete the stipulated six months...

249
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:59,000
...then I'll give you six months' salary as bonus.

250
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,500
After that, if you wish, you can continue...

251
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,000
...or else you can do whatever you want with that money.

252
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,625
You can study further, you can invest...

253
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,166
 ...whatever you wish to do!

254
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,541
 I accept.

255
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,791
 Excellent!

256
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,041
I'll send Mango to your place tomorrow.

257
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:28,041
He'll give you the contract and take you to the designer.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,625
 Get a uniform as per your liking.

259
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,708
 Okay Grandpa. Thank you.

260
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,583
Okay. - Bye. - Bye.

261
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,500
It was mentioned in the ad that the driver should be..

262
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,333
 ..comfortable with silence!?

263
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,875
Actually Arjun his grandson, and my friend..

264
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,416
..who you basically have to work with...

265
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,166
 ...likes to meditate in the car...

266
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,583
 ...he abstains from speech sometimes.

267
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,333
 Otherwise, he's very chilled out!

268
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,541
Okay. - You'll quite enjoy working with him!

269
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,083
All the best! - Thank you!

270
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,541
 God bless you Tanya.

271
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,708
 Bye.

272
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,666
 Grandpa, if I knew that..

273
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,333
..you'd be offering this kind of a pay package and perks...

274
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,000
...then I'd have gladly become Arjun's driver!

275
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:16,541
I know this salary is a little high for this kind of work.

276
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,166
 But it's not about money Sam!

277
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,041
This is the first time I've found someone of Arjun's calibre.

278
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,000
 My heart tells me that this girl..

279
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,375
..will bring about a positive change in Arjun's life.

280
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,041
 He'll become a better human being.

281
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,666
 And that's exactly what I want!

282
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,125
 To accomplish that..

283
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,125
..even if I have to put in a few hundred thousand rupees..

284
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,875
 ..it doesn't matter.

285
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,500
 And what about your bet!

286
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,958
 Don't you want to win!?

287
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:51,750
 A wise person once said:

288
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,958
If you get what you desire it's good...

289
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,041
 ...and if you don't, it's even better!

290
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,791
Regardless of whether I win this bet or Arjun..

291
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,875
 ..we both stand to benefit!

292
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,291
 You just wait and watch!

293
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,708
 So Grandpa, any luck?

294
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,250
In what? - In finding a driver for me!

295
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,875
 Yes, I've found one.

296
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,000
 Exactly what you were looking for!

297
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,666
 Tanveer Tokas.

298
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,708
 Six feet and six pack.

299
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,458
 BA honours.

300
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,541
 Drives like a dream.

301
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,375
 But there's a slight problem.

302
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,541
 He's got a thick beard.

303
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,375
And I think he's a little touchy about his facial hair.

304
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,750
 Seems he won't cut it.

305
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,666
Nothing doing, Grandpa! This will not work.

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,833
The driver being clean-shaven is also one of the conditions.

307
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,625
I completely forgot to mention that to Sam!

308
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,541
 When is this Tokas guy joining from?

309
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,916
 Tomorrow morning.

310
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,083
 Why don't you talk to him yourself?

311
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,333
But Grandpa! Tanya madam.. Mango you keep quiet!

312
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,916
One, you don't know how to drive, and then you have such a loud mouth!

313
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:10,833
So son, did you meet any interesting babe while you were in New York?

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
 I'd gone to New York for a conference!

315
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,250
 Don't girls attend a conference?

316
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,000
 God you're so boring!

317
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,166
 Where's this Tokas chap of yours?

318
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,708
 Must be on the way!

319
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,166
Grandpa, you know I can't tolerate unpunctuality!

320
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,458
If this is his attitude the very first day, what will he do later!

321
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,583
 He comes from far-off Gurgaon.

322
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,791
 Must have hit traffic.

323
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,333
In a few minutes I'm sure... There he is!

324
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,166
Sorry, Grandpa. There was a lot of traffic in route.

325
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,208
 It's all right.

326
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,208
 We were just relaxing.

327
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,708
Oh, I completely forgot to introduce the two of you!

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Arjun, this is Tanya, our new team member...

329
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:56,833
...and Tanya, this is Arjun, the apple of my eye.

330
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
Good Morning. - Morning!

331
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,083
Grandpa, could I have a minute with you, please!

332
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,750
 I think he got a little shy.

333
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,041
 He's very bashful, you know!

334
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,583
 Please get the car to the porch..

335
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,750
..and we'll join you in a couple of minutes.

336
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,000
 Sure Grandpa.

337
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,416
 So champion!

338
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,541
 How did you like Tanveer Tokas!?

339
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,416
 Grandpa, what's this?

340
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,333
You only had said yesterday that the driver should be clean-shaven!

341
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,583
 I didn't look at her that closely..

342
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,541
..but I don't think she has facial hair!

343
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,916
 O c'mon, Grandpa!

344
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,166
I'd asked you to find me a driver, not a doll!

345
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,916
From which angle does she look like a driver?

346
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,666
And what kind of uniform is she wearing!?

347
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,583
You'd said that you want a uniformed driver..

348
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,750
..but you hadn't specified what kind of uniform it should be!

349
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,375
I personally think she looks every bit a driver in this uniform!

350
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,583
Have you ever heard about anyone's female driver?

351
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,375
 What's the big deal about it!

352
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,416
Out on the roads, every second or third car is driven by a girl.

353
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,791
The only difference here is that she's not driving her own car..

354
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,500
 ..but yours! Simple!

355
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,916
And by the way, statistically speaking...

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,333
...female drivers are involved in 37.58 percent less accidents..

357
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,750
 ..compared to male drivers!

358
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,500
 What!?

359
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,750
 I've read that somewhere.

360
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,791
Grandpa, I think she's too delicate for this job!

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,916
 Please find me another driver!

362
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
 All right, I'll say no to her.

363
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:28,291
First you accept that you have lost the bet! - What!?

364
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,041
You'd asked me to find you a driver of my choice...

365
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,916
...and promised that you'll keep that driver for 6 months!

366
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,666
 My choice is very obviously this girl!

367
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,916
 Now you decide what you want to do.

368
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,416
 Grandpa, this is blackmail!

369
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:45,000
All over the world, countless people lose a bet every day.

370
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,708
Your name will also be included in that..

371
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,708
...what's the big deal in that? You don't worry..

372
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,208
..I'll just go and politely send her back.

373
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,500
 Wait, Grandpa!

374
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,666
 If she's your final choice..

375
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,833
..then I'll keep her as my driver for six months.

376
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,541
But our bet was that I will not fire the driver.

377
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,708
But if the driver wants to leave of her own accord..

378
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,166
 ..then I am not responsible!

379
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,416
 By all means, try your luck my boy!

380
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,583
 Go and try!

381
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,750
 Turn the car around.

382
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,375
 I like to sit on the other side.

383
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,125
Okay. - "Let's go driver."

384
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,000
But I think today I'm going to sit on the other side.

385
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,125
 Okay.

386
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,875
All the best, Krishanji! - Krishanji!?

387
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:10,541
In Mahabharat, Krishanji was Arjun's driver, his vanguard, you know!

388
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,875
 Haven't you seen the TV serial?

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,166
 Let's go!

390
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,250
 "Let's go driver."

391
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,000
"Let me take you on a ride on the other side. - Let's go driver."

392
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,000
"Let me show you the whole world if you like."

393
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,541
 "Let's go driver!"

394
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,500
 Switch off the music.

395
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,750
 Should I lower the volume?

396
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,333
 No, just switch off the music.

397
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,750
 I don't like noise in the car!

398
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,583
 And I like the AC temperature at 18.5.

399
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,250
 Please keep it constant at that.

400
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,833
 Neither less nor more!

401
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,750
I like my car to be driven at a particular speed.

402
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,708
On the expressway, I like 65, close to my house 55...

403
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,333
...near the office 45, and close to the construction site 35...

404
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,000
...on Delhi roads 25, and in busy areas only 5.

405
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,041
These figures are very important to me.

406
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,291
 They help me focus!

407
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,083
It'll be really nice if you memorise them..

408
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,708
 ..and drive the car accordingly.

409
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,000
 And yes, if there's any confusion..

410
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,000
..please take a printout from my secretary Rosy for reference.

411
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,541
 Umm, your office..

412
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,041
When I'm reading the paper, I want total silence!

413
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,250
 Absolutely no noise.

414
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,208
 Oh no, you've missed the turn!

415
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,708
 Nobody gave you the directions?

416
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,916
Should I focus on the market news or on the road?

417
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,791
 I was just about to ask you..

418
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,125
..but you said you like pin-drop silence in the car.

419
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,416
Now take the next exit, then left from the second red light..

420
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,791
 ..U-turn under the flyover...

421
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,333
...then third cut right, after 500 metres, the first left...

422
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,875
...then make a right at the T-point and 850 metres after that..

423
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,083
 ..the glass building on your left...

424
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,833
 ...that's our office!

425
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,750
 And if you have any confusion..

426
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,250
..take a printout from Rosy for reference.

427
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,583
 Hmmm, I forgot your name.

428
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,458
 Tanya.

429
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,500
Give me your number, in case I need to contact you.

430
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,750
 989174326

431
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,291
 I'm giving you a call.

432
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,750
 Save my number.

433
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,208
 I'm in office today till 6.05.

434
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,166
In case I need something, I'll let you know.

435
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,750
Terminator is here!!! What are you doing?

436
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,250
 Get to work, Immediately!

437
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,875
 Get to work, I say!

438
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,958
 Get to work, immediately!

439
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,291
 Rosy, get me the IT Park file, quick!

440
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,666
 Morning Sir!

441
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,708
Has the furniture consignment arrived from Milan?

442
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:51,958
 Yes Sir.

443
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,500
What about the serviced apartments project?

444
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,250
 Sir, the blueprints are ready.

445
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,375
 And the MCD case?

446
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,416
Sir, Mr. Prem Singh has a meeting with the lawyer tomorrow.

447
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,583
 And how's your mother now?

448
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,000
 Sir, she's much better now.

449
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,458
I hope there was no neglect in her treatment?

450
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:14,291
Sir everything was way beyond our expectations!

451
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,625
I really don't know how to thank you, Sir!

452
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,041
 Great.

453
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,625
 Let's get back to work then.

454
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,875
 Sure Sir.

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,958
Rosy. - Yes Sir.

456
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,125
I think I've left the golf course file in my car.

457
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,291
 Please send Lalchand to get it.

458
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,625
 Sure Sir.

459
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,083
Excuse me. - What's up, Ramesh.

460
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,666
 It's the same number!

461
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,791
 Who are you?

462
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,000
 Who are you!?

463
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:56,291
I'm Lalchand, the field manager of this office.

464
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,041
 And you'd be?

465
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,875
 Tanya.

466
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,166
 I drive this car.

467
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,750
That means Terminator has ousted Ramesh too!

468
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,041
 Terminator!?

469
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,750
 Your back-seat neighbour...

470
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,625
What a contrast his grandfather and he are!

471
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,625
The former hasn't changed a driver in decades...

472
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,916
...while firing drivers seems to be this one's hobby!

473
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:20,958
We've lost count but he still hasn't tired of throwing them out!

474
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,083
 What do you mean!?

475
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:29,208
In 3 years, he'd have fired at least 4 dozen drivers.

476
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,625
Once a driver drove a little fast over a speed-breaker. That's it.

477
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,333
 Terminator told him right there..

478
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:41,250
..to park the car aside, give him the keys and leave!

479
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,416
He fires people at the slightest pretext.

480
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:51,041
Though I don't think he'll do that to you.

481
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,500
At least not in the middle of the road!

482
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,125
 You're a girl, that's why!

483
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:03,333
Okay, Tanya ji, I reckon we'll be meeting every day...

484
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,708
 ...at least for the next few days.

485
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,500
 All the best!

486
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,375
 Terminator's old driver out!

487
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:22,041
 Terminator's new driver in...

488
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,291
 ...and she is sitting in the car!

489
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,458
 You mean, a girl?

490
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,625
 Yes! A girl!

491
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,875
 You're surely bluffing!

492
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,166
She's not a driver, she's a beauty queen, I'm telling you!

493
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,291
If you don't believe me, go have a look yourself!

494
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,125
 Do your work.

495
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,416
I think the AC is cooling a bit too much today!

496
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,958
It's putting a lot of pressure on my bladder.

497
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,000
 I'll just come.

498
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:03,291
Haven't taken a cigarette break for long!

499
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,208
 You carry on, workaholics.

500
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,375
 I'll be back.

501
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,750
Thank God someone's sitting in the car!

502
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,041
I thought the window has been accidentally left open!

503
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:23,666
These days you never know, someone might just steal the music system.

504
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,375
 By the way, I'm Jolly.

505
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,125
 Jolly Bhatnagar.

506
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,041
 Manager, sales department.

507
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,166
 It's really nice to meet you.

508
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,666
 Come upstairs sometime.

509
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,166
 We'll have coffee...

510
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,583
 ...with cream biscuits.

511
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,625
 All right then, I'll take your leave.

512
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,958
 Take care of yourself!

513
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,416
 Have a good day!

514
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,000
 Ramesh, give me a match..

515
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,083
 Oh! I'm so sorry!

516
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:57,375
I didn't know that boss has dismissed Ramesh.

517
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:01,000
But looking at you, I can say it was the right decision...

518
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,000
 ...rather what a beautiful decision!

519
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,500
 I'm sorry, what's wrong with me!

520
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,000
 I'm Ramakant.

521
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,916
Ramakant Dubey, manager, sales department.

522
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,083
 Come upstairs sometime.

523
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,958
 We'll have coffee together...

524
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,041
 Ya stuff like that.

525
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,791
Anyways, we'll be meeting each other often.

526
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,416
 I'll see you when I see you!

527
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,333
 Creep!

528
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,416
 Hi conman.

529
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,583
 Hey dude, wassup!

530
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,791
 So how was the surprise?

531
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,416
This plan of yours and Grandpa's to make me lose the bet..

532
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,500
 .. is not going to work.

533
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,666
 Good try though!

534
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,333
 You baffle me!

535
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,000
I expected you to say thank you, but you're being so ungrateful!

536
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,916
Do you know if everybody in India had a driver like her...

537
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,458
...how much the entire country will benefit!

538
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,833
At least people will stop peeping into others' cars!

539
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,750
 Very funny!

540
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,708
 It's not funny, it's a fact!

541
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:04,458
Okay, jokes apart, tell me honestly, what do you think of her?

542
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,333
 I don't have time for such frivolity.

543
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,666
 Frivolity!

544
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:12,708
She's a dynamo in looks and temperament both.

545
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,666
Just see, how this driver will change the direction of your life!

546
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,708
Time alone will tell who changes whose direction.

547
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,416
 Any ways stop sermonising now.

548
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,583
 I'll call you later.

549
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,458
So Krishanji, tomorrow please come to the battle ground on time.

550
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,166
 This Arjun doesn't like to wait.

551
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,333
I'm sorry if I caused you inconvenience in the morning.

552
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:49,208
But honestly, even I have no intention of making anyone wait!

553
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:57,625
 "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!"

554
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:00,625
 So Tanya...

555
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,625
 How was it with Terminator?

556
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,875
 Sorry!?

557
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,541
That's what the office staff call him, right?

558
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:15,208
Tanya, Arjun was seven when his mother passed away.

559
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,958
My son Sunil settled in London and he remarried.

560
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:24,458
Arjun has always lived with me, without his parents.

561
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,458
 He has a very kind heart Tanya,

562
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:33,291
but is just a little actually very stubborn!

563
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,250
But it gives me great pleasure to see someone..

564
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,833
 ..even more stubborn than him!

565
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,625
 Well done Tanya.

566
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,666
 Keep it up and God bless you.

567
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,291
 Thank you Grandpa.

568
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,083
 Hey Khullar! Bhatia, what's up?

569
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,250
Mr. Kapoor, you're quite a trendsetter!

570
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,666
Arjun's driver is an absolute knockout! - Yes.

571
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,000
 Have some shame guys!

572
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,416
 She's of your granddaughter's age!

573
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,250
She's of my granddaughter's age, but not my granddaughter, right!

574
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:19,458
Mr. Kapoor, half my life has been spent in the car!

575
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:22,583
From the house to the factory, from factory to the showroom and back.

576
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:26,166
If I'd thought of this unique idea earlier...

577
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,333
...at least half my life would have been pleasant!

578
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,083
Come shameless creatures, let's go for a walk.

579
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:37,250
Your brain will get some oxygen and purify your thoughts. - Okay.

580
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,291
Okay. - Lets go.

581
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,916
An urgent meeting has come up in the office.

582
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,166
 I have to leave early.

583
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,083
 Be there at 7.30 in the morning.

584
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,041
 Let's go!

585
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,625
 So Miss Hotshot Chauffeur!

586
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,375
 Tell me about your day.

587
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,083
 Don't ask!

588
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,000
For the first time in my life I've seen a man like this!

589
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,166
 Really!

590
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,625
 What's he like?

591
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,041
 Insufferable!

592
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,000
 I mean how's he to look at?

593
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,666
Is he like one of those heroes from Mills & Boon..

594
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,375
 ..tall, good-looking, rich, spoilt?

595
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:30,500
I don't know about the other qualities, but he's spoilt for sure...

596
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,708
 ...and very rude!

597
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,041
 Really!

598
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,833
I was expecting something else altogether!

599
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,291
I thought he'll ask you every few minutes..

600
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,833
 ..whether you're comfortable or not...

601
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,083
...if the AC temperature is okay for you...

602
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,500
...what music would you like to hear...

603
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,333
I thought he was going to be really chivalrous!

604
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:46,625
 Chivalrous!

605
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,833
I doubt if he even knows the spelling of chivalry!

606
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,833
As for the AC temperature, he didn't ask, he informed!

607
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,958
I like the AC temperature at a constant 18.5.

608
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,333
Neither less nor more! God I was freezing!

609
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:01,375
He even has to monitor what speed the car will be driven at!

610
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,458
 As for the music, he's very clear...

611
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:08,375
...he says he doesn't like noise in the car!

612
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,333
 Wow, he sounds like Hitler!

613
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,875
His office people have given him a perfect name: Terminator!

614
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,000
 He fires more than he hires!

615
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:20,708
 God, Tanny how will you cope with him?

616
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,916
 I don't know Pooja.

617
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,625
Spending six minutes with him is so torturous...

618
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,375
How I'm going to last six months, I don't know!

619
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,875
 "Let's go driver!"

620
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,625
 "Let's go driver!"

621
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,416
 "Go girl!"

622
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,875
 "Let's go driver!"

623
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,083
 "Girl dynamite driver."

624
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,541
 "Let's go driver!"

625
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,458
 "Prancing around!"

626
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,750
 "Dancing around!"

627
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,708
Today we'll go to the office not in this one, but in Bentley!

628
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,875
 "Let's go driver!"

629
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,000
 There's no Bentley over there!

630
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,708
 Damn!

631
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,208
 I live in the future so much!

632
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,583
I completely forgot that I'd ordered the Bentley just last week!

633
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,041
 It'll be delivered after two months.

634
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,666
 All right then, get the Audi back.

635
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,875
 Let's go in that one only!

636
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,041
 Scumbag!

637
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,041
 "Let's go driver."

638
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,291
 Music!

639
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,583
You had an early morning meeting, right!

640
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,666
 It got cancelled.

641
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,458
 I don't know why he's such a jerk!

642
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,291
 You said something?

643
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,166
 No!

644
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,000
 I don't know why she's so arrogant!

645
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,625
 You said something?

646
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,625
 No!

647
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:41,166
God, please give me one chance to teach him a lesson.

648
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,541
 Please, I beg of you!

649
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,125
 Hi Tanya!

650
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,333
 Oh hi!?

651
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,166
 Meet my fiance Priyanka.

652
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,333
Hi Tanya. - Hi.

653
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,416
You know, Tanya, ever since I have heard about you..

654
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,375
 ..I've been so fascinated!

655
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,000
Today girls are excelling in every field..

656
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,666
..but what you are doing is truly commendable.

657
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,875
 That too after being so well-educated!

658
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,833
 I truly admire your guts!

659
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,125
 Thanks Priyanka..

660
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,041
..but I honestly think that whatever I'm doing is very normal!

661
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,208
After all, I'm just driving a car, not a fighter plane!

662
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,500
 What are you saying, Tanya!

663
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:32,250
Driving a car in India is no less than driving a fighter plane!

664
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:35,041
 Have you seen how people drive!

665
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,625
And especially, seeing a girl at the wheel..

666
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:41,708
 ..brings out their animal instincts.

667
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,791
They will overtake, even if they don't have to!

668
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,375
And, Oh God, have you seen how men stare inside the car?

669
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,041
Men will never understand this predicament!

670
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,583
I had understood it the very first day, ..

671
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,666
 ..but who can explain it to Arjun!

672
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,916
 Don't even get me started on him!

673
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,416
 For him everything in life is a bet!

674
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,583
 As in!?

675
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:03,125
Left to him, he'd make even breathing into a bet.

676
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:07,375
You're aware right that your job is thanks to a bet too!

677
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,166
Yes, he'd entered into a bet with Grandpa...

678
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:17,791
...that he'll retain his next driver his 46th in 3 years..

679
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,750
 .. for six months.

680
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,666
And he's fulfilling that obligation for the past 2 weeks.

681
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:28,333
Otherwise, looking at his track record, by now, you'd have..

682
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,500
 Oh!

683
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,125
That's why Grandpa had made me sign the contract for six months!!

684
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:37,541
Just like it's essential for the sun to rise every morning...

685
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,625
...it's equally important for Arjun to win every bet.

686
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,875
In fact if I need to get anything done from him..

687
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,375
 ..I simply enter into a bet with him.

688
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,166
His ego gets satisfied and I too get my work done!

689
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,666
 'Interesting'!

690
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,416
 Great!

691
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,375
We'll go wish the big boss! - Yes. Yes.

692
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,583
 See you later.

693
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,541
All right Tanya, it was lovely meeting you.

694
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,250
I'll see you around, okay, bye-bye! - Bye.

695
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:05,541
 Hmm Arjun smarty-pants!

696
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,708
 You've caused me so much distress!

697
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:11,208
 It's payback time now.

698
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,958
 "Go girl...Go girl...Go girl!"

699
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,666
 Nice book.

700
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,291
 Have you read it?

701
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,666
 I've read all of Wayne Dyer's books.

702
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,000
 Hmm!

703
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,958
 He writes very well...

704
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,500
Just that I'm not very convinced by one theory of his!

705
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,916
 Which theory?

706
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,708
 He says that if a man so decides..

707
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:45,041
..he can do whatever he wants, big or small.

708
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,916
I don't quite agree with that. - "Go girl.."

709
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,291
 Why?

710
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:52,375
I feel every person is cut out for a particular work...

711
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,416
...and every work is cut out for a particular person.

712
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,375
 Nobody can do everything...

713
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,250
 I think that's impossible.

714
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,000
 Why is it impossible?

715
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,000
 Take Bill Gates for example.

716
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,541
 His capability lies in the IT field.

717
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,333
 That's why he excels in that.

718
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:15,041
But if he tried to become a plumber, I don't think he'll be able to!

719
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,166
 Wrong!

720
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,500
 I don't agree!

721
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,666
I think if Bill Gates is determined enough, he can become anything...

722
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,375
 ...doctor, musician, teacher...

723
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,041
 ...even a plumber!

724
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,875
 I don't think so!

725
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,958
Any ways, let's consider another example...

726
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,791
Driving! - "Go girl.."

727
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,416
According to me, not everyone can be a driver!

728
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:40,416
It needs a special skill, a special temperament...

729
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,083
...which not everyone has! - "Go girl.."

730
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,458
 What's the big deal in that!

731
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,958
I simply believe that once you have a rock-solid willpower..

732
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,958
 ..nothing is impossible.

733
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:55,708
Take my example: If I want, I can do anything!

734
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,875
 Anything at all!

735
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,458
In fact, if I want, I can become a top-class driver too!

736
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,083
 I don't know!

737
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,333
I'm doing it because I have different capabilities!

738
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,500
 But it's not everyone's cup of tea!

739
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,833
I can prove you wrong! - "Go girl.."

740
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,791
 Please don't take it personally.

741
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:16,291
 I was just..

742
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,791
No, no, let's see how much confidence you have in your theory!

743
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,041
 I stick by what I just said.

744
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,041
 All right then.

745
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,750
 Now I'll show you!

746
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,583
I'll become a driver and disprove your theory! - "Go girl.."

747
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,541
Do you want to bet! - "Let's go driver."

748
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,375
 I don't know what to say!

749
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,500
 How about this weekend?

750
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,833
Actually my aunt and uncle are coming from Chandigarh.

751
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,375
I was thinking of showing them around Delhi!

752
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,750
 Perfect!

753
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,000
 Don't reveal my identity to them.

754
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:52,541
Just pretend that I'm your driver, employed by the company..

755
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,708
 ..in which you work.

756
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:57,083
Two days I'll drive them around Delhi, and also prove to you that...

757
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,875
...if I want, nothing is impossible for me!

758
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,000
 All right, if you so insist!

759
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,125
 But what would the bet be?

760
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,333
You really enjoy listening to music in the car, don't you! - Yes.

761
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:13,541
If you win, you can play as much music in the car as you want...

762
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,041
...and if I win, which I obviously will...

763
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,208
 ...then you'll have to even forget..

764
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,625
 ..where the music system buttons are!

765
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,041
 I accept.

766
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,625
 Bet!?

767
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:27,791
 Bet.

768
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,500
 "Let's go, driver."

769
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:42,416
 "Let's go, driver."

770
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,291
 So that's Arjun, your boss-cum-driver!

771
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,208
So, Miss Fake Marketing Manager, what's the plan?

772
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,625
 Today, we shall do Delhi sightseeing.

773
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:00,875
 And tomorrow's for shopping.

774
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,000
I think two days are enough to teach Terminator a lesson. - "Go girl."

775
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,958
That too, two days with him and Pappu Uncle together in the same car!

776
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,958
They'll get along like a house on fire!

777
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:11,750
 By the way, where is Pappu Uncle?

778
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,958
 Yes, go for it Zaheer!

779
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,708
 Just two more wickets needed!

780
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,500
 Yes, c'mon, c'mon!

781
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,083
 Uncle the driver's here.

782
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,000
 So what! Drivers are supposed to wait.

783
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,083
 It's their job!

784
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,375
 Look at this man!

785
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,333
 It's been 26 years to our marriage!

786
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,541
 He hasn't taken me out anywhere!

787
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,250
And today, when we've got such a golden opportunity...

788
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,166
...this stupid match is throwing a spanner in the works!

789
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,958
 As if their uncles were playing!

790
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,500
Look I'm warning you not to insult me any further!

791
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:39,791
 I'll count till three.

792
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:41,166
 Switch off the TV yourself..

793
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,041
 ..or I will switch it off.

794
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,166
 One...

795
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,625
 She is too much.

796
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,166
 Two...

797
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,291
 Here Mrs Sweety!

798
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,333
 See I've switched it off. No tension.

799
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,500
 Happy!

800
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,916
Now please be done with your spiel as well!

801
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,166
 26 years have somehow lapsed.

802
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,666
But the 2 days that we are in Delhi, let me be at peace at least!

803
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,000
 Let's move then.

804
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:05,541
Tanya, my child, you do get FM radio in your car, right!?

805
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:09,083
Yes uncle, you'll love the match commentary in the car even more!

806
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,750
 Come.

807
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,250
 "Let's go, driver."

808
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,458
 Hello!

809
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,458
 Keep the bag in the boot!

810
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,666
Why are you standing transfixed, like a Madame Tussauds' statue?

811
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,750
Tanya, you should have told me that the driver is such a young chap!

812
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:48,083
 Would have preened myself up a bit.

813
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,333
 What's your name?

814
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,583
 Arjun.

815
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,583
Do you deem it improper to clean the car?

816
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,250
 See it's gathered so much dust!

817
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:01,041
Driving doesn't simply mean working the wheel!!

818
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,375
 Thinking himself to be a great driver.

819
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,250
 All the best!

820
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,125
 "Go girl."

821
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:29,125
 Let's go, driver!

822
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,541
 "Let's go, driver."

823
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:35,458
 Let's see what state the match is in!

824
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,333
'Three balls left and four runs required.'

825
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,750
 'And only one wicket left.'

826
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,166
 India..

827
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,625
 How dare you!

828
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,208
 Do you have no manners at all!

829
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,500
 You dare not turn it off this time!

830
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,750
Uncle I normally don't like to listen..

831
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:04,916
 .. to music in the car, that's why!

832
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,458
But if you really want to, it's fine...

833
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:11,041
 'And that's an excellent victory.'

834
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:13,666
'And this match India has..' - Yes! Yes!

835
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,958
 Yes! Yes!

836
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,833
 India has won the match, dude!

837
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,875
 Hey listen, I can understand..

838
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,333
..that you have absolutely no sense of propriety...

839
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,416
...but at least you can compensate in your driving!

840
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,583
 Is this how one drives?

841
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,458
 Nonsense!

842
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,625
 Relax champ!

843
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,375
 Till now you've never lost a bet!

844
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,041
You have to win this one too, no matter what!

845
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,250
 "Let's go, driver."

846
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,791
Today's weather is cool, isn't it? - Yes.

847
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,458
 Definitely you will enjoy.

848
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:50,875
 Oh, Sir's phone is ringing!

849
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,458
 Yes Rosy.

850
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,333
 See, I've spoken to Mishra ji!

851
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:56,625
How can you allow him to use the phone while driving!

852
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,333
 ..and I'll do paper work.

853
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,791
He's going to get us a ticket for sure!

854
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,041
 I'll talk to you later.

855
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,333
So what if you've learnt two words of English...

856
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:09,083
...and are wearing a dry-cleaned uniform!

857
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,375
Next time you feel like talking to this Rosy or Lotus of yours..

858
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,916
 ..do it off-duty, not while driving.

859
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,541
I'm sure your salary won't be as much as the ticket we'd have got!

860
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:19,958
 Don't give me that look now, okay!

861
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:24,166
We've come to Delhi to enjoy, not to be martyred!

862
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,041
 Please switch off the AC.

863
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,291
 But Aunty, the temperature is alright!

864
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:33,541
And we that have been reduced to frozen chicken on the back seat!

865
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,125
 It's scaldingly hot outside!

866
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,458
 But not inside!

867
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,458
 Is the AC running inside or outside?

868
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,750
If madam is telling you to switch off the AC,..

869
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,791
 .. then simply switch it off!

870
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,750
 Thank you buddy!

871
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,041
 My name is not buddy!

872
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,708
Look, Karan.. - Arjun.

873
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:52,875
 Do you have to argue every time!

874
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,708
 What's in a name, any ways!

875
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,166
 I'm in such good mood right now.

876
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,500
 India has won the match.

877
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:03,000
Be quiet for some time, and let peace prevail.

878
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:06,500
 Where are we headed, Tanya?

879
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:07,916
 Tanya!?

880
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,916
 He addresses you as Tanya?

881
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,416
 Do you have no shame?

882
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,541
 You call madam by her name!?

883
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,083
Is this what your parents have taught you?

884
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,250
 Sorry ma'am! Where do we have to go?

885
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,875
 Qutub Minar.

886
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,666
 Right, ma'am!

887
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,875
Now don't start asking, why do we have go...

888
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,916
...is it important, cant' we go tomorrow!

889
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,875
 "This is called.."

890
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,250
 "This is called tit for tat"

891
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,416
 "This is called.."

892
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,916
 "This is called tit for tat"

893
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,750
 "This is called tit for tat"

894
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:57,500
 "The boy will not forget this lesson"

895
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:01,500
 "This is called tit for tat"

896
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,875
 "The boy will not forget this lesson"

897
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,083
 "He is duly chastised"

898
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,250
 "His ego has got a crackling blow"

899
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,416
 "This is called.."

900
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:12,708
 "This is called tit for tat"

901
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,083
 "This is called.."

902
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:18,041
 "This is called tit for tat"

903
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,458
"He thought it's going to be a cakewalk"

904
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,666
 "But it's turning out to be an ordeal"

905
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,041
 "Now he's going through a turmoil"

906
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:36,541
 "Boy, he's going bonkers"

907
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:43,291
"He thought it's going to be a cakewalk"

908
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,083
 "But it's turning out to be an ordeal"

909
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,000
 "Now he's going through a turmoil"

910
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,291
 "Boy, he's going bonkers"

911
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,958
 "Boy, he's going bonkers"

912
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:56,708
 "This is called tit for tat"

913
00:50:56,791 --> 00:51:01,291
 "This is called tit for tat"

914
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,291
 "Pappu is quite a dynamo"

915
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,625
 "He paid no heed to any of his pleas"

916
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,000
 "Now he has no desires left"

917
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,791
 "He is learning it the hard way"

918
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,166
 "Pappu is quite a dynamo"

919
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:38,041
 "He paid no heed to any of his pleas"

920
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:40,250
 "Now he has no desires left"

921
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,541
 "He is learning it the hard way"

922
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:47,541
 "This is called tit for tat"

923
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:52,166
 "This is called tit for tat"

924
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,708
 "This is called tit for tat"

925
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:06,291
 "The boy will not forget this lesson"

926
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,500
 "He is duly chastised"

927
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,666
 "His ego has got a crackling blow"

928
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,291
 "This is called tit for tat"

929
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:20,416
 "This is called tit for tat"

930
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,125
 "Tit for tat"

931
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,916
Drivers are supposed to step out and open the door for you!

932
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,375
 He's good for nothing.

933
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,250
 What happened, Wax Museum?

934
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,000
 We've got a flat tyre.

935
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:42,708
 Why do you need to broadcast it?

936
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,125
 Just go and change the tyre!

937
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,500
 Not possible!

938
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,000
 What do you mean by that?

939
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,541
Are we supposed to carry this car over our head?

940
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,166
I don't know how to change a flat tyre.

941
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,041
 Just our luck!

942
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,958
 Driving you don't know...

943
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,083
...manners you don't have, clean it you can't...

944
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,833
...and now to top it, you can't even change a tyre!

945
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:05,750
I'm sure you must have bribed someone to get this job!

946
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,375
 What'll we do now?

947
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,875
 Don't worry Aunty. I'll have a look.

948
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,208
 See, learn something from her!

949
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:21,750
Left to you, I'm sure Tanya would be at the wheel...

950
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,541
...and you'd be lounging on the back seat, coolly reading a paper!

951
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,916
 That's how it usually goes.

952
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,125
 What!?

953
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:27,416
 Nothing!

954
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,666
I meant that every day the car drives smoothly.

955
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,208
 Never had a flat tyre before!

956
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,916
 Today is the first time.

957
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,333
 Tanya, child, you step aside now.

958
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,500
 Let me help you.

959
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,000
Please help her. - It's okay Uncle.

960
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,291
 It's almost done.

961
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,750
 She's saying it's almost done!

962
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,666
 Look at him! What a lazy lout he is!

963
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:55,750
His employer is changing the tyre while ..

964
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,041
 .. he's the picture of indifference!

965
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:02,291
 Utterly shameless, I tell you!

966
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,583
 At least you should lend her a hand!

967
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,375
He has lethargy written all over his face!

968
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,666
 Don't ask sisters!

969
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,041
These days you just don't get good servants, you see!

970
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,416
I must say, this world has become topsy-turvy.

971
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,625
 The owner works and the driver rests.

972
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,708
 "Let's go, driver."

973
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:31,666
 Thank God, you do something at least!

974
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:35,416
Now will you reach us home or should we take a cab from here?

975
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,708
 A bus would take you there too!

976
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,041
 What!?

977
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,750
 Nothing! Let's go!

978
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,958
 Now what happened, Slow Motion!

979
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,041
 We'll have to look for a gas station!

980
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:00,625
 Thank God!

981
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,791
 We've finally reached!

982
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:06,000
 "Let's go, driver."

983
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,458
 I don't know how Tanya tolerates him!

984
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:15,333
If he were my driver, I'd have thrown him out in 5 minutes!

985
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:16,625
 Be quiet. He might hear it!

986
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:17,916
 As if I care!

987
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:24,583
 Listen you: focus on work!

988
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,708
And yes, if possible, do try to smile sometime.

989
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:32,333
I've heard it's a good exercise to burn calories!

990
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:33,875
 Okay!

991
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,875
 Good night then, Karan.

992
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,041
 Good night!

993
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,625
 I have mended dozens like him.

994
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:42,916
 I'm sorry!

995
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,083
 Uncle was too rude today.

996
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,250
 It's okay.

997
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,041
Some people are like that: complicated!

998
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,833
 They don't really care about others.

999
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:56,791
I don't like you being insulted like that!

1000
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:00,125
 If you wish, we can call off the bet!

1001
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,291
 Nope.

1002
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,375
 A bet is a bet is a bet.

1003
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,375
 There's no question of calling it off!

1004
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,458
 I'll see you tomorrow.

1005
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,666
Oh, and yes, drop the bag upstairs, fast!

1006
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,875
 Come, child, he'll get it.

1007
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,625
Hi sexy! - Hi.

1008
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:32,166
 So, how was Arjun's court martial?

1009
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,583
 It was hilarious!

1010
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:37,125
It seemed like one Arjun is talking to another!

1011
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:42,166
Tell me, how did he manage to control himself?

1012
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,333
 Don't ask!

1013
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:47,750
The way Uncle was ragging him, I thought he'll explode any moment!

1014
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,083
 But he was pretty well-mannered!

1015
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,708
Really!? - Ya.

1016
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,833
I guess, he doesn't mind Pappu Uncle, after all!

1017
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:04,000
But for the bet, I'd worked that Pappu guy into a pulp!

1018
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,125
 He was telling me:

1019
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,583
 Oye Karan, clean the car nicely...

1020
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,416
...drive properly; concentrate on the road...

1021
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,291
...don't you have manners; switch off the AC; turn on the commentary!

1022
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,916
 Am I a human being or a robot!

1023
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,875
 Will see you, Chandigarh Express!

1024
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,708
Till now I used to think that you're the only one of your kind.

1025
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,958
But this Pappu Uncle seems to be your xerox copy!

1026
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,000
And he's picked out the same points as you!

1027
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,250
 Shut up Sam!

1028
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,541
There is a world of difference between us!

1029
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:27,875
 Ya, the difference is ..

1030
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,458
.. that he said all these points to a single driver...

1031
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,583
...while you used to say it to different ones at different times.

1032
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,833
 Enough of your moral science lecture!

1033
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,458
 Already my head's spinning!

1034
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,208
Are we having dinner or should I go home?

1035
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,041
Why, didn't you have dinner with your Pappu Uncle!

1036
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:45,750
 Okay, come on.

1037
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,166
 Come, let's go!

1038
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:51,375
 Tell me, is my car okay!

1039
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:54,041
I hope you didn't vent out Pappu Uncle's anger on it!

1040
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,625
 O Sweety I want your love.

1041
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:03,875
 O Sweety I want your love.

1042
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:07,875
 Not once but a thousand times over.

1043
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:11,500
 O Sweety I want your love.

1044
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,166
 Not once but a thousand times over.

1045
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,666
Sweety, Sweety, Sweety, O my love Sweety!

1046
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,125
 She blushes, I tell you!

1047
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,666
 Stop it now!

1048
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,291
It's okay! We're all family here...except one!

1049
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,291
 Look, the cop's here.

1050
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,125
 Roll down the window.

1051
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,500
 Do you have to douse a fire somewhere?

1052
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,958
 Driving at 80!

1053
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,125
 Show me your licence.

1054
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,708
Tanya. - Show the car papers. - Yes, Uncle.

1055
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:53,375
 I think this driver is a thief!

1056
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:55,750
 Why Uncle?

1057
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:57,416
 Just look at his wallet!

1058
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,083
 It has so many credit cards.

1059
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,000
I think he's stolen them! - Show me.

1060
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,166
 No Uncle!

1061
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,750
 Actually, our company has given him!

1062
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,208
 You know, to fill up gas in the car.

1063
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:08,916
 So many credit cards!

1064
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,041
 To buy gas or to buy a gas station!

1065
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:22,041
 The road is not a racetrack.

1066
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,833
If not for you, somebody must be waiting at home for others at least.

1067
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,750
 I'm letting you go this time ..

1068
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,625
..because of these ladies, but don't repeat it!

1069
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:34,166
 Thank you sir!

1070
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:35,541
 Control room.

1071
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,125
Didn't realise at all when the speed went up!

1072
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,583
Check if the car is driving of its own accord!?

1073
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:53,416
 Hurry up. Come on.

1074
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,625
The chocolates are looking so tempting!

1075
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,791
Seeing a chocolate shop is enough to make her drool.

1076
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,500
 Oh no!

1077
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:03,666
 Arjun sir!

1078
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,000
 O hello, Mr. Sahni!

1079
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:09,541
How are you? - How are you? - I'm absolutely fine.

1080
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:10,750
 What a pleasant surprise!

1081
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,875
I'd come for a lunch meeting at the restaurant.

1082
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,916
 And you!?

1083
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,083
Actually my Aunty-Uncle are here from Chandigarh.

1084
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,541
I thought I should do something special for them. - Good!

1085
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:22,916
That's why I'm posing as a driver for..

1086
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,333
 ..a day and taking them around Delhi.

1087
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:25,625
 That's a nice gesture.

1088
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,958
Now, my philosophy is that whatever one does..

1089
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,333
..one should do it with complete earnestness.

1090
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,000
 That's why I'm donning this uniform!

1091
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,125
 Looking so nice!

1092
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:32,583
That was so nice, isn't it? - Yes.

1093
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:33,916
That one too. - Even I have it in Chandigarh.

1094
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,750
You know, but I'm having a great time. - I'm sure.

1095
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,541
You guys should try it too! - Hey driver!

1096
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,166
I told them emphatically to think of me as their driver..

1097
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,958
 ..and address me as one too.

1098
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:45,041
It should look authentic, you know! - Yes.

1099
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,750
 All right. You have a great day.

1100
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,333
 I'll see you later, then gentlemen.

1101
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:49,500
 Yeah. Sure.

1102
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:50,666
Bye. - Have a nice time.

1103
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,458
 Who were they?

1104
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,958
And what was that round-table conference all about!

1105
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:00,166
 My ex-boss!

1106
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:03,208
He said that I should join back and that they'll double my salary!

1107
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,458
 I told them I'll think about it.

1108
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:08,083
What nonsense! I have seen these tactics before.

1109
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,250
 Stay put where you are, alright!

1110
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,583
 Enough now!

1111
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,875
Arjun, can you get us tickets for the new Rajkumar Hirani movie?

1112
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,541
 In Chandigarh, he has no time for me.

1113
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,000
But today I'm resolved to see this movie at any cost!

1114
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:23,791
 But I've already seen that one!

1115
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:27,916
 Hello. You are a classic pile-on.

1116
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,333
 Self-inviting yourself!

1117
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:35,208
Now go, get three tickets of Gold Class, last row centre seats.

1118
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,416
 Take this.

1119
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,416
You'll get only one ticket in this much money!

1120
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,541
We don't have to buy gold, only watch a movie in Gold Class!

1121
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,708
And you're saying as if you keep sitting there every day!

1122
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,041
 I'll take it on my credit card.

1123
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,333
 See the real use of the credit card!

1124
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,166
 It's okay uncle.

1125
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,541
 Let me treat you to this one.

1126
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,750
I'll get the tickets. - Why should you go?

1127
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,750
 What is this James Bond for!

1128
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:07,041
 Okay.

1129
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,333
 Okay!?

1130
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,708
 No, it's not okay.

1131
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,291
You're hurt! I don't want to break your heart.

1132
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,291
If it makes you happy, you only give the money.

1133
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,166
 Give me my note back.

1134
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,875
 I don't want to hurt her.

1135
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,750
And yes, remember to return the balance to madam.

1136
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,041
Don't pocket it, thinking it to be office account.

1137
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,125
 Can't break the child's heart, right!

1138
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,083
 Here, take it!

1139
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:33,916
Give me three tickets for Munnabhai Returns,..

1140
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,166
 ..the 2 o'clock show please.

1141
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:41,666
Oh, and by the way, first row, centre seats, Gold Class please!

1142
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:46,000
 James Bond is here. Give it to me.

1143
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,041
 Take your balance Tanya.

1144
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,583
Listen up, we'll be free in about three hours or so.

1145
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:54,375
You keep these bags in the car and wait there for us.

1146
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,208
Even today you want me to wait in the car!

1147
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,583
 So wait outside the car then!

1148
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,000
 Hurry up, the movie's about to start.

1149
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:01,541
Left to this man, we'd miss half the film!

1150
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,916
 Come on, let's go.

1151
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,375
 But where are you?

1152
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,375
 I am waiting in mall. Where are you?

1153
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,083
 Hey monster mind!

1154
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:32,291
How is Arjun's court martial at the hands of Pappu Uncle?

1155
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,166
 I hope you're having fun!

1156
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:38,375
 Oh, so you're trying to con Arjun!

1157
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,416
 No worries.

1158
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,416
 The movie's just begun, my friend!

1159
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,791
 "Let's go, driver."

1160
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,750
 This hero resembles Arjun so much!

1161
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:10,500
 What a waste of money!

1162
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,416
You should have seen Arjun live instead!

1163
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,875
 He's utterly useless!

1164
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:22,041
I'd asked him to get the last row seats and he got the first row!

1165
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:29,500
Now stop gaping at the hero, and concentrate on the film!

1166
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:39,041
What a movie it was! - Really. It was fun.

1167
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:43,875
 Meaningful as well as entertaining.

1168
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:47,541
Holy cow! - What?

1169
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,166
 So you guys are finally here.

1170
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,208
We'd asked him to wait in the car for three hours..

1171
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,875
 ..not three hundred years!

1172
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,583
What has become of him! - Come.. come.. come.

1173
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,541
 Actually Arjun suddenly fell ill.

1174
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:08,750
Somebody seems to have tortured him mercilessly.

1175
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:12,625
So the company management sent me to take care of you.

1176
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:17,250
By the looks of it, we'll have to take care of you, Uncle, isn't it?

1177
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,375
 You seem to very naughty!

1178
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,708
 Nonetheless, my name is Salim Uncle.

1179
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:27,083
 And what would be your introduction?

1180
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,833
 I don't praise myself.

1181
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:32,041
 My name is Pappu...and this is my..

1182
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:36,125
 What a flawlessly lustrous beauty!

1183
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:38,416
 Seems to be your daughter.

1184
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:43,583
Wonderful! Hasn't taken after her father one bit!

1185
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:48,291
 And this must be your granddaughter!

1186
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:53,291
Truly it's a pleasure to have met your family.

1187
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,291
 Also it makes me observe..

1188
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,833
..that everyone in your family is very beautiful..

1189
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,250
 ..except you, Pupu.

1190
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,250
 My name is Pappu!

1191
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:03,458
 What's in a name!

1192
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:06,250
Karan or Arjun, they're both the same, right?

1193
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,500
 Why doesn't it make a difference?

1194
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,375
If I call you Salma instead of Salim, would you like it?

1195
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,750
 Salma Uncle?

1196
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:14,750
Pupu, why are you shouting at me like that!

1197
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,291
 God have mercy.

1198
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,708
 I am feeling uneasy.

1199
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,583
Somebody give me water, please! - Yes.

1200
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,208
I knew that we'll only have to take care of him!

1201
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,083
 I'm fainting!

1202
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,375
 Give it to me. Here.

1203
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:29,958
Here gulp this. - What are you doing?

1204
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,291
 You want to take my life or what!

1205
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,125
 I only drink mineral water.

1206
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,416
 I'll get it for you.

1207
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,291
 You stay here with me, girl.

1208
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,541
 Pupu will go get it.

1209
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,125
 Are you out of your mind?

1210
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,583
 Go quickly.

1211
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,041
 Don't be so cruel now.

1212
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:46,958
 Quickly go get some water for him.

1213
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,208
 Go quickly!

1214
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:52,416
 Go quickly! And get some water for me.

1215
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,041
 O wow!

1216
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,250
It seems like Granduncle is being taken care of very well.

1217
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,041
 Take your hand off her.

1218
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:06,625
 Here, have this.

1219
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,708
 O no! You've got me the wrong brand!

1220
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,083
 I don't have this one.

1221
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:12,333
Listen up, old man, this is water, not whiskey..

1222
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,625
..that you drink it keeping the brand in mind.

1223
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,333
 Have it or else I'm throwing it away.

1224
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,166
 You've started shouting at me again!

1225
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,125
Go get all the other brands. - Go get all the other brands.

1226
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:26,250
Quickly go. - Don't waste any more time, Pupu.

1227
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:34,416
 Here, I've got all the other brands.

1228
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,541
Have whichever one like, before the Final Call comes.

1229
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:39,333
 This is not needed now.

1230
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,791
 I'm feeling fine just like that.

1231
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,708
Oh so your lease seems to have been extended by a few more months!

1232
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,500
 Now should we go home Uncle ..

1233
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:48,250
.. or you wish to reduce my weight any further.

1234
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:50,208
 Ya sure, why not!

1235
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:56,250
Keep telling me every now and then if there's any car ahead of..

1236
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,750
 ..beside or behind us.

1237
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:02,541
The thing is that my vision gets blurred after 5.15 in the evening.

1238
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:05,000
Okay.. okay. - But don't be alarmed.

1239
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:08,250
You'll definitely reach us to our heavenly abode, uncle.

1240
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,208
 Give me the keys.

1241
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,666
 I'll drive the car.

1242
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,250
You come and sit on the front seat next to me.

1243
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:15,375
 Not at all, mister.

1244
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,791
The thing is that if someone else is driving..

1245
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,916
 ..I prefer to sit on the back seat.

1246
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,708
 Otherwise, it gives me palpitations.

1247
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:25,375
 Oh gosh!

1248
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:29,250
Where does your company find such morons from?

1249
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,041
Sweety, you come and sit on the front seat with me.

1250
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,541
I hope you sit on the back seat with me, fair one!

1251
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,291
 It'll give me some support.

1252
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:39,958
Old Uncle, she's my wife, not your company's freight goods!

1253
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,708
Quickly sit in the car, before this Mughal emperor..

1254
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:45,041
..Bahadur Shah Zafar, does your full inspection!

1255
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,041
You too sit in the car now. - Come girl, let's go.

1256
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,750
 Come Pupu, come.

1257
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,583
 The name's Pappu.

1258
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,166
 You know how to drive, right, Pupu?

1259
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,000
 What difference does it make Uncle!

1260
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,583
Had you driven, we'd have gone heavenwards too!

1261
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:05,333
 I've been itching to say something.

1262
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,750
 Should I?

1263
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,250
 Sure Uncle.

1264
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:10,125
At this age, anyway, you should not keep any dream unfulfilled.

1265
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,666
 Who knows if tomorrow comes or not.

1266
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,125
 Let's go, driver!

1267
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:21,041
 Let's go!

1268
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,625
We've got the old man up till here, but how will he go home?

1269
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:38,083
 Don't worry about me, son Pupu.

1270
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:42,875
This ailment affects only from 5.15 To 6.45.

1271
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:49,458
Post that I become perfect, and even my eyesight becomes 66.

1272
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:53,083
 Why don't you pick up these bags?

1273
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,875
He just said that he becomes all right after 7.15!

1274
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,583
 Spare a thought about his age.

1275
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,416
 Oh, so now you've started coughing!

1276
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:04,125
 Here, give me the bags.

1277
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:11,458
 Okay Pupu, and Pupu's dear family...

1278
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,833
...if God so wills we shall meet again.

1279
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:20,208
 I hope that situation never arises!

1280
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,416
 You said something, Pupu?

1281
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,041
Uncle, I was just saying that you should take off your glasses now.

1282
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:28,416
Who's going to admire your modelling this late at night!

1283
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,958
 These are my night-vision goggles.

1284
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,166
They help me see road and people clearly.

1285
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,875
Okay, Tanaaya, I will see you tomorrow.

1286
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,333
 I'm really worried about Arjun.

1287
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,750
Don't quite know what state he'd be in.

1288
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,000
 Okay let's go.

1289
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:50,166
If you're so worried, then let's take him with us to Chandigarh.

1290
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,833
 We'll make him our scooter's driver.

1291
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,041
 No music in the car from today.

1292
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,791
 I'll be a good girl!

1293
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,000
 Turn on the music please.

1294
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:08,083
 But..

1295
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:11,958
Now that you've decided, I'll also have to be a good guy right!

1296
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:24,000
 Have a nice day!

1297
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:26,291
 You too!

1298
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:43,291
 It's become really hot.

1299
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,333
I don't think it'll be very comfortable to sit in the car.

1300
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:48,291
 No, no, I'll be fine. Thanks.

1301
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,500
There's a lounge inside. It's mostly empty.

1302
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,208
 Come with me.

1303
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,083
 I insist.

1304
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:57,791
 Okay.

1305
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:01,708
In case you need anything tell Lalchand or...

1306
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,666
 ..let me know!

1307
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,916
 Sure!

1308
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,125
Yeah! - Thanks.

1309
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:29,583
 Tell me, what's your favourite book?

1310
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:31,583
 The Secret.

1311
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,333
 Now that's uncanny!

1312
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,375
 It's my favourite book too!

1313
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,875
Really? - Absolutely.

1314
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:40,041
So you must be believing in the book's principles too!

1315
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,666
 I mean, The Law of Attraction!

1316
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,083
 Completely!

1317
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:47,791
I am of the firm belief that what we desire..

1318
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,875
..with all our being truly comes to be...

1319
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,500
 What's this?

1320
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:29,041
 Miami's best hotel.

1321
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,875
 Today is 21st September.

1322
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:40,000
 Exactly six months have passed.

1323
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:44,666
 See, I defeated you!

1324
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:49,375
It's a special high losing to you, son.

1325
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:54,708
I pray that you win every battle in life.

1326
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,000
 Should we go this Sunday?

1327
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,833
 We have multiple-entry visa anyway.

1328
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:02,875
You're no less than the sprinter PT Usha.

1329
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:05,000
 Let's go at leisure next month.

1330
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,708
Anyway I have to go out of town tomorrow for a couple of days.

1331
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:13,416
Why!? - It's my friend, Gupta's son's wedding.

1332
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,375
 But I'll be back in two days.

1333
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,875
 Till then, you get tickets done.

1334
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:22,500
And do one thing: make a plan for the 10th or 12th of next month.

1335
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,125
 Have a look at the hotel at least!

1336
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:29,500
 We'll go wherever you like, my boy.

1337
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:30,916
 Even a strip club!

1338
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,083
 Definitely!

1339
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:34,083
Will you take a lap dance? - Why not!

1340
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,458
 Grandpa you're too mischievous!

1341
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,833
 After all, whose grandfather am I!

1342
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,916
Hi! - Hi!

1343
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,541
 Big day, right!

1344
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,625
 You know what's the occasion today?

1345
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,708
 Sameer had told me about the bet.

1346
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:54,375
 That bet was just a joke, you know!

1347
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:55,916
 It's totally cool!

1348
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:58,291
In fact, even I'd signed a contract that..

1349
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:00,375
..I won't leave this job for six months.

1350
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:01,833
 Contract!?

1351
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,750
 When did that happen!?

1352
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,500
 Wow!

1353
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,500
I used to think that I'm the only mastermind.

1354
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,125
 But others are no less.

1355
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,791
 So, in fact, I should thank you...

1356
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,375
 ...for not leaving this job!

1357
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,500
Actually I did it for a personal reason.

1358
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:24,458
I needed money, and Grandpa gave me such a good offer that..

1359
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:26,583
 ..I simply couldn't refuse.

1360
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,208
 So, what's your plan now?

1361
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:35,458
I'll go to Chandigarh and open an adventure travel agency..

1362
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,125
 ..in my parents' name.

1363
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:40,916
 I've waited really long for this day!

1364
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,208
So you've decided that you'll not come to work from tomorrow?

1365
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:49,375
Please don't mind but I did this all for a goal.

1366
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,166
 And now that's been fulfilled.

1367
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,125
So I guess it's time for me to move on now!

1368
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,083
 Hey listen, I think then ..

1369
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,750
.. this is an important occasion for both of us.

1370
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:02,958
 Why don't we celebrate it!

1371
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,708
Even I feel as if examinations are over!

1372
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,875
 Tanya, tell me, do you like history?

1373
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,458
 Ya.

1374
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,833
You know there's a historic fort called Neemrana ..

1375
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:16,916
 ..a few hours from Delhi.

1376
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,083
Have you been there? - No.

1377
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,083
 Since you've never been there...

1378
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,708
...and more importantly, because you like history as well...

1379
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,291
 ...why don't we go there?

1380
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,166
 Okay!

1381
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,333
 Should we go this evening?

1382
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,291
 Like this!?

1383
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,000
 I'm so sorry!

1384
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,000
 Leave office early today.

1385
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:38,833
 You can go home and change.

1386
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,333
 Okay.

1387
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:43,166
After that, what time should I pick you up?

1388
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,916
 Actually, today I'll pick you up.

1389
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,458
 Say around 4 o'clock?

1390
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:51,958
 Okay.

1391
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,166
 Sounds good?

1392
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,000
Hi. - Hi.

1393
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,625
 Wow Tanya!

1394
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,250
 You're looking nice!

1395
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,708
 Do I need to say the same about you?

1396
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,500
 Shall we?

1397
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:38,916
 Itching to say one thing.

1398
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:40,583
 Should I?

1399
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,125
 Don't say: "Let's go, driver."

1400
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,375
 You drive well.

1401
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,666
 Tanya, we can be more informal...

1402
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,583
 "A brand new moment"

1403
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:15,625
 "Everything is changing in it"

1404
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,458
 "A beautiful milieu"

1405
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:23,208
 "A caravan of hope"

1406
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,708
 "Everything seems so wonderful"

1407
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,875
 "Joy is here and now"

1408
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:33,958
 "A sweet, tender feeling"

1409
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,958
 "As if someone dear is close by"

1410
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:42,583
 "A brand new moment"

1411
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:45,541
 "Everything is changing in it"

01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:48,458
 "A beautiful milieu"

1413
01:18:48,541 --> 01:18:54,541
 "A caravan of hope"

1414
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:21,166
 "The sky seems to be travelling"

1415
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:27,500

01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:33,458

01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:39,291

01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:42,500

1419
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,625
 "We're loving the present moment"

01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:48,583
 "The earth is spinning"

1421
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,708
 "We're loving the present moment"

1422
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,583
 "A brand new moment"

1423
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:57,625
 "Everything is changing in it"

1424
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:00,458
 "A beautiful milieu"

1425
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:06,875
 "A caravan of hope"

1426
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,250
 I think this car will miss you, Tanya!

1427
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:28,791
 I will miss it too!

1428
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,291
 Tanya, tell me something...

1429
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:36,458
If you get more money, will you still do this job?

1430
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,416
Grandpa has sent the bonus cheque home.

1431
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:46,250
I've gathered the amount of money I needed as start-up capital.

1432
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:49,708
So, I guess, money is not an incentive anymore.

1433
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,125
 Tanya I just..

1434
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,375
 Oh.. sorry..

1435
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,583
 Pick it up.

1436
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,416
 Hello.

1437
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,916
 Jasmeet!!

1438
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:06,916
 Hey sweetie! Where are you?

1439
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:08,916
 Upstairs!! Are you serious?

1440
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,375
 I will come in two minutes.

1441
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,708
 You just wait there!

1442
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:14,041
 Bye.

1443
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,166
That was Jasmeet, my best friend, my soulmate.

1444
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:19,916
When I was studying in college in Chandigarh, that's where we met.

1445
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,666
 We had so much in common...

1446
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,125
...infact we still do! We do everything together.

1447
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:26,708
Chilling together, going to the movies.

1448
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,166
 God, Jasmeet is so much fun!

1449
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,875
In fact, Jasmeet's facebook profile picture..

1450
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,958
..has a crazy photograph of the two of us.

1451
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,833
 We almost look like a married couple!

1452
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,541
 Jasmeet is like my soulmate!!

1453
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:40,875
Tanya, there's some really important work.

1454
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,291
I have to leave. - But you should come upstairs. It'll be so much fun!

1455
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:47,750
You can meet Jasmeet - I know, but I really have to go.

1456
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:50,958
Are you sure!? - Yeah.

1457
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,625
 Well...keep in touch!

1458
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,083
 I'll try.

1459
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,208
 Okay. Take care.

1460
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:04,958
 Bye.

01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:20,541

01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:31,333

1479
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:33,125
 "One doesn't know"

1480
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:36,291

01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,833
 "A surprise indeed life is."

1487
01:23:55,291 --> 01:24:00,166
 "A surprise indeed life is."

1488
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,291
 There's only one remorse.

1489
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:11,291
Not even once did we have coffee together.

1490
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:15,875
At least she should have given us her phone number.

1491
01:24:17,416 --> 01:24:20,666
No worries, we'll find her on Facebook.

1492
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,333
Yeah, tell me. - What dude!

1493
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,958
You are back to square one, after six months!

1494
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,791
 What do you mean?

1495
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,708
 Today morning Tanya came to the store.

1496
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,375
She said she would be leaving for Chandigarh today.

1497
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,291
 She was almost in tears.

1498
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,375
 Did you say something to her?

1499
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,791
 Why would I say anything to her?

1500
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,375
 And why did she come to your store?

1501
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:52,000
She wanted to introduce me to her friend Jasmeet..

1502
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:54,125
 ..who is an interior designer.

1503
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,958
Tanya thought I might be able to help Jasmeet.

1504
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:59,041
 Really!

1505
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:03,125
So how did you like her boyfriend, Jasmeet!?

1506
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:05,875
 Hey don't bend the gender, man!

1507
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,916
 It's her girlfriend, Jasmeet.

1508
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,083
 What!?

1509
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:13,541
 Yes, Jasmeet Kaur!

1510
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,291
 O no!

1511
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:17,541
 What happened?

1512
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,166
 Dude I've got to go!

1513
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:20,666
 I'll call you later.

1514
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:54,000
 Hi Pooja, this is Arjun.

1515
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,083
 Could you do me a favour?

1516
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,333
 Hello!

1517
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:26,083
 Snazzy suit!

1518
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,333
 Whose is it?

1519
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,041
 Uncle..

1520
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:31,083
 Since when did I become your uncle?

1521
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:32,750
 Call me Sir.

1522
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:36,000
Sir, the thing is that.. And yes, I should clarify one more thing...

1523
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:39,458
...if you've come here thinking that I will appoint you my driver...

1524
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:41,916
 ...then that's your delusion, Karan!

1525
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:46,958
Arjun. - O God, this Karan-Arjun!

1526
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:49,791
 See that's why!

1527
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:53,208
You get incensed at the slightest pretext. And how fragile are you!?

1528
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,791
One day you took us out for sightseeing in Delhi..

1529
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:56,625
..and landed up in hospital the next day!

1530
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:59,291
And on top of that, stuck that Granduncle onto us!

1531
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,958
 O hi! What a surprise!

1532
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,583
 You're looking dashing!

1533
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:05,541
Thank you! - You're looking nice too.

1534
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,375
Thank you. - Enough of these thank yous!

1535
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:11,291
Say what you're here to say and then be on your way!

1536
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:15,125
 Is Tanya there?

1537
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,958
 Tanya.. did you see?

1538
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,125
 No, she's gone to scale Mount Everest!

1539
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:22,958
I've told him so often to be more respectful to his elders..

1540
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,666
 ..and to his superiors!

1541
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,208
 Why don't you go inside!

1542
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:29,000
The match is at such a critical juncture. Go have a look at the score!

1543
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,125
Her travel agency hasn't yet started and the peon is already here!

1544
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:34,375
 Go now!

1545
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,750
 I'll just call her.

1546
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,708
 Thank you.

1547
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,750
 Hi!

1548
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:54,500
 Hi.

1549
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,625
You know, I had a friend in school named Ramanpreet.

1550
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:04,583
Anyone who'd call him for the first time would always say:

1551
01:28:05,291 --> 01:28:07,625
May I speak with Miss Ramanpreet, please!

1552
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,500
Some names are a bit confusing, you know!

1553
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,250
 Such a trivial thing!

1554
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,583
Don't you think you should have clarified!?

1555
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:19,875
 Tanya, till a few days ago..

1556
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:23,000
..I used to think that people are mere tools to help me reach my goal.

1557
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,541
 I had made myself into a machine.

1558
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:31,041
But today, I realized for the first time that I'm not a machine.

1559
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,125
I have a heart too, which has feelings..

1560
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:38,041
 ..very special feelings,

1561
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:40,416
 ..for a very special girl...

1562
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:44,666
A girl with whom I can find meaning in my life..

1563
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,125
..rather I can share my entire life with.

1564
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:54,500
And Tanya, after you left, I realised that that girl is you!

1565
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,500
 I really don't know what to say!

1566
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,750
 Tanya, so far, you've driven my car.

1567
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,333
Would you like to drive my life from now on?

1568
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:14,875
Yes! But first I want to start my travel agency.

1569
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,333
 And that too with my own money.

1570
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:17,708
 Absolutely.

1571
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:20,416
 And I will decide the car's speed!

1572
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:22,708
 Completely!

1573
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:24,333
 And the AC temperature as well!

1574
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:26,666
 18.5 won't do!?

1575
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:27,958
 Absolutely not!

1576
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,416
 Done!

1577
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,333
 Tanya, what are you doing!?

1578
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,708
Hope you haven't given a job to this pile-on!

1579
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:49,208
Uncle, meet Mr. Arjun Kapoor, my ex-boss.

1580
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:51,583
 We'll definitely meet your boss!

1581
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:54,541
But why have you made him wait outside? Call him inside!

1582
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:01,791
 He..

1583
01:30:02,416 --> 01:30:03,833
 Boss!!?

1584
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,333
 I've got to go! I call you later.

1585
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:13,750
 Oh no!

1586
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:17,291
 Tanya, you're so heartless!

1587
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,333
Should have at least informed us he's your boss.

1588
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:22,250
Poor thing, he had to face so much inconvenience because of us!

1589
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:26,541
But Aunty, you've always treated him very well!

1590
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,375
 I'm so embarrassed now!

1591
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:32,958
 Even I am also...

1592
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,500
 ...a little bit embarrassed!

1593
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:38,000
 Mr. Kapoor, oops Arjun ji!

1594
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,083
 I'd like to compliment you...

1595
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:44,583
...not on this card but on that authentic getup of yours!

1596
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:45,916
 Fantastic!

1597
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:51,583
I don't want to disappoint you, but I must tell you one thing...

1598
01:30:51,916 --> 01:30:55,458
...I'd recognised you on the first day itself!

1599
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:57,541
 Believe me, guys!

1600
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,083
After all, it's a matter of plain common sense!

1601
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:03,000
Only a tycoon can have so many credit cards!

1602
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,041
 I'd even told Sweety!

1603
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,541
 I'd told you, right!

1604
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,416
What!? - What!

1605
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,708
Perpetually stuck on your "whats" and "ifs"!

1606
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:14,416
 She is very forgetful!

1607
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,708
 Anyways, Arjun ji...

1608
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:22,041
Sir, I mean...I really want to say one thing.

1609
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,541
 With your permission, that is!

 Uncle, it's your rightful due!

1611
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,791
