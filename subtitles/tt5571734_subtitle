1
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,390
Careful-careful-careful!

2
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,322
Walk straight...
- Watch out!

3
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,688
Come on, start the car.

4
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,432
Drive slowly...avoid the bumps.

5
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,134
Dumpy! Huh!

6
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,236
Will this lead to a police case?
- No-no.

7
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,422
But we won't spare those girls.
Look at what they did.

8
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,239
Listen - are you feeling sleepy?

9
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:03,746
No ma'am.

10
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,107
Want me to sit with you and chat?

11
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,572
Minal, don't!

12
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,481
Falak, he'll bang into someone.
- Minal, please.

13
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,109
Please, don't.

14
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,642
Just drive.

15
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,418
Falak.

16
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,121
Hold him.
- Yeah.

17
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,531
Hurry UP-

18
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,206
Stop right here, on the left.

19
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,430
I kept on saying let's leave...

20
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,529
Was constantly hinting at it

21
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,374
What if something happens to him how?

22
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,676
Sir... Sir...

23
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,181
How's he now?

24
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,721
He has a head injury.

25
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,283
Requires an MRI.
- Any damage to his eyes?

26
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,052
We removed the glass
shards from his eyes.

27
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,502
By the way,
would you like to do a MLC report?

28
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,004
MLC'?
- Legal procedure. <i>. .</i> Police.

29
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,444
Sir... - No-no-no... right now
let's just focus on the patient.

30
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,069
Are you sure?

31
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,636
Yeah. Please focus on the patient.

32
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,579
Please.

33
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,132
Yeah... Hello, Ankit.

34
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,636
Listen ...There was an incident.

35
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,435
In Surajkund.

36
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,199
Rajvir is hurt.

37
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,734
He needed stitches.
He was bleeding.

38
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,239
I...l am sending you our location.

39
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,713
Maybe you could speak to
the Home Secretary...

40
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,387
Consider it done.
- Thank you.

41
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,627
Thank you.

42
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,660
Finish your tea.

43
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,361
Bhandari - Sir.

44
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,669
What happened yesterday?

45
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,761
We don't know for sure, sir.

46
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,740
Call him.

47
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,423
Who is it?
- Uncle.

48
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,206
Hello, uncle.

49
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,239
Ankit here

50
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,502
Yeah...get Viru on the phone.

51
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,639
Well...Rajvir can't talk now.

52
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,083
Yeah...it happened on Sunday night.

53
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,082
Stitches?

54
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,389
Yes. . ..couple of them.

55
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,094
Any injury to the eye?
- Yeah yeah... aah well

56
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,530
We'll know once the
bandages are taken off.

57
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,067
Who were they?

58
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,201
Who?

59
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,799
Well...

60
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,130
Uncle. ..you know, aah...

61
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,175
Don't worry, uncle.
The situation is under control.

62
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:46,746
Yeah...

63
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,547
I'll tell him to call you back.

64
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,086
Yes...I'll tell him.

65
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,329
How was your day?
- Hi.

66
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,334
Good.

67
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,496
You had dinner?
- I am so hungry.

68
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,798
What do you want to eat?

69
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,556
What?

70
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,659
What is it?

71
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,118
Hello
- Hello, uncle.

72
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,461
Don't you own flat no.
203 at Sarva Priya Vihar?

73
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,161
Yeah... but who is this?

74
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,329
What is the matter?

75
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,669
Well...it is about your tenants

76
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,642
...tell those girls to
settle the rent and shift out.

77
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,303
What are you getting at son.

78
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,643
What am I getting at?!

79
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,378
I am just saying
- they are not decent girls.

80
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,977
Just throw them out

81
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,186
Listen I know them pretty well.

82
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,282
They've been living there
for more than 2 years now.

83
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,987
I understand...

84
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,687
But you don't get it, do you?

85
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,555
That's all I am saying,
did you understand Mr. Kasturilal?

86
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,260
Hello! Hello!

87
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,494
Coffee?

88
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,101
I'm going to take a bath.

89
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,636
There's no point in
avoiding the conversation.

90
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,349
What's done is done.

91
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,483
I am sure they have moved on,
we should move on too.

92
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,318
It is not that simple Minal.

93
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,452
His eye...

94
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,124
And...this can lead
to a criminal complaint.

95
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,558
Are we going to think about this
everyday and worry ourselves to death?

96
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,602
We'll go mad like this.

97
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,099
She's right.
Let's just forget the whole thing.

98
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,706
Will they forget it?

99
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,019
It's been four days since
anyone has even smiled here.

100
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,377
Fine, go ahead. Smile.

101
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,622
Smile, Andrea.

102
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,588
Should I?
- Yes...

103
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,458
Sure?
- Yeah...laugh.

104
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,999
Feel free. Laugh.

105
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:02,555
Are you sure?

106
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,600
Absolutely - Look,
don't yell at me later.

107
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,068
I won't...Go right ahead.

108
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:07,570
You'll join in.

109
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,336
Come on...

110
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,233
Don't do it.

111
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,711
Your turn Andrea
- No, don't...

112
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,581
Hello, uncle.

113
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,686
Just a second please.

114
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,394
It is Mr. Kasturilal
- l-low come'?

115
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,504
So uncle, what brings you
here today... - Just like that.

116
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,373
Why? Am I not allowed in here?

117
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,309
We didn't meant that

118
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,075
In fact, I like making this sugary
watery, apology of a tea for you.

119
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,380
Is everything okay, dear?

120
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,551
Yes...

121
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,351
Sure?

122
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:06,519
Why are you asking?
- Well...did something happen?

123
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,159
What?
- No...

124
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,999
ls someone troubling you...

125
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,164
...in person or making
calls at odd hours?

126
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,169
No, uncle... - There's
been no such thing...

127
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,139
So is everything okay?
- Yes, uncle...

128
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,080
Absolutely.

129
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,418
So...may I take your leave then?
- Yeah...

130
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,456
See you again on the 7th
for the rent then! - Sure!

131
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,657
God bless!

132
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,633
Bye uncle.

133
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,705
How did he know'?

134
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,106
I have no idea.

135
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:14,290
Will the cheque be issued
in the name of the trust? - Yes.

136
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,499
I wish...you had a nominee!!!

137
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,178
Yeah that would have been nice.

138
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,340
Think about it then.

139
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,050
I am ready...even now.

140
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,573
Stop. Stop-

141
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,650
Uncle...
- It's okay...he's fine.

142
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,343
Come on, uncle. Get up.

143
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,485
Are you hurt?

144
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,690
You're hurt!

145
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,090
Someone get him some water.

146
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,688
Who was that guy on the bike?

147
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,663
He just knocked you
down and sped away.

148
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,493
I am fine, son.

149
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,794
This thing has just been junked.

150
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,730
Have some water...I'll
take care of the scooter.

151
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,100
Don't worry about it.

152
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,473
Are you sure you are okay?
- Yes, fine.

153
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,136
Get a rickshaw for him. Come on.

154
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,312
Auto.

155
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,205
Amar Colony.

156
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,372
You are at Amar Colony, right?

157
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,446
Amar Colony... - Amar Colony
is walking distance...

158
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,680
Who asked you Smarty?

159
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,220
Why don't you take another rickshaw?

160
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,747
Shithead - Have a heart
- it's a hit-n-run case.

161
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,289
Take care uncle.

162
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,221
Just one more thing
...do what we discussed.

163
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,500
The thing over the phone...

164
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,428
...Remember?

165
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,003
Just ask those
girls to vacate your house!

166
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,373
In fact, do it today.

167
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,111
They are trouble.

168
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:15,484
They quarreled
over rates with my buddies.

169
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,553
One of my friends got hurt badly...

170
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,616
Just throw them out, okay.

171
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,684
I'll call you back.

172
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,319
Please!

173
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:29,765
Let's go

174
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,260
Here you go

175
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,668
Your bag

176
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,536
Move

177
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,073
Hello

178
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,675
Yes, Mr. Kasturilal

179
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,143
He had called earlier also

180
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,115
That guy
- I couldn't bring myself to...

181
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,519
But he was saying throw them out
- they are no good

182
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,320
I didn't want you kids
to worry but then...

183
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,060
When I was on my way back...

184
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,364
A biker knocked me down.

185
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,766
And then they came pretending
to help but warned me again

186
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,035
What's happening, dear?
I just don't understand.

187
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,143
I'll call you back, Mr. Kasturilal.
I'll tell you everything.

188
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,149
Are you okay though?

189
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,286
Yes, dear. I am fine.
But just tell me what's going on?

190
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,419
I'll tell you everything,
I'll call you right back.

191
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,252
Sure, dear.

192
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,022
You should be careful.

193
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,216
Stop here.

194
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,153
I don't believe this, Falak.

195
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,295
Everything happened so quickly,
we thought...

196
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,064
No you just didn't think, Falak.

197
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,397
We thought...

198
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,139
If you really had given it a thought...

199
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,574
...you would've never
gone with them, Falak.

200
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,335
Alone... to their room.

201
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,372
Weird idea of having fun

202
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,540
I can understand
Minal doing this, but...

203
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,147
What do you mean? Minal doing this?

204
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,585
Look, Falak...l can either
be truthful or liberal.

205
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,993
What do you want me to be?

206
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,701
I didn't come here for a discussion
on the right or wrong of it.

207
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,598
I came because I
just wanted to be held...

208
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,082
What did the doctor say?

209
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,754
Viru?

210
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,416
Can't you see for yourself?

211
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,524
What's the doctor going to say anyway?

212
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,758
Once I lay my hands on
that Minal... - We will get her.

213
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:50,726
Shouldn't be difficult!

214
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,466
Just wait and watch.

215
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,469
Why are you always so aggro?
- Point being?

216
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,436
You weren't even there!

217
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,098
So.
- Stop provoking Rajvir them.

218
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,268
Pussy! - This isn't
about being machol.

219
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,242
Vishwa, shut up! Why?

220
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,438
Why are you always so shit scared?

221
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,175
Stop the car...l want to talk to them.

222
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,147
About what?

223
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,274
Shut him up first.

224
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:16,749
Hello.

225
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:19,721
Minal - Who is this?

226
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,256
How does it matter?
- Meaning? Who is this?

227
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,628
I mean...the issue
is you hurt my friend.

228
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,434
He's going to lose an eye...and
you're going to pay for it.

229
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,370
How...l am sorry...

230
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,178
...but the thing is...
the situation

231
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,116
Shut up...you started everything.

232
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,676
No one forced you...
you came there on your own...decked up.

233
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,184
So...l mean yeah... I... I got angry.

234
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,492
Really? But now he's angry.
And I am angry.

235
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,793
So we'll have some fun with you.
Get ready to be humiliated.

236
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,030
I see...then stop threatening
me over the phone.

237
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,230
Try it in person then we'll talk!

238
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,000
Trouble is - If I do show up...
you'll beg me to go away.

239
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,977
I am bored you coward.

240
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,315
So stop talking and come
and show me what you can do.

241
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,176
Hello?

242
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,345
Hello?

243
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,555
Agree! She does ask for it!

244
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,623
So we will deliver!

245
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,285
It is going to be fun!

246
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,136
You could've taken my calls.

247
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,775
Or sent me a text
- I didn't want to bother you.

248
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,215
But I just couldn't
think straight today...

249
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:52,082
...so I thought maybe if I
talk to you I'll get some clarity.

250
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,250
You guys are already...

251
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,583
...doing the right thing.

252
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,456
Don't be apologetic

253
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,265
And Minal should go right ahead
and file a complaint with the cops.

254
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,404
What?
- They are here.

255
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,638
Who's here?
- They are here...we've to go.

256
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,044
Let's go.
- Okay-okay.

257
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,016
Not only did they call.

258
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,019
But they've also incited Sinha and
Gupta from the resident association...

259
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,122
...to ask you guys to leave.

260
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,192
But you don't need to worry.

261
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,125
You can continue living there .

262
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,429
If the entire managing
committee objects

263
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,665
...what will you do?

264
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,674
We'll cross the bridge
when we come to it

265
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,409
I feel ...you guys should do something.

266
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,740
File a complaint with the police.

267
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,739
Uncle, we don't want
to escalate this matter.

268
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,021
What's wrong?
It was a very good show.

269
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,388
People are waiting
outside to meet you.

270
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:40,560
Hurry UP-

271
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,225
Sis...
- Huh!

272
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,361
Nothing.

273
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,100
I'll come.

274
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,067
Come soon.

275
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,009
Minal, is everything ok'?

276
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,648
You seem very off today?

277
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,692
It is such a mess, isn't it?

278
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,088
You don't know how well
connected these guys are.

279
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,089
And...you all are girls after all.

280
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:23,969
I mean...if this thing goes on,
who will be more humiliated?

281
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,175
There's no need for this.

282
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,703
Let's compromise.

283
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:35,116
Look I'll be with him tomorrow.
Call up and apologise.

284
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,118
...even if you don't mean it.

285
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,645
Just say 'sorry' and end it here.

286
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,652
Move on.

287
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,096
Let's just finish it here.

288
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:04,447
So madam... the incident took
place in Surajkund, right? - Yes.

289
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,181
Then you need to file the case there

290
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,577
But the threatening
calls have been made here.

291
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,712
...Sure you want to file
a case against them? - Yes.

292
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,515
Look, once we start investigating

293
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,392
...you have no idea
what it will lead to?

294
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,321
Your routine will go for a toss

295
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,265
I mean...if you file a report...

296
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,325
...you'll have to come down
to the police station every day.

297
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,331
The boy must
have bled a lot though.

298
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,501
So... even he has a case.

299
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:36,769
...Anyway let me take it down.
- Sir, why don't you just give them a warning?

300
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,639
We can warn them, of course.

301
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,547
But she will be charged too.

302
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,609
You assaulted him madam.

303
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,379
Right?

304
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:50,253
And if we file an FIR...
then everyone will know,

305
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,727
that you were drunk too... right?

306
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,257
Sir...
- Quiet!

307
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,697
Yes, madam. Sorry.

308
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,501
Go ahead.

309
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,407
But the threats on the phone...

310
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:13,348
Don't worry about the
threats...it means nothing.

311
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,513
Thank God...

312
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,178
In fact I am so happy that...

313
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,277
...nothing happened to you that night.

314
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,616
You're absolutely safe.

315
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,717
What if something had happened...

316
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,356
You know what,
I am actually quite upset with you.

317
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,256
A decent girl like you...

318
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,298
...doesn't go outwith such boys!

319
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,729
Does she?

320
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,295
You went into the room...you had fun...

321
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,067
...cracked jokes...drank...

322
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,803
You asked for it...

323
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,371
But later the feminist
brigade comes after us!

324
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,572
Candle marches and all...!

325
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,276
And claim girls are not safe.

326
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:54,587
Look I've a suggestion...
sleep over it tonight.

327
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,290
Take her advice... she looks
experienced in such matters .

328
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,262
Please help her out, madam.

329
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,295
And we are always here to help.

330
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,138
Some more tea? ...No? Soda?

331
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,771
This is absurd.

332
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,271
You should've talked to me before.

333
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,348
I thought everything will
be fine after a while but...

334
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,319
One sec

335
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,157
Hello.

336
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:33,620
Pradeep.

337
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,329
L-low are you'?

338
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,326
I am fine, thank you.

339
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,570
Listen, who's ACP South?

340
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,302
Actually, you didn't file
a FIR in Surajkund that day.

341
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,210
So now we can lodge
a zero FIR in New Delhi.

342
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,712
Okay?

343
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,772
Okay, sir, but then what'?...

344
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,575
Once you lodge this,
I will put pressure on them.

345
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,355
We'll see to it that the boys stop.

346
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,554
Not to worry, relax.

347
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,986
You went ahead and
filed a police complaint.

348
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,327
And didn't even check with us?

349
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,730
Was it for you to make that decision?

350
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,530
Don't you know how
the oops work Minal'?

351
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,498
Can we trust them?

352
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,308
And can Vishwa and company be trusted?

353
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,271
Look Falak you know what
these guys are capable of...

354
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,607
That's why.

355
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,308
I want to end this, but you guys...

356
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,042
So what should I do? Tell me.

357
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,717
Take my complaint back? Apologise?

358
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,021
Fall at their feet?
Tell me what to do?

359
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:38,153
Minal, ...why are we here'?

360
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,756
For world...

361
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,157
To lead a normal life!

362
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,229
Not to get involved
with some police business.

363
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,425
If my dad finds out about this...

364
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,603
He's going to be so tensed...

365
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:57,737
Look, I don't want to apologisel?

366
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,672
Fine, I'll do it!

367
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,307
They threatened Andrea...

368
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,045
...who knows what they can do tomorrow.

369
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,620
And all this nonsense will stop?!

370
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:09,089
I think we shouldn't compromise, I...
- Minal, please...

371
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,224
Please don't complicate things.

372
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,726
I'm calling Vishwa tomorrow
and putting an end to this.

373
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,265
She was in tears.

374
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,707
She apologised also
- Very good.

375
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,109
Good beginning.

376
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,407
The end will be even better.

377
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,640
You rattled her enough

378
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,181
What else do you want?

379
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,547
Should I say...
- Dude, what's your problem ya...

380
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,607
You weren't even present.

381
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,278
If I was - this would
never have happened.

382
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,343
And

383
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,185
I am just following traditions.

384
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,249
One needs to show women their place.

385
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,526
You don't want to end this?
Should I say no? - Yes.

386
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,692
You don't want an apology?

387
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,800
It's Falak.

388
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,272
Should I answer?

389
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,306
Hello...Vishwa...Hi!

390
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,004
Falak.
- Yeah, Falak.

391
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:08,676
You'd said...that we could
work out a compromise... - Yeah.

392
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,980
Viru's right here...

393
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,048
See, Falak...

394
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,351
I don't have any issues with you.

395
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,416
Where is Minal
- Rajvir.

396
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,759
Look...whatever happened that day,
it was in the heat of the moment.

397
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,126
Can we just...
- I thought I told you...

398
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,266
I don't have a problem with you

399
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,327
Don't interfere...
give Minal the phone

400
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah, but I had already
spoken to Vishwa, we'll

401
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,445
Falak, where is that ***** Minal,
I want her to apologise.

402
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,105
Period!

403
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,477
Rajvir, please...

404
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,750
Please don't talk like that.

405
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,186
Look...don't lecture me on morality.

406
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,483
Get that ***** on the line, now!

407
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:55,628
Don't you get it ...l don't
have a problem with you.

408
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,461
But I do!

409
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,565
With you, with your language...
with your filthy mind.

410
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,566
What do you think?
That we called you out of fear...

411
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,668
Minal should have
hurt both your eyes.

412
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,371
You just wait and watch now.

413
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,436
You'll be rotting in prison soon!

414
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,010
You sure it's her number?
- Yeahhh...

415
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,119
Ma'am, the boss wants
to see you. - OK.

416
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,432
Yes, sir.
- Sorry...

417
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,070
This is awkward...

418
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,750
Look Falak,
we're an image-conscious company.

419
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,552
And my boss, Tushar Singhal
has just... - I don't Know...

420
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,995
I don't know whose...

421
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,999
I understand... but
with this merger...

422
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,035
I don't know about this.

423
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,330
Look, Why don't you...

424
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,132
Take a few days off...
go on a leave.

425
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:51,112
And...you know,
look for prospects...

426
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,306
This is...

427
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,481
You know how it is.

428
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,351
Yes, sir.
I do know how it is.

429
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:15,264
Sir...can you please ask
the accounts to clear my dues?

430
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,698
I'll do that.

431
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,501
Don't let go.

432
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,129
Hold her. Hold her.

433
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,708
You made a mistake! You
shouldn't have gone to the cops.

434
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,418
Listen...

435
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:46,224
Deer Park...back gate...20 meters,
going North.

436
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,363
I got it...North...South...

437
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,524
l-low many times are you
going to repeat the same thing'?

438
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,292
You don't even have
the registration number?

439
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,495
But I described the vehicle.

440
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,468
Yes, and we have
forwarded that info.

441
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,336
But we haven't found any such car.

442
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,675
She's cold

443
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,115
Go ahead... call for help.

444
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,017
Help! Help!

445
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,214
Help! Help!

446
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,494
Listen to me...

447
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,431
Now why're you begging'?

448
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,730
Remember the challenging
tone over the phone?

449
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,506
Let me go!

450
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,372
Dumpy... I won't report this.

451
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,208
Just let me go, I'll
forget everything - I see.

452
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,377
But I want you to remember this.

453
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,044
You should realise what you've done.

454
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,323
Let me go, please...l am sorry.

455
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,450
Leave me...
- No-no-no-no...

456
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,155
No, you're not sorry,
you're a proud *****.

457
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,699
Yeah... who wants to go first?

458
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,328
Hello - will your over-efficient
police do something now? Amod.

459
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,601
Or should I step
out after taking my meds?

460
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,071
Deepak... Sehgal!

461
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,238
North... they abducted her
headed North

462
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,680
I am sorry.

463
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,738
North, yes...

464
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,752
Back gate...going North.
- Yeah...l got it.

465
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:18,782
North, I got it.

466
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,147
Let me go, please

467
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,713
Please...

468
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,282
You guys are so stuck up...

469
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,158
***** you got a coin on you?

470
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,696
Dumpy, pat her down!

471
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,706
Deepak, we checked with Hauz Khas,
Saket and all the other police stations.

472
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,409
No such incident has been reported.

473
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,589
Let me go.

474
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,286
Go slow man, what's the hurry?

475
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,288
She's getting turned on,
we don't want her to have fun.

476
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,230
We want revenge.

477
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,293
Let me go.

478
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,302
Stop the car!

479
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,470
Let me go!

480
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,171
Don't tell anyone about this...

481
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,613
This was just a curtain raiser!

482
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,314
Okay?

483
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,145
Catch you later.

484
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,687
Now get out!

485
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,203
Where were you?

486
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,349
Minal'?

487
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,478
Minal, what's wrong'?

488
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,218
Falak.

489
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,088
Minal.

490
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,485
Are you okay'?

491
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,093
Minal.

492
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,256
Minal.

493
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,666
What happened?

494
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,066
Are you okay'?

495
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:14,761
Minal.

496
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,333
Are you okay'?

497
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,764
Get a towel
- quick!.

498
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,304
Minal. Come and sit here.

499
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,507
Come and sit here.

500
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,009
Take off your jacket.

501
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,390
Are you okay'?

502
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,148
Just one option left.

503
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,320
Let's leave this place.

504
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,493
Yes, Shaukeen
- Jai Hind, sir.

505
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,371
Sir, we just received
a harassment complaint.

506
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,770
So we will have to investigate.

507
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,169
Fine, go ahead, what's the problem?

508
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,011
...it is against
Ranjit Singh's nephew!!!

509
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,747
The guy from South Delhi?
- Yes.

510
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,248
I'll call you back.
- Jai Hind, sir.

511
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,215
Sir, this is JCP Amod...

512
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,154
Sir, someone's filed a complaint

513
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,058
...against Ranjit Singh's
nephew in Surajkund.

514
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,066
Molestation.

515
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,495
Right, sir.

516
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,698
Where did this happen?
- Surajkund!

517
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,443
Who all were there?
- Me, Vishwa and Dumpy.

518
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,047
What about him?

519
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,207
He was with you in Patiala.

520
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,384
And the girls?

521
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,226
One's from Delhi,
another's from Lucknow...

522
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,156
...And the third from
Arunachal or maybe Sikkim.

523
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,290
You mean the north-east.

524
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,157
Leave.

525
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,629
Viru, stay.

526
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,605
Grow up!

527
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,013
Stop hanging around with these kids!

528
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,741
Does a Minal Arora stay here'?
- Yes. Second floor!

529
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,656
We're from Surajkund Police Station.

530
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,155
Yes?

531
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,161
So has our FIR been filed?
- Which one of you is Minal?

532
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,491
Me!

533
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,063
Follow me
- Why?

534
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,331
S.H.O ma'am wants to speak with you.

535
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,561
Let us talk here.

536
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,331
But she's downstairs!!!

537
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,600
Don't just stand there, let's go.

538
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,539
I'll be right back.

539
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,305
No wait!

540
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,573
Just let go of my arm.

541
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,673
Fine...

542
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,084
Minal Arora'?
- Yes.

543
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,083
You need to come with us.

544
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,384
Ma'am, let's go up and talk.

545
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,015
No.

546
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,320
What is the problem?
- Get in.

547
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,359
We've a warrant to take her in.

548
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,557
Mukesh - She's been charged
under section 307. 'Attempt to Murder'.

549
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,065
And we've been searching
for her for a week.

550
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:05,532
What?

551
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,263
But we... we filed the complaint.

552
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,099
She's been charged
under section 307.

553
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,536
We'll talk at the
police station - No...

554
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,503
But we...

555
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,599
We just want to talk.

556
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,506
I haven't done anything...

557
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,976
We filed the complaint.

558
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,639
No, but...
- We just want to talk.

559
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,281
Where are you taking me?

560
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,387
Come to Surajkund Police Station...
- Where are you taking her?

561
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,222
Minal...

562
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,135
This is bound to happen
if you let such girls rent out.

563
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,495
Excuse me...

564
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,401
You had said that the
S.H.O will be here by 11

565
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,435
It's 12 now.

566
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,604
We'll inform you once she's here.

567
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,470
But can we...
- Please wait outside

568
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,207
Yes, dear...l am here

569
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,511
Where are you?

570
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,580
Madam is going to be late.

571
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,181
You can't sit here after 6 pm.

572
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,024
But... how long are
you going to hold her'?

573
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,153
Let me see her once.

574
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,198
Stop wasting your time, madam.

575
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,664
There's nothing you can do here.

576
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,598
Go and arrange for the bail instead.

577
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,637
It's 8:30 already... who knows
whether she's coming at all.

578
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,236
Uncle, you should go.

579
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,474
We'll wait.

580
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,981
But dear... how can I just leave'?

581
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,476
She's... she is here.

582
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:06,577
Come.

583
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,189
Ma'am, can we please...

584
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,087
Rajesh, let them meet her for a bit.

585
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,225
Thank you, ma'am
- Thank you.

586
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,399
Minu...

587
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,677
Are you okay, dear?
- Papa...

588
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,645
Go home.

589
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:40,379
Please Papa, go home.

590
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,419
What are they saying?

591
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:51,126
They say we should apply for bail.

592
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,561
We already showed her the warrant.

593
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,605
Your daughter's been charged
for 'Attempt to Murder'.

594
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,437
What if the boy had died?

595
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,279
By the way, she's a prostitute,
I hope you know that.

596
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,618
What crap?
- Shut up.

597
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,549
Or I'll have you thrown out.

598
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,682
They won't admit it but
they are the co-accused.

599
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:21,462
Here's your copy of the FIR.

600
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,509
I told you to be careful.

601
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,105
Where's the paper?
- What paper?

602
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,544
Paper... the copy of the complaint...

603
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,051
Yeah but why do you want it?

604
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,320
I just want to...

605
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,590
What is the charge?
Show me the complaint?

606
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,499
<i>So... Minal...</i>

607
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,501
...is at the police station,
and you're Falak...

608
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,571
...And she's Andrea.

609
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:47,411
Charges are section 320 with 324...

610
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,109
...causing grievous injury.

611
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,812
Section 307... Attempt to Murder!

612
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,580
Attempt to Extort and Prostitution.

613
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,528
They took her in on a Friday so she
that doesn't get bail immediately.

614
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,461
We can't get bail anyway...

615
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,396
They said it's a
non-bailable of fence - Pen...

616
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:06,999
You got a pen'?

617
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,211
Hire a lawyer... on Saturday.

618
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,473
And tell him to go to
the Session judge's home...

619
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,573
...and put in an emergency bail plea.

620
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,742
Yes, emergency bail plea.

621
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:28,681
By the way... women
and minors can get bail...

622
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,648
For a non-bailable of fence.

623
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:32,549
Yes.

624
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,166
Falak...

625
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,268
Take a look at this!

626
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,022
Not possible... not possible at all.

627
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:03,989
Mr. Kumar?

628
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,993
Hold on... hold on a minute.

629
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:06,653
Yes ma'am.

630
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,457
I told you to come on Monday.

631
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,155
It will be done.

632
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,221
I'll help you get bail on Monday.

633
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,560
Will you get it done on Monday?
- And don't forget... - Of course.

634
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,660
And you do have my number!
- Yes.

635
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:20,741
Minal.

636
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:21,771
Come on.

637
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:22,635
Get in.

638
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,605
Come on, shut the door.

639
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:33,010
Minal... we've met another lawyer.

640
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,078
We'll get you out by Monday.

641
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,455
That place reeks of urine, Falak.

642
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,558
I feel pukish all the time

643
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,193
They were using a legal term.

644
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:25,271
Consultation... Conference...
- Blocking fees.

645
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,308
Yes-yes-yes, sir.

646
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,374
So everyone has refused.

647
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:35,444
But there is a lawyer who
is willing to represent us - Who?

648
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,278
Some Kumar!

649
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,224
So what do we do?

650
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,721
Mr. Sehgal...

651
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,193
...we are very scared.

652
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,298
I've never seen Minal
so helpless before.

653
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,476
She's a very brave girl.

654
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,415
Mr. Sehgal...

655
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,685
...will she make bail?

656
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,181
We're normal working girls,
Mr. Sehgal.

657
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,170
They are insane...

658
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,772
What?

659
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:54,043
I am on medication.

660
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,752
I can't handle this...

661
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,657
...this trial.

662
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,994
What trial?

663
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,236
You're running a temperature

664
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,443
Madam! Madam!

665
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,247
Who is it, Andrea?

666
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,502
Getting bail was the
least of your worries.

667
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,369
We must prepare for
the trial properly, here...

668
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,305
Sign this affidavit

669
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,181
Thank you.

670
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,623
The hearing is on the 15th.

671
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,129
You all must be ready.

672
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,680
Silence please!

673
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,511
Please stand!

674
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,176
Case no. 541; State Vs. Minal Arora!

675
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,620
Prosecution may proceed.

676
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,715
Sir...

677
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,989
A few of our key laws
were passed to protect...

678
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,461
...our women from repression

679
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,622
And some...

680
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,759
...existing laws were strengthened.

681
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,493
For example, the laws against
rape, dowry... etc etc!

682
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,762
Unfortunately...

683
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,168
...some women have
now begun misusing them

684
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,575
...targeting innocent, decent men.

685
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,739
Resorting to blackmail
and extortion.

686
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,649
And that's precisely what
has happened in this case as well.

687
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,314
On the night of March 1st,
Minal Arora and others...

688
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,354
...met Rajvir Singh and
his friends at a Rock Concert...

689
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,753
...and tried to be friendly.

690
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:20,757
Later...when Rajvir Singh invited
them over to RS resort for dinner...

691
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:24,294
...in good faith, they...

692
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,195
...offered to establish sexual relations
with the boys in exchange of money.

693
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,535
At first Rajvir was intimidated
and later he clearly refused.

694
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,437
Minal threatened...

695
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,739
...to get him arrested on false
charges of rape unless he paid up.

696
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,712
But Rajvir still refused.

697
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,208
That's when Minal attacked him.

698
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,616
The attack was totally
unprovoked and vicious.

699
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:50,580
Later she fled from the scene
of crime along with her friends.

700
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,493
Sir, this is clearly a case
of 'Attempt to Extort', 'Soliciting

701
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,429
...under Section 320
to be read with 324...

702
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:02,732
...and 'Causing grievous injury' and
under section 307 'Attempt to Murder'.

703
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,535
And that is all... your honor.

704
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,039
M r. Deepak.

705
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:12,137
Mr.Sehgal.

706
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:18,648
Yes, your honor.
- Opening arguments, please.

707
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,422
Sir, let me make it clear
the police has no case...

708
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,790
Mr.Deepak, can you...
please speak louder?

709
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,323
Sir, I was saying...

710
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:36,166
...the police has no case,
it's a case of vindictive litigation.

711
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:38,705
The actual charges
that can be made are..

712
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:43,107
...section 354 'Outraging
the modesty of a woman'...

713
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:46,670
...Rajvir Singh did that
to my client Minal Arora...

714
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,080
...in Surajkund's RS Resort.

715
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:53,314
But the Police acted under
Rajvir Singh's influence...

716
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,456
...ignored my client Minal
Arora's complaint and...

717
01:01:56,512 --> 01:02:03,259
...filed a charge sheet against her on
the basis of Rajvir Singh's complaint.

718
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,566
The second charge is section
503 to be read with 506.

719
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,229
'Criminal Intimidation.'

720
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,567
These boys were
constantly threatening...

721
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,601
...and intimidating my
client ever since that incident.

722
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:23,709
And in order to hide their crimes,
they committed two more.

723
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,083
Section 340 'Wrongful Confinement'.

724
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:32,089
Ankit Malhotra and Raunak Anand aka
Dumpy, along with two of their friends...

725
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,718
...held my client
inside a car...and raped...

726
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,228
I mean, molested her.

727
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,759
Anything else?
- Sir'?

728
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,727
Is that all?
- Yes, sir.

729
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,364
Mr. Parashant?

730
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:45,234
First I would like to call upon the
investigating officer... Sarla Premchand.

731
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,242
On what basis did you file
the final charge sheet, officer?

732
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,036
Sir, I had received the
complaint from the boys long ago.

733
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,344
Being a lady officer,
and since this case involved women...

734
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:56,610
...I chose to do a detailed
investigation instead...

735
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,652
...of taking direct action
- Right.

736
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,052
And I found out that these girls...

737
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,021
...were present at RS
Resort during the incident.

738
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,049
But I didn't find any
substance in their FIR

739
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,595
So why didn't you arrest
Ms. Arora immediately?

740
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,062
Sir, she was absconding.

741
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,689
So, without a confession from her...

742
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:15,065
...how did you conclude that
she was the one who assaulted Rajvir?

743
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,229
When we carried out an
investigation after the complaint...

744
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,569
...the manager and waiter from
the resort testified against her.

745
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,300
Right.

746
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,242
Did you recover the bottle used
in the assault? - Yes, sir.

747
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,345
Exhibit 'PW 1/1', sir.

748
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:30,177
Minal Arora's fingerprints are on it.

749
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,280
That's all.

750
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:37,350
Mr. Deepak, would you like to
cross-examine her? - No, your honor.

751
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,789
I would immediately
like to call upon Dr. Uday!

752
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,064
L-low intense was the attack'?

753
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,393
If the bottle hadn't shattered...

754
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,196
...the blunt-force trauma would've
probably killed Rajvir Singh.

755
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,528
It was quite a deep cut.

756
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,265
The bottle was swung
at him with a lot of force.

757
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,102
If the glass shards had pierced
a critical artery or thereabout...

758
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,372
...Then Rajvir
could've lost his life?

759
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:58,173
Yes.

760
01:03:58,534 --> 01:03:59,706
That's all, your honor.

761
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:03,273
Mr.Deepak, cross?
- No cross, your honor.

762
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,746
In order to prove my point,
I would like to call upon...

763
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,455
...Mukesh Kumar, a waiter at RS Resort.

764
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:13,617
Is she the one who
attacked Rajvir? - Yes.

765
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,117
Can you describe the series of events?

766
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:18,597
Well, at first they
all looked calm and relaxed.

767
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,497
They were chatting and laughing.

768
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,169
But one look at their
clothes and body language...

769
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,103
...and I told the manager that
these are no respectable couples...

770
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,196
And that he should ask them to leave.

771
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,366
Or they won't leave before dawn.

772
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,601
Such girls... - But I was
wearing normal clothes.

773
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,304
Do not speak out of turn!

774
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,775
No, but you can't guess such
things just from people's clothes.

775
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,179
Why else would they go
with the boys to their rooms?

776
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,253
Think about it.

777
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,519
And what's more, each girl
was going alone with a different guy.

778
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,423
Who went first?
- The one with the specs

779
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:50,293
But sir, I just went to
use the washroom... - Mr. Sehgal.

780
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,355
Please explain court
procedure to your clients.

781
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:54,759
What happened next?

782
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,163
A little later I suddenly
heard screaming and yelling.

783
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,399
When I went to take a look,
she was running away...

784
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:03,274
...and this gentleman's face was covered
in blood - That's all, your honor.

785
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,112
Mr. Deepak
- No cross, your honor.

786
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,180
Sir...

787
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,549
Why aren't you questioning anyone?

788
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,108
Next I would like to call
upon manager Ramakant Vijay.

789
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:16,188
When you were
entertaining your guests...

790
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,454
...at the restaurant, what
did you hear Minal telling Rajvir'?

791
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,029
Sir, how can I repeat such
things in front of so many people'?

792
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,563
I can understand your hesitation.

793
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,124
But the court doesn't have
that much time. So please be quick.

794
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,398
Sir, they were talking
about... doing things...

795
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:31,494
...that boys and girls do in private.

796
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,131
I happened to be near the table
when I overheard... - Sir, he's lying.

797
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:35,368
You will get your chance.

798
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,104
But I never said anything like...
- Mr. Deepak!

799
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,544
Minal, the honorable Judge is saying that
you'll get a chance to defend yourself.

800
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,548
Just sit down and be quiet!

801
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,415
Would you like to cross-examine him?
- No, cross your honor.

802
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,558
Minal Arora, please take the stand.

803
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,332
The charges against
you are quiet serious...

804
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,102
...Do you have anything to say?

805
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,538
Sir...they are all lying.

806
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,486
You can go.

807
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:28,460
Please write that the
accused has pleaded not guilty.

808
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:37,304
Let's see...how are you today?

809
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:40,666
Good.

810
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,576
...So this is done... this is okay.

811
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,645
Doctor, I want to go home.

812
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,388
Deepak...

813
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,124
Deepak!

814
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:03,296
L-low are you'?

815
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,225
Have you been taking your medicines?

816
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,265
What?

817
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,605
Sarah wants to go home.

818
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,204
But...

819
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:26,218
So...Andrea Tariang, are you
from the North-East? - Yes, sir.

820
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,515
Where exactly in North-east?

821
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,182
Manipur
- Meghalaya.

822
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,019
Please tell the court how long
have you been in this profession'?

823
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,495
Objection...nothing of this
sort has been proved in the court.

824
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,533
In order to prove my point, it's
important that I question her, Mr. Sehgal.

825
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,169
L-low long have you been soliciting'?
- This is a lie.

826
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,570
I do nothing of this sort!

827
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,665
I am here...you don't have to...

828
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,210
It's not necessary to answer that.

829
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,439
Sir, I work in an
event management company.

830
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:54,044
I am being wrongly accused.

831
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:57,243
Then why did you go to the
other room with Dumpy that night?

832
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,281
I went to use the toilet.

833
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,651
But you spent quite
some time in the room!!

834
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:04,247
Yes, but... - I don't
want an explanation, ma'am!

835
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,486
I just want an answer,
a clear cut answer!

836
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,622
Yes, I was there for some time.
- You were there.

837
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,521
So, when you went into
the room to use the washroom...

838
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,692
...who shut the door?

839
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,967
I don't remember
- No?

840
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,363
You did!

841
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,143
The CCTV cameras installed
for security purposes...

842
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,571
...clearly show Dumpy entering
the room first...then you...

843
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,138
And you shut the door.

844
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,349
Maybe I did.
- That's all, your honor.

845
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,449
I would like to cross-examine Andrea

846
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:43,555
So Andrea...
you're from the North-East.

847
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,096
Meghalaya.

848
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,199
'Megha.'

849
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:54,103
Clouds! Mountains!
Beauty! Music...and football!

850
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:57,076
L-low is this relevant,
Mr. Deepak'?

851
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,370
I thought it is.

852
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:02,041
Mukesh Kumar wasn't ever
asked whether he's from Rajasthan.

853
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:05,711
Sarla Premchand wasn't asked
if she happens to be from Haryana.

854
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:10,685
No one asked the Doctor or even
Ramakant Vijay... so, I thought that

855
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:15,122
if Mr. Prashant is specifically asking
Andrea, there must be some relevance.

856
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:18,358
Sir, I feel as a North-Eastern girl...

857
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,401
...I am being harassed more than
the average Indian girl on the street.

858
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:32,205
So... Andrea, what was the reason
for going into the other room?

859
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,339
Rajvir said the flush
wasn't working in his room.

860
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,110
So he told me to go
to the other room.

861
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,710
Did you verify this?
- No, but it was Rajvir's room.

862
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,577
And he told me to
go to the other room.

863
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:42,987
What could I have done?

864
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:47,653
Why didn't you go alone?
- Rajvir said that the room was locked.

865
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,586
He told Dumpy to open it for me.

866
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,495
And he just followed
me to the other room.

867
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:55,161
Why did you shut the door and not him?

868
01:09:56,225 --> 01:10:00,696
I didn't think clearly, I was in a rush..
he was switching the lights on.

869
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,637
It was instinctive
- Fair enough.

870
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,441
Then why did you stay behind?
What were you doing?

871
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,009
Answer me...the court wants to know.

872
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,381
First I used the bathroom.

873
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,115
Then, when I came
out of the bathroom...

874
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,049
...he had already
switched off the lights.

875
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:19,558
I called out his name a few times,
I was scared to step out of the loo.

876
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,093
And then I heard him
laughing inside the room.

877
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,694
And then he started touching me.

878
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,793
Then he pushed me onto the
bed...and he started touching my...

879
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,369
He touched my...

880
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,811
That's all, your honor.

881
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,742
Mr. Prashant, it seems quite clear
why Andrea went into the room...

882
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:48,812
...and why she stayed
for so long etc. etc.

883
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,148
But I do get your point.

884
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:56,356
And your point leads me to the
making of 'A girl's safety manual'.

885
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:05,662
A girl should never go
anywhere with a boy alone.

886
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:11,736
Not to a resort... and definitely
not to use the bathroom.

887
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,539
Because by her doing that,
people presume...

888
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:19,017
...that since she has
willingly come there...

889
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:27,427
they have been issued a license
to touch her inappropriately.

890
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,091
Rule no. 1!

891
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:34,167
Let's not moralize unnecessarily <i>,</i>
Mr.Sehgal.

892
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,427
Let's talk about facts.

893
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:40,065
Sir, I would now like to call
upon Raunak Anand aka Dumpy.

894
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,040
Raunak Anand, please come!

895
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:47,106
Dumpy Anand, did you go with
Andrea to the other room that night?

896
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,307
Yes, I did.

897
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:55,151
...And the two of you remained inside
for quite some time - Yes, we did.

898
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,415
What were you two
doing inside for so long?

899
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,423
Sir...

900
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,558
Sir, how can I say
such things publicly?

901
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,619
Take a guess
- He's lying!

902
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,063
Be quiet!

903
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:11,465
Sir, she told me that Minal
will talk to Rajvir about the money.

904
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,473
I was quite scared, sir.

905
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:17,610
Because she started kissing me,
and unbuttoning my shirt.

906
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,306
I tried to stop her, reason with her.

907
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,440
Right Dumpy Anand, but why
should the court believe

908
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,178
...that you resisted?

909
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,620
After all you look like
a fairly healthy young man.

910
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,314
And Andrea is a very pretty girl.

911
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,557
You were inside a
room with a pretty girl...

912
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:35,459
...and yet you did nothing.
In fact, you resisted.

913
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,020
All this is very difficult to believe!

914
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,727
Sir, because I have a girlfriend.
I am committed to her.

915
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:44,304
And I come from a very
decent family, sir - I object.

916
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,636
To what?
- To this awkward performance.

917
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,231
He's over-acting!

918
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,533
Sir, he's uttering nonsense.

919
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,510
He was flirting with
her the whole night!

920
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,475
And the poor girl was trying
to ignore him all the time!

921
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,642
I would like to call upon...
co-accused, Falak Ali.

922
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,515
She seems to have a lot to say.

923
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,754
Are you the only
breadwinner in your family?

924
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:09,518
Yes.

925
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,989
I am sure your brother's
treatment is quite expensive.

926
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,658
I mean after all he's a special child.

927
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:16,999
Yes.

928
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,663
L-low much does your tour job pay'?

929
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,337
RS.40,000!

930
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,638
Rs.40,000!
And what do you get in-hand?

931
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,542
30,000
- 30,000!

932
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,511
Any loans?

933
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,744
A personal loan...
and a home-improvement loan.

934
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,177
Home-improvement loan!

935
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,087
Then I guess you're
always in the need of money.

936
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:39,617
Yes, I am but... - Any other
financial support from anyone?

937
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:40,557
No...

938
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,061
Sir, I am... I am not getting
whatever it is that you're hinting at.

939
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,120
Naturally... I just
wanted to establish

940
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,724
...that you're perpetually
in the need of money...

941
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,267
...and you have no
other source of income.

942
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:54,440
But... - Now let me clarify as to why
I wanted to establish this... For that...

943
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:55,736
...I would like to
call upon Rajvir Singh.

944
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,342
Rajvir Singh, please come.

945
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:03,039
Please describe the series of
events that took place in RS resort!

946
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,279
Well, that night we happened
to be at a rock show and... - Objection!

947
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,449
But he hasn't even begun!

948
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:13,155
We all know Rajvir Singh,
that you did your schooling...

949
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,389
...from a top international school.

950
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,762
After that you had the
opportunity to pursue Engineering...

951
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,127
...but you opted for Economics.

952
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,671
First you studied
at the local University...

953
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:29,141
...and later...you joined
King's College, London.

954
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,541
To study Economics.

955
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:34,412
I can understand that this
will be very difficult for you...

956
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:38,543
...but, can you take your
hands out of your pocket?

957
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,453
Sure.

958
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,753
Sir, they first saw
us at the rock show.

959
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,589
Later they became very friendly
with us and we got along quite well.

960
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:55,398
Did it make you suspicious
considering you hadn't met before'?...

961
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,130
No sir, I didn't get
suspicious at the rock-show.

962
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:00,036
I just thought they
are the friendly type.

963
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:04,010
But I started having doubts at the resort,
once they started dropping hints.

964
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,409
What kind of hints?

965
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,413
Like...'let's split up,
you can give us something...

966
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,538
...and we'll all have a good time'.

967
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,142
Even then they weren't being blatant?
- No, sir.

968
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:15,313
But later when they were a few
drinks down, they came to the point.

969
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:19,086
Which was? - That we
can have more fun if we pay up.

970
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,524
More fun? Please be more specific.

971
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,426
Sir, I was already suspicious
when they took us to separate rooms.

972
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,762
And you panicked
and later... - Objection.

973
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,263
Mr.Prashant,
why call him to the stand at all...

974
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,325
...when you are so Keen
to record your own testimony

975
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,373
Mr.Prashant, please don't
lead the witness. - Sir...

976
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:36,606
At the resort,
Minal made a drink for me.

977
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,612
Then she started touching me.

978
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,544
In fact even I responded,
I went with the flow.

979
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,014
Later she asked me for
money and I was shocked.

980
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:44,717
I panicked... when I realized
that these girls are soliciting

981
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,218
So I asked her to leave.

982
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,585
I said I am not interested
- Right.

983
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,614
But she said doesn't matter...

984
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,284
...you must pay me.

985
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,689
Or else I'll start screaming
that you're trying to rape me.

986
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,197
But you still refused to pay her.
- Yes sir.

987
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,563
Then?
- Then she pushed me.

988
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,069
She attacked me with
the bottle in her hand.

989
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,969
That's all, your honor.
- I need to question him.

990
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:13,043
Rajvir Singh, you just
said that she dropped some hints.

991
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,447
What kind of hints?

992
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:20,653
She was being very frank, smiling at
me, touching me while talking to me.

993
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:27,753
Oh... you've finished?
- Yes.

994
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:34,189
You said she was smiling during the
conversation and touching you at times.

995
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:39,533
So... basically that becomes
the making of Rule no. 2...

996
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,673
...of the 'Girl's Safety Manual'.

997
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:50,478
No girl should 'ever' talk
to a boy ' while smiling'..

998
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,743
...or 'touch him'.

999
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:58,789
Because he'll take that as a hint.

1000
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,989
Her 'smile' will be
considered a 'yes', and...

1001
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:08,126
...what is 'natural human behavior' can
make her seem 'characterless' to him.

1002
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:37,396
That's her - Right? The Surajkund girl!
- Yeah, that's her.

1003
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,715
I am being honest, sir.

1004
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,085
I've seen it with my own eyes, and so
have Residents' Association members.

1005
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,222
Boys do come to their
apartment often.

1006
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,278
That will be all, your honor.

1007
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:09,261
Mr. Gupta, about the boys...

1008
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,725
Could they be their friends?

1009
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,626
Maybe
- maybe not, Mr.Sehgal.

1010
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,168
What do they do inside?

1011
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,225
Didn't you ever try to peep in?

1012
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,171
L-low can I peep into someones home'?

1013
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:23,038
So you never saw them
taking money from those boys...

1014
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,602
...or sleeping with them...
- No, but...

1015
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:30,673
There's no room for a
'but' in a 'no', Mr. Gupta,

1016
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,987
Your honor, Mr. Gupta and Mr. Sinha...

1017
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,386
...from the residents' association
are merely presuming things.

1018
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,719
But they have made
an important point.

1019
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,489
These girls do come back late.

1020
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:44,255
In our society, clearly the
clock determines a person's character.

1021
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,398
When girls walk down
the road alone at night...

1022
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,528
...cars slow down,
windows get rolled down...

1023
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,505
But no one thinks of this
great idea during the day.

1024
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,005
Never!

1025
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,341
Do you have your own house in Delhi?

1026
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:02,480
Yes
- Where?

1027
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,245
In Karol Baug - Right, Karol Baug.
And your parents live there!

1028
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,980
So why did you leave home then...

1029
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:08,248
...and start living on
rent with these girls?

1030
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,516
Sir, I am a working woman.

1031
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,150
My dance shows would
sometimes go on till very late...

1032
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:16,389
...and my parents would often
get disturbed once I was home...

1033
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,055
...that is why -Not to disturb them?

1034
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,262
Or to freely carry on
with your trade? Now...

1035
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:26,703
...thousands of
independent girls work till late...

1036
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,464
...and live peacefully at home.

1037
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,165
What makes you an exception?

1038
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,290
That's Minal.

1039
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,998
Andrea.

1040
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,100
This is Falak.

1041
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,591
Eat
- Thank you.

1042
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,126
The next hearing is on the 29th.

1043
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:56,289
Where did you meet these boys...

1044
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,160
...and under what circumstances?

1045
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,593
We met at a rock show.

1046
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,140
I already knew Vishwa from school.

1047
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,601
He introduced us to Rajvir and Dumpy.

1048
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:15,773
So you knew one of them from school...

1049
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,684
...and that's why you went with them.

1050
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:24,218
Did anyone of them say anything odd...

1051
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,726
...which could've changed your
decision of going with them?

1052
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,329
No! No, sir.

1053
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,096
We thought we were safe with them.

1054
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:37,359
Then?

1055
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,173
Since they kept on insisting...

1056
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,510
...we decided to have
dinner before heading home.

1057
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:51,343
Ms. Minal, were you
smiling and being extrafriendly'?

1058
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,182
I was normal
- What?

1059
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,553
I was normal
- Normal!

1060
01:21:56,611 --> 01:22:00,457
Food, drinks, normal, Smiling.

1061
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:04,095
If they were such
excellent hosts, Ms. Minal...

1062
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,757
...then why do such a thing?

1063
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,230
You hit him on his
head with a bottle. Why?

1064
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,402
Sir, he grabbed me!

1065
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,404
Wouldn't let go!

1066
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:22,347
I don't know what came over me.
Can't really explain.

1067
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:27,048
But sir,
it is a disgusting feeling...

1068
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,644
...when someone touches
you without your will.

1069
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:32,685
And I lost it.

1070
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:41,259
I am really sorry
that he got hurt so badly.

1071
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,398
Unintentionally.

1072
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:50,402
But who wouldn't react
if touched in that manner?

1073
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,235
Forcibly.

1074
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:08,225
Need I say anything more,
your honor?

1075
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,224
Note it down.

1076
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:17,194
"Minal Arora says Rajvir Singh
tried to outrage my modesty..."

1077
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,436
"...and I did so to protect myself."

1078
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,269
Mr. Prashant, cross
- Yes.

1079
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,641
Drama! Drama! Drama!

1080
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,474
The theatrics continue your honor.

1081
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:33,616
You managed some thoughtful editing.

1082
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:37,155
Let me talk about the bits you left out.

1083
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:42,559
L-low much did you demand'?

1084
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:45,223
Objection!
- Mr. Prashant, careful.

1085
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,196
Sir, it's difficult for
me to accept the fact...

1086
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:51,328
...that a girl would go
to a boy's hotel room...

1087
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:54,270
...just because she knows him a bit.

1088
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,535
Which decent girl goes to
a resort with strangers?

1089
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:04,012
Sir, I thought they were decent
guys but I agree it was a mistake.

1090
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:05,982
It wasn't a mistake, ma'am.

1091
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,451
It was a calculated move!
- No!

1092
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,614
Yes.

1093
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:12,246
You just said that you
thought those boys were safe.

1094
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:13,624
What did you mean by that?

1095
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:19,224
I mean, I didn't think they
were aggressive - You didn't.

1096
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:22,463
You didn't think they
will try and hurt you?

1097
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,366
Yes
- Decent boys.

1098
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:29,273
Yes, but.

1099
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:31,402
Then you must have also thought...

1100
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,412
...that these boys are also
a bit flamboyant and rich.

1101
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,646
They might be interested.

1102
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,274
And it will be easy
to brow beat them.

1103
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,545
So you won't really have a
problem in extorting them.

1104
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:41,446
But that didn't happen.

1105
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,554
They weren't interested. And
there was no walk over either.

1106
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,356
That's why this happened.

1107
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,253
You didn't go with them
because they insisted...

1108
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,355
...or because they
invited you to dinner.

1109
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:56,200
By then we had become friends

1110
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:59,204
It takes years to
make friends, Ms. Arora.

1111
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,442
Acquaintances
- Huh?

1112
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,604
We got acquainted
- That's exactly what I am saying...

1113
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:10,343
...that you just got to know
that Rajvir is from a rich.

1114
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:15,354
Sir, at that time I didn't know
that they are rich or well-connected.

1115
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:22,256
Well, let's agree for a moment that you
went there without any ulterior motive.

1116
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,493
Just for dinner.

1117
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,656
Then why did you start drinking?

1118
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:36,733
They offered us a drink and we had one.

1119
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:41,037
Thank God for once you didn't
claim that you were forced.

1120
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,583
Sir...we've submitted a photograph.

1121
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:47,313
For the record, she is
seen making her own drink.

1122
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,085
Luckily, this was
captured on Dumpy's phone.

1123
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,194
Sir, the table was too small
- Yes.

1124
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,720
Rajvir asked me for the bottle.

1125
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:02,996
It was out of his reach,
so I poured a drink for him.

1126
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,695
Point to be noted, your honor.

1127
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:07,233
She made a drink for Rajvir on her own.

1128
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:10,576
This means she had started planning
things even before she went to his room.

1129
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:12,543
Sir, the bottle was
out of his reach, so.

1130
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,376
Are you sure you had just one drink?

1131
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:16,615
One drink
- Huh!

1132
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,540
At the restaurant.

1133
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,676
And one
- One?

1134
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,519
In the room
- Yes.

1135
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,115
Out in the restaurant...

1136
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,159
...you struck an obscene
conversation with Rajvir...

1137
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:29,228
...to which the manager is a witness.

1138
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:32,996
What was that about?
- I don't remember.

1139
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,065
You don't?

1140
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:35,691
Then let me remind you.

1141
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,034
You were describing a sexual act.

1142
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,472
Were you describing
different sexual acts...

1143
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,374
...and how much you charge for each'?

1144
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:55,514
How I remember, he cracked a joke,
and so I told him one and...

1145
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,023
Joke, what joke?

1146
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,717
Mr. Prashant, what is this?

1147
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,057
Sir, let us hear the joke.

1148
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:05,097
She's just bluffing so
I want to call her bluff.

1149
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,096
I am not lying.

1150
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:07,394
Then tell us the joke;
what is the problem?

1151
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:12,098
If the description is close
to what the manager described

1152
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,161
...we will believe you.

1153
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,348
I can't
- Why?

1154
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,690
Oh you can't cook one up?

1155
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,590
It was slightly risqué and cracked in
private. It is difficult to do this publicly.

1156
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:36,025
That's exactly my point,
your honor.

1157
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,655
When a girl can't even
tell a risque joke in public...

1158
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,598
...how will she admit that
she went there to solicit?

1159
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:49,733
Naturally she will say that she
was there for drinks and dinner.

1160
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,537
But the court should realize that...

1161
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,341
...she went there with guys...

1162
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,779
...who were almost strangers to her.

1163
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:59,008
As for her guilt we can't
depend on her statement.

1164
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,610
We'll have to rely on
other evidence and testimonies.

1165
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:06,281
For example this video evidence...

1166
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:10,628
...will prove the charges.

1167
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:21,233
In the first clip from
camera no.1, Falak comes out...

1168
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:24,406
...and then all the
three girls come together.

1169
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:27,440
They have a conversation.

1170
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,637
Arrive at a decision and a price.

1171
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:32,017
Minal goes back in with the two.

1172
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:44,262
Now in the second clip from camera
no.2, Andrea comes outwith Dumpy...

1173
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:49,525
...and they head towards room no. 503,
which was Dumpy's room.

1174
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:54,200
Dumpy opens the room,
switches on the lights...

1175
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,474
...and Andrea shuts the door.

1176
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:00,536
And a little later the
lights are switched off.

1177
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,484
Then Falak comes outwith Vishwa
so they are splitting into couples.

1178
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,245
After some time there's
yelling and screaming.

1179
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:10,380
Everyone runs towards Rajvir's room.

1180
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:13,584
This is because Minal
demanded money from Rajvir inside.

1181
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:16,356
He refused to pay.
They had an argument...

1182
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:20,258
...and when the girls realized
their mistake, they fled.

1183
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:22,995
They wouldn't have run
off if they were innocent.

1184
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:25,728
They would've called the police...

1185
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:28,269
But such girls will
never call the police.

1186
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:30,403
And we've heard the waiter
and the manager's testimony.

1187
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:37,383
In fact, even their neighbors
think that they are up to no good.

1188
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:41,448
This is bloody bulls****
- Minal Arora, language!

1189
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,682
You and your clients are lying.

1190
01:29:44,178 --> 01:29:47,716
We went to have dinner
because they kept on insisting.

1191
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:50,087
We didn't go there to demand money.

1192
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:53,064
The room was full of cigarette
smoke and it had been a while...

1193
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:54,498
...since Andrea had left, so Falak
stepped outwith Vishwa to check.

1194
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:57,764
But the moment I got up to go,
he started touching me.

1195
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,702
I warned him.

1196
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,764
But he held me forcibly.

1197
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,768
That's when I hit him
with the bottle, sir.

1198
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:10,582
And if he ever does it again,
I'll do the same thing!

1199
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:13,518
Minal Arora, next time
- But, sir.

1200
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,316
I will have you removed.

1201
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:17,681
Minal, quiet.

1202
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,760
The court is adjourned
- Sir, I didn't ask for money.

1203
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,326
I didn't take any.

1204
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:26,456
Please, listen to me.

1205
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,629
Please, we didn't ask for any money.

1206
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:46,141
I am feeling unwell, Falak.

1207
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,701
Falak, let Minal come home tonight.

1208
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:25,350
Minal, I'm packing this too.

1209
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:24,040
Your honor, I would like
to call S.H.O. Surajkund...

1210
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:25,710
...Sarla Premchand.

1211
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,446
Sarla Premchand!

1212
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,116
Superwoman
- What?

1213
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,661
Mr. Deepak
- Your honor, Superwoman!

1214
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:39,563
Superman-Superwoman.

1215
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:44,364
Ms. Sarla, I want to know why...

1216
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:48,271
...did you not arrest
Minal Arora immediately...

1217
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,707
...after the complaint
against her was filed?

1218
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,473
Sir, she was absconding.

1219
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,078
Hiding somewhere I guess.

1220
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:59,380
Then how did you find her so easily
at home when you finally arrested her'?

1221
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,383
Well I
- Maybe she got tired hiding.

1222
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:05,424
"No one's looking for me,
this is not fun anymore".

1223
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,116
So she took a cab and came home...

1224
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:12,096
...and you finally found her with ease.

1225
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:14,756
We
- Louder! I can't hear you.

1226
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,433
We received a tip
- What?

1227
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:19,699
Someone gave us a tip
- Tip? You mean tipoff.

1228
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,065
Who informed on her?

1229
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:29,338
We had deployed our men in
the streets around her house.

1230
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:32,244
Your honor, she's lying
- No, our men were posted there.

1231
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,411
You're lying, Ms. Sarla
- No, why would I lie?

1232
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,148
You are lying
- No, sir, they were there.

1233
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:37,314
No, you're lying
- No, why would I?

1234
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:38,482
You're lying.

1235
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:41,419
Maybe you didn't see them.

1236
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,290
Your honor! Your honor!
Your honor!

1237
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:48,293
Instead of intimidating
the investigating officer...

1238
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:51,565
...it would be much better if the
learned council proved her wrong.

1239
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:56,072
That seems fair
- Yeah.

1240
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:00,638
Ms. Sarla, I would
like to prove my point.

1241
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:08,176
This is a copy of the
report you wrote down.

1242
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:12,456
An entry was made here
about the incident reported.

1243
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:15,756
Isn't this the one?
- Yes, I wrote this out.

1244
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,324
But Ms. Sarla, you
weren't on duty that night.

1245
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,625
We have evidence proving that
you were present at a wedding.

1246
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,170
Is this you?
- Yes.

1247
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:28,736
Nice sari, Ms. Sarla.

1248
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:34,503
So you were off-duty...

1249
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:37,539
...yet you wrote down the report...

1250
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,782
...with a different pen,
using different ink.

1251
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,085
How?

1252
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,286
I was back from the wedding by then.

1253
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:51,228
You made it back from a banquet
hall in Faridabad Sector 77...

1254
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:56,658
...to the Surajkund Police
Station in 10 minutes.

1255
01:34:56,724 --> 01:35:02,174
You left at 11 :05 pm and reached
Surajkund Police Station at 11 :15 pm.

1256
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,041
A distance of 22 kilometers...

1257
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,512
...which normally takes
42 minutes to cover.

1258
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:12,381
You did it in 10 minutes?

1259
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:14,742
Let me guess.

1260
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:18,582
You started your car
at 132 km per hour and...

1261
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:26,292
...drove at the same speed to
reach Surajkund Police Station.

1262
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:29,728
You should've been on the speed track.

1263
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:33,367
You are wasting your talent
with the police department.

1264
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:35,566
Sir, it was a crime of serious nature...

1265
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:38,303
...so I drove down
at a break neck speed.

1266
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,278
Okay so it was a crime
of serious nature and...

1267
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:44,577
...you drove at a break neck
speed but filed your report...

1268
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:46,050
...in just two sentences.

1269
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,711
"Minal Arora struck Rajvir on his
head with a bottle at RS Resort...

1270
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:52,781
...with the intention of
killing him. He bled a lot."

1271
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:56,456
Well, things seem quite clear.

1272
01:35:56,517 --> 01:36:00,021
What else did you want me to write?
- No, things aren't that clear.

1273
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:05,001
You decided to write
down Minal's full name...

1274
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:08,097
...but you didn't even bother
to write Rajvir's surname.

1275
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,542
But we are decent
folk so we accepted...

1276
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:17,046
...that the Rajvir you're referring
to is this Rajvir Singh here.

1277
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,652
Well I think I wrote
what was necessary.

1278
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,485
"When Sushil Vats got
into the rickshaw, he..."

1279
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:29,024
This is another report filed by you.

1280
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:33,054
"When Sushil Vats got into the
rickshaw, he still had his phone."

1281
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,199
"When he got down and
checked his pockets..."

1282
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:37,099
"...the mobile phone was missing."

1283
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:42,574
"He tried to recollect as to
when he had seen his Zing 3C last."

1284
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,008
Then you have struck
out'3C' and changed it to '36'.

1285
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:47,579
What detail and
dedication, Ms. Sarla.

1286
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:51,081
"Zing 3G mobile."

1287
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,711
You've written a few
more lines after that.

1288
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:57,082
A half a page report...

1289
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:01,985
...for a mobile left behind in a taxi.

1290
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:06,396
And barely two sentences for a
crime of such serious nature.

1291
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,691
I will tell you why.

1292
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:15,337
Because there was little space left...

1293
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,270
...on the page...

1294
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,376
...for you to make a backdated entry.

1295
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:25,410
Your honor, in this police diary...

1296
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:29,648
...all other reports are a
half or full page long...

1297
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:34,455
...but this is the only cryptic entry.

1298
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:39,464
Reason - the page on which
she wrote out her report...

1299
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,231
...was already full...

1300
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:47,998
...because she didn't write this on the
night of the incident but much later.

1301
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,270
There can be no
other reason, your honor.

1302
01:37:54,168 --> 01:38:00,244
This proves that reporting the
incident was an after-thought...

1303
01:38:00,574 --> 01:38:03,077
...and was done only after
Minal Arora decided to...

1304
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:06,353
...file a complaint
against Rajvir Singh...

1305
01:38:07,114 --> 01:38:08,252
...and others.

1306
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:25,228
Are you a virgin?
- Is this relevant?

1307
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,293
It is, your honor.

1308
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,737
Are you willing to answer this question?

1309
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:32,637
In that case we can do
this session in camera.

1310
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,305
You will be more comfortable.

1311
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:43,546
No, sir. I haven't done anything wrong.

1312
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:46,152
I am prepared to answer in open court.

1313
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:47,615
Proceed.

1314
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:50,025
Are you a virgin, Ms. Arora?

1315
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,560
Please answer in a clear 'yes' or 'no'.

1316
01:39:53,587 --> 01:39:56,659
No shaking of the head please
- No.

1317
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:57,592
No!

1318
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:01,070
At what age did you lose your virginity?

1319
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:03,232
L-low is this even relevant, Mr. Deepak'?

1320
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:06,176
The victim's character has been
repeatedly brought into question.

1321
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,042
I am just making everyone's job easier...

1322
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:12,312
...unless the prosecution
has an objection - No.

1323
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,715
At what age did you lose your virginity?

1324
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:19,420
I was 19
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.

1325
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:24,221
At 19
-19!

1326
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:28,362
You lost your
virginity at 19, Ms. Arora.

1327
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:31,593
At 19 your honor,
she was an adult.

1328
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:34,597
Who was the boy?

1329
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,075
My. . . my boyfriend.

1330
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:43,604
Does he have a name?
- Aneesh.

1331
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,580
Aneesh!

1332
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:46,046
Did he pay for it?

1333
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,547
What kind of question
- Just answer my question.

1334
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:51,612
Did he pay for it?

1335
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:55,627
Why would he pay?
- Just answer my question.

1336
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:59,461
What do you want to establish
- I asked you a question.

1337
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,660
You promised that you would answer
- No.

1338
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,668
We liked each other.

1339
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:08,730
We were attracted to each other.

1340
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,109
So there's no question
of him paying for it.

1341
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:16,044
So he didn't pay you?
He did not pay you!

1342
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:18,744
Did he force you?

1343
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:26,622
No. he didn't force me.
He didn't pay me.

1344
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:31,623
We liked each other. We
did it because we wanted to.

1345
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:33,793
Right.

1346
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:37,797
After that,
your close acquaintances...

1347
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:40,505
...which also includes Vishwa,
testified before the police that...

1348
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:44,635
...you have had other relationships.

1349
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:49,113
Did you have 'sexual
relations' with all of them?

1350
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:55,083
Some of them
- So you did.

1351
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:58,087
You did. You just admitted that.

1352
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:00,721
So I just wanted to ask...

1353
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:05,253
...what ticked you off that night?

1354
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:07,693
I mean how would it matter if
you slept with one more guy'?

1355
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,231
What? What do you mean?

1356
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:15,569
That on the night of March the first...

1357
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:18,373
...this is exactly what
Rajvir Singh and his friends...

1358
01:42:18,398 --> 01:42:19,706
...would have
naturally presumed about you.

1359
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:25,478
That you are fairly promiscuous
and it wouldn't really matter to you...

1360
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:27,018
...if you went to bed with one more guy.

1361
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:30,382
I understand that they are not
mature enough to understand...

1362
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:35,717
...that whenever it happened before
- happened with your consent.

1363
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:39,459
Without any money being involved,
without any coercion.

1364
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,798
But the prosecution has proved that...

1365
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:46,634
...you're a woman of
questionable character.

1366
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:51,038
And since you were a woman
of questionable character...

1367
01:42:51,098 --> 01:42:55,308
...in the eyes of the accused
Rajvir Singh and his friends...

1368
01:42:55,469 --> 01:43:00,248
...on that day, at that moment,
what did you do...

1369
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,416
...to make it clear...

1370
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:08,153
...that right now I am
not interested in sex?

1371
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,720
What did you say?

1372
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:18,026
I refused - What did you say?
What exactly did you do?

1373
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:24,131
I pushed him. I said
leave me, don't do this.

1374
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:25,536
You refused.

1375
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:29,080
In what words? What did you say?

1376
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:34,351
What did you say, Ms. Minal Arora?
What did you tell him?

1377
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:36,419
I said no.

1378
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:39,385
No, don't.

1379
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:42,160
I said no.

1380
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:48,565
Will you say that loud enough for
the court to hear, Ms. Minal Arora'?

1381
01:43:50,457 --> 01:43:52,198
I said no.

1382
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:54,764
I said no.

1383
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:02,011
You said 'no'!

1384
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:16,292
She said 'no', your honor.

1385
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:22,093
But even after that Rajvir Singh
touched her in a very disgusting manner.

1386
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:24,396
She felt humiliated.

1387
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:29,037
She was a bit drunk; and
which brings me to rule no. 4.

1388
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:34,004
No 'girl' should ever
have a drink with a 'boy'.

1389
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,581
Because if she does, the
boy seems to think that...

1390
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:42,450
...if she can have a drink with me,
then she won't mind sleeping with me.

1391
01:44:45,012 --> 01:44:50,690
For girls, drinking
alcohol means being available.

1392
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:53,430
Just for 'girls'.

1393
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,794
Not for 'boys'. This
doesn't apply to boys.

1394
01:44:57,090 --> 01:45:00,367
For the boys it's just
a health hazard.

1395
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:04,009
So terms and
conditions differ, your honor.

1396
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:07,669
Wearing jeans, t-shirts...

1397
01:45:09,303 --> 01:45:11,044
skirts etcetera.

1398
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,608
Girls shouldn't be doing that.

1399
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:16,249
It doesn't harm them in anyway...

1400
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:19,757
...but poses a deep
threat to the boys.

1401
01:45:22,082 --> 01:45:25,029
Poor boys get provoked on
seeing them like this and...

1402
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:29,066
...for no fault of theirs, the
poor boys end up making mistakes.

1403
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:30,994
Until now...

1404
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:35,235
...we've been making
efforts in the wrong direction.

1405
01:45:35,595 --> 01:45:38,132
We should save our boys, not our girls.

1406
01:45:39,032 --> 01:45:42,377
Because if we save our boys,
then our girls will be safe.

1407
01:45:45,105 --> 01:45:47,415
Girls in the city
shouldn't live separately.

1408
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,077
They should not live alone.

1409
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:51,386
Boys can. Not girls.

1410
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:55,319
Independent girls confuse boys.

1411
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:57,725
Girls should never smile
during a conversation.

1412
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:00,094
In fact, even if they
are giving good news...

1413
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,259
...they should do so with a grave face.

1414
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:10,200
No mobiles for girls, don't educate
them. Get them married early.

1415
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:13,608
Etc! Etc! Etc!

1416
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:18,114
But...

1417
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:20,713
...I am digressing, your honor.

1418
01:46:21,508 --> 01:46:23,454
My client had had a few drinks.

1419
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:31,259
And that could've perhaps been
the cause of her intense action.

1420
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:34,055
That is all that happened.

1421
01:46:34,421 --> 01:46:38,597
Repeatedly touching a
girl inappropriately!

1422
01:46:43,263 --> 01:46:44,401
What can a girl...

1423
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:48,045
...do in such a situation?

1424
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:50,673
<i>What do you expect her to do?</i>

1425
01:46:51,104 --> 01:46:55,177
This is called acting in self-defense.

1426
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:56,644
Not...

1427
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:04,057
...causing grievous injury or
attempt to murder, your honor.

1428
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:08,258
Not that at all.

1429
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:18,038
No, no, no, your honor.

1430
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:19,672
I agree she was drunk.

1431
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:23,314
But according to her,
her friend was sober.

1432
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,109
Why didn't Falak Ali break
a bottle on Vishwa's head?

1433
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:30,086
Why did she come out
along with Andrea and Vishwa?

1434
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:33,317
And we just saw it
clearly in the video footage.

1435
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:39,260
I would like to call
Falak Ali on the stand again.

1436
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:50,139
Do you know a professor Javed?

1437
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:52,573
Yes.

1438
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,271
How?
- He's a friend.

1439
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:56,143
Friend.

1440
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:58,110
Friend or more than a friend?

1441
01:47:59,172 --> 01:48:00,583
That's personal
- Huh!

1442
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,483
It is a personal matter
- I see.

1443
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:03,577
It's a personal matter.

1444
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:08,149
So your 'friend', he is
older than you, divorced...

1445
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:11,025
...and he also has a child
- I am sorry, but...

1446
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:12,557
...that's his personal life.

1447
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:16,193
Your honor, I can
prove that he's no friend.

1448
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:19,027
This is a purely business relationship.

1449
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,028
He is just another client.

1450
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:24,172
No!

1451
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:26,707
How can you say such things'?

1452
01:48:27,567 --> 01:48:29,046
These are your bank statements...

1453
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:31,208
...which I would like to
present before the court.

1454
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:34,611
This proves the exact
nature of their relationship.

1455
01:48:34,674 --> 01:48:37,177
L-low can you say such
a thing about a girl'?

1456
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:41,522
Over the years, almost every month...

1457
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:44,519
...25,000 rupees have been
transferred from his account to yours.

1458
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:46,055
Can you explain this?

1459
01:48:46,653 --> 01:48:50,100
These are loans which I took to
pay for my brother's treatment.

1460
01:48:50,156 --> 01:48:50,657
Oh!

1461
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,536
And I've started repaying him.

1462
01:48:54,427 --> 01:48:56,338
Why don't you tell everyone about that?

1463
01:48:56,396 --> 01:48:57,568
I was getting to that, your honor.

1464
01:48:57,764 --> 01:49:00,108
She has now gradually
started to pay him back.

1465
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:02,703
Bit by bit, now!

1466
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,607
After this case was filed.

1467
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:08,347
Because she knew that this
will be brought up in court.

1468
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:12,352
She is a professional
and has a sharp mind.

1469
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:15,950
Why do you twist every
fact and then present it?

1470
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:18,462
We broke up. We're
not together anymore.

1471
01:49:18,485 --> 01:49:19,987
So I am not comfortable...

1472
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:21,555
...and that's why I am
returning the money.

1473
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:24,569
You're pretending to
return it when it is needed...

1474
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:26,626
...and you're always in need of money.

1475
01:49:27,093 --> 01:49:29,004
This is how you supplement your income.

1476
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:31,474
Is that why you stepped out of
the room after Andrea that night?

1477
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:34,444
Objection! - Sir the girls were
leaving the room one by one with a boy.

1478
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:36,708
Objection, your honor - We've
submitted her brother's medical bills.

1479
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,677
Objection, your honor...
- Council.

1480
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:41,311
It's not possible
- Objection, your honor.

1481
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:44,048
Mr. Deepak, please keep
the dignity of the court.

1482
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:45,714
My friends help me out too.

1483
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:46,980
Your friends help you out. Friends.

1484
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,319
Yes.

1485
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,757
They help you in running your house.

1486
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:51,122
Why don't you
introduce me to such friends?

1487
01:49:51,217 --> 01:49:52,218
A lot of us have friends...

1488
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,322
...but none of them help
us in running our house.

1489
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:55,695
Your honor, I... I... l object.

1490
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:59,461
Please accept that this
is a source of income.

1491
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:00,664
This is how you make a living...

1492
01:50:00,694 --> 01:50:02,173
...otherwise you would've
never gone outwith him.

1493
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:03,571
Yes I should've never gone
out of the room with him!

1494
01:50:15,775 --> 01:50:20,747
I regret that to this date.

1495
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:23,027
Maybe if I hadn't gone out of the room,
none of this would've ever happened.

1496
01:50:23,083 --> 01:50:25,222
Or even if it did, it
would've happened to both of us.

1497
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,526
Answer the question. I
know all about your mistakes.

1498
01:50:27,587 --> 01:50:29,032
You took money
- Objection, your honor.

1499
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:30,159
You want to humiliate me...

1500
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,328
...like Minal.

1501
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:32,563
Answer my question!

1502
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,799
Did you take money?
Did you demand money?

1503
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:37,473
You want to humiliate me publicly...

1504
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,510
...just to prove that we took money.

1505
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:41,170
You did! You did take money!

1506
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:42,179
Of course you did.

1507
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:44,214
None of this would've
happened if you hadn't.

1508
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:46,216
You could've all
gone your separate ways.

1509
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,752
You're trying to defame
innocent and decent boys.

1510
01:50:48,775 --> 01:50:52,382
Fine. Fine!

1511
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:53,288
Fine!

1512
01:50:56,349 --> 01:50:59,796
We did take money - Your honor, I
wish to talk to my client, please.

1513
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:01,196
No, sir. Please.

1514
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:05,032
I want to say this
and I have to say this.

1515
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:09,438
Yes, we took the money, sir.

1516
01:51:11,264 --> 01:51:14,211
We demanded money and we took it!

1517
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:18,410
But even then, what
happened with Minal

1518
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:21,510
Falak, why are you doing this?
We did not take any money!

1519
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:23,245
Why are you branding us like this?

1520
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:25,448
Andrea Tariang, please keep quiet.

1521
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:28,083
Sir, we took money.

1522
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:31,422
No, sir
- Please sit down.

1523
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:33,088
Please sit
- Let me speak.

1524
01:51:33,286 --> 01:51:37,098
We took money, but even
after taking the money...

1525
01:51:37,123 --> 01:51:39,296
...Minal changed her mind.

1526
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:41,134
She withdrew her consent.

1527
01:51:41,194 --> 01:51:44,107
She said no. She kept saying no.

1528
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:49,769
Even then this man Rajvir kept
on touching her inappropriately.

1529
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:55,315
Now you tell me sir, by law...

1530
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,615
...by law, sir...

1531
01:51:58,578 --> 01:52:00,148
...was she right in doing so or not'?

1532
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:08,256
Falak Ali, please step down.

1533
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:37,024
This session of
the court is adjourned.

1534
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:53,297
I am so sorry!

1535
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,099
I am...
- So sorry.

1536
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:49,624
Sarah was saying it was brave...

1537
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:52,323
It was brave of you.

1538
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,097
She was saying...

1539
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:57,666
The girls didn't take money...

1540
01:54:57,690 --> 01:54:59,033
...and yet admitted to it.

1541
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:04,565
Simply put an end to the argument.

1542
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:07,235
There was nothing else left to do.

1543
01:55:09,736 --> 01:55:11,340
It was starting to hurt my ears.

1544
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:15,348
"They took money... They took money..."

1545
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:20,079
No one was ready to believe
that we didn't take any.

1546
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:26,095
My accepting the thing...

1547
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:30,695
Just ended the ordeal.

1548
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:41,737
Falak.

1549
01:55:49,509 --> 01:55:50,453
How...

1550
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:58,589
Look, l...

1551
01:55:59,252 --> 01:56:01,562
I don't want to involve
Alia in all this.

1552
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:06,700
Please don't answer if she calls.

1553
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:23,576
Javed...

1554
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:27,686
She really loved you.

1555
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:34,564
You know what...you're a coward.

1556
01:56:45,365 --> 01:56:49,404
Rajvir Singh, do you believe that...

1557
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:53,040
...if a girl has a frank
conversation with someone...

1558
01:56:53,072 --> 01:56:56,212
...or touches him while talking to him,
she's basically saying...

1559
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:58,520
"Come sleep with me"?

1560
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:01,419
No...l never said that.

1561
01:57:01,647 --> 01:57:03,183
Your statement is right here.

1562
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:06,154
I said it in context of this case.

1563
01:57:06,386 --> 01:57:07,490
In other cases it depends.

1564
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:10,066
On what?

1565
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:13,494
Like for example where and how
one met...

1566
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:17,641
Meaning if you met
at a rock show then yes...

1567
01:57:18,297 --> 01:57:20,243
...and if you meet at a library
or a religious place then no.

1568
01:57:20,466 --> 01:57:23,003
The venue determines the
character of the person for you.

1569
01:57:23,403 --> 01:57:25,280
You're twisting my words
- No...

1570
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:28,707
...I am only trying to understand you.

1571
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:29,709
Anyway...

1572
01:57:31,077 --> 01:57:35,685
Mr. Prashant said Minal was drunk,
were you drunk too'?

1573
01:57:36,082 --> 01:57:37,561
Yes, I was drinking.

1574
01:57:38,684 --> 01:57:42,564
So, let us assume
that you were drunk.

1575
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:44,998
She stopped or tried to stop you...

1576
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:47,095
...you forced her
so she hit you back.

1577
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,738
That's a possibility?
- Yes

1578
01:57:50,596 --> 01:57:52,269
But that's not what
happened that night.

1579
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:56,573
Ohh...sorry.

1580
01:57:56,602 --> 01:57:58,047
I completely forgot.

1581
01:57:58,137 --> 01:58:00,276
You're getting married.

1582
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:04,613
To MLA Janki Ram's daughter.

1583
01:58:04,677 --> 01:58:07,214
What does my personal
life have to do with this case?

1584
01:58:07,313 --> 01:58:11,193
Nothing but neither did
the personal lives of my clients.

1585
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,988
So you mean I am
characterless just like them!!!

1586
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:17,029
Is that what you want to prove?
- No.

1587
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:19,228
I don't need to prove that.

1588
01:58:20,493 --> 01:58:22,166
But why are you getting irritated?

1589
01:58:22,261 --> 01:58:23,638
I was only congratulating
you on your wedding...

1590
01:58:23,696 --> 01:58:25,107
...but you're getting agitated.

1591
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:27,576
I am not angry...

1592
01:58:28,601 --> 01:58:31,138
...I am just wondering what
my marriage has to do with this?

1593
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:34,510
Rajvir, do you often get this angry?

1594
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:38,986
...Especially when you hear
something you don't want to?

1595
01:58:39,445 --> 01:58:42,119
Dude why are you talking
about my anger again and again?

1596
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:44,718
Dude?

1597
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:48,454
Is it too much to expect
propriety from you'?

1598
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:51,533
I am addressing you
with such respect but you...

1599
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:55,470
Anyway, that's something
I should have expected from you.

1600
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:56,303
Let it be...

1601
01:58:58,564 --> 01:59:04,446
Mr. Rajvir,
do you regularly visit sex-workers?

1602
01:59:06,005 --> 01:59:06,574
No.

1603
01:59:06,606 --> 01:59:09,314
So this was for the very first time.

1604
01:59:09,342 --> 01:59:10,412
If we assume that my clients...

1605
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:13,286
Yes it was!

1606
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:14,287
Okay?

1607
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:19,259
Do you randomly invite
girls over for dinner?

1608
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:20,524
Why did you invite them?

1609
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:22,395
They said we're hungry...

1610
01:59:23,723 --> 01:59:25,066
...so we invited them.

1611
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:26,695
Maybe it was stupid
to be show some humanity!

1612
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,438
We didn't know then
who they really were.

1613
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:32,169
Did you offer them drinks
on humanitarian grounds too?

1614
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:34,575
She made the drink herself.
You saw the photograph, didn't you?

1615
01:59:35,468 --> 01:59:37,141
I didn't see Andrea's
...pouring herself a drink?

1616
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:38,414
Why did you make a drink for her?

1617
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:42,544
We all were drinking, sol
offered her one out of courtesy.

1618
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:48,616
Rajvir, why don't you admit it?

1619
01:59:48,648 --> 01:59:50,594
Is it because you're
soon going to be...

1620
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:53,597
...a part of such a reputable
family through matrimony?

1621
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:56,657
Are you afraid that the
wedding might get called-off?

1622
01:59:57,089 --> 02:00:03,233
This large heartedness - often inviting
random girls for drinks and dinner...

1623
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:05,104
...why aren't you admitting to it?

1624
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,038
Should I tell you the real reason?

1625
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:13,541
You don't want a long
sentence for sexual assault.

1626
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:17,544
So you've cooked up the entire story

1627
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:18,680
Objection, your honor.

1628
02:00:18,744 --> 02:00:20,690
Objection
- What is it, Mr. Prashant?

1629
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:23,454
His clients have admitted
to solici... - Alright, sit down.

1630
02:00:23,616 --> 02:00:24,651
Carry on, Mr. Deepak.

1631
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:26,354
Okay, let me ask
you another question?

1632
02:00:26,485 --> 02:00:30,695
Once you saw that Minal
is making a drink for herself...

1633
02:00:31,591 --> 02:00:34,538
...Didn't you feel that she might be one
of 'those' girls and you should leave!

1634
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:39,435
I didn't think so.

1635
02:00:40,132 --> 02:00:44,046
Do women in your family drink alcohol?

1636
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:49,348
Only the men drink.

1637
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:52,681
Your mother? Your sister?
Do they drink?

1638
02:00:55,281 --> 02:00:57,352
Women from good family don't!

1639
02:00:57,450 --> 02:01:00,454
Do they go to parties?
- They go to family gatherings.

1640
02:01:00,686 --> 02:01:02,097
Okay...
- Not parties.

1641
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:07,427
Therefore...girls who go to parties
and especially those who drink...

1642
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:13,640
...are easy meat

1643
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:18,774
And that's what you presumed
about my client Minal Arora.

1644
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:23,076
The women from your family
don't drink, which makes them decent.

1645
02:01:23,442 --> 02:01:26,013
And since Minal and her
friends drink, they are easy...

1646
02:01:26,045 --> 02:01:28,355
...and one can take
liberties with them.

1647
02:01:28,381 --> 02:01:29,587
But Rajvir...

1648
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:32,288
...To nullify your argument
I would like to show you a photograph.

1649
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,063
This...

1650
02:01:35,588 --> 02:01:39,058
...is a picture of your
sister... with a drink at a party.

1651
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,804
You are crossing the line here.

1652
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,543
You don't know who you're talking to!

1653
02:01:53,539 --> 02:01:55,075
What line of questioning is this,
your honor?

1654
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,678
Why is my client being
unnecessarily provoked?

1655
02:01:57,743 --> 02:01:58,721
Put it down!

1656
02:02:00,546 --> 02:02:03,220
My sister does no such thing!

1657
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:06,257
Drinking, going out
with some random strangers...

1658
02:02:06,552 --> 02:02:07,394
Only girls like these do such things...

1659
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,058
Not someone from a decent family.

1660
02:02:09,355 --> 02:02:11,392
And this is what happens
to such girls - Please be quiet.

1661
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:12,366
Please be quiet, Rajvir.

1662
02:02:12,458 --> 02:02:14,131
It doesn't happen in an
ideal world...and it shouldn't.

1663
02:02:14,226 --> 02:02:16,035
It happens only because
guys like you think...

1664
02:02:16,095 --> 02:02:18,006
...it's their
birth right to misbehave.

1665
02:02:18,064 --> 02:02:20,340
With a just because she wears
a certain dress or drinks alcohol...

1666
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:21,140
...Oh really?
- Objection...

1667
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,305
One sec.

1668
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:25,012
If someone who you
don't know at all..

1669
02:02:25,037 --> 02:02:26,607
...agrees to go out
with you for a drink...

1670
02:02:27,173 --> 02:02:29,050
Any sane man will
think she is willing.

1671
02:02:29,208 --> 02:02:30,050
Why else would she go outwith you?

1672
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:30,745
Why else will she go to your room?
- Objection, sir...

1673
02:02:30,776 --> 02:02:31,413
Mr. Prashant.

1674
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:33,353
It's quite possible
that if she realizes.

1675
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:37,185
...that you're going to rape her, then..
- Sir, one second..

1676
02:02:37,216 --> 02:02:40,493
Rape? - I said stop!
- What do you mean by rape?

1677
02:02:40,753 --> 02:02:42,357
Ask anyone out here
in front of the judge.

1678
02:02:42,388 --> 02:02:45,130
In such circumstances anyone
will try their luck with them!

1679
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:47,635
Do you know what such
girls are called around here?

1680
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:49,232
 Rajvir.

1681
02:02:49,261 --> 02:02:51,673
Mr. Prashant,
please control your client!

1682
02:02:51,764 --> 02:02:52,742
Please!

1683
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:04,744
Thank you.

1684
02:03:07,413 --> 02:03:08,448
Thank you, Rajvir.

1685
02:03:21,427 --> 02:03:24,135
This is exactly what happened,
your honor.

1686
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:30,043
Even the so defined "modern Day"
girls are just girls at heart.

1687
02:03:31,303 --> 02:03:34,147
When they go for dinner
and drinks with a boy...

1688
02:03:34,373 --> 02:03:36,375
...they are going for an evening out

1689
02:03:37,543 --> 02:03:40,683
They don't know it goes with
a 'tag' of being 'available'.

1690
02:03:42,181 --> 02:03:45,219
But even well-dressed,
well-educated boys like him...

1691
02:03:45,484 --> 02:03:49,057
...use the codes of
morality of a bygone era...

1692
02:03:49,321 --> 02:03:52,791
...Dress, drinks...
this decides availability... sick!

1693
02:03:53,192 --> 02:03:55,502
...And those who violate
these codes can be violated.

1694
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:03,205
I rest my case, your honor.

1695
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:48,681
Council, closing arguments please...
Mr. Prashant.

1696
02:04:49,114 --> 02:04:50,684
I've already proved

1697
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:54,663
...that these girls went to RS
Resort with the intent of extorting

1698
02:04:55,354 --> 02:04:58,335
And they took off post assault

1699
02:04:58,357 --> 02:05:00,428
If it wasn't their fault, then...

1700
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:03,133
...they wouldn't have
kept quiet for so long

1701
02:05:03,195 --> 02:05:05,106
They would've approached
the police immediately...

1702
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:06,507
...which my client did.

1703
02:05:07,366 --> 02:05:10,142
Because Rajvir Singh
is from a reputed family,.

1704
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:13,245
He is young,
a bright future awaits him.

1705
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:17,212
Also the testimonies of the doctor...

1706
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:20,257
...the waiter, the manager
and the investigating officer...

1707
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:22,088
...support this contention

1708
02:05:23,015 --> 02:05:25,359
The aspect of consent

1709
02:05:26,051 --> 02:05:29,123
has been forcibly
introduced by the defense...

1710
02:05:29,321 --> 02:05:32,268
...because it is
fashionable these days...

1711
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:34,637
And that's why they have
plugged it out of convenience

1712
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:39,369
So I request you to acquit
Rajvir Singh and others

1713
02:05:40,065 --> 02:05:43,444
...and demand 10 years of
imprisonment for Minal Arora...

1714
02:05:43,469 --> 02:05:46,575
...for 'Attempt to Murder'.

1715
02:05:48,173 --> 02:05:53,054
And Falak and Andrea shouldn't
be left off with an easy fine...

1716
02:05:53,245 --> 02:05:56,124
...they should be
imprisoned for 6 months

1717
02:05:56,215 --> 02:05:58,252
...so that they give up soliciting

1718
02:06:00,152 --> 02:06:01,460
Thank you, sir. I rest my case.

1719
02:06:03,355 --> 02:06:04,459
Mr. Deepak, closing argument.

1720
02:06:08,093 --> 02:06:09,128
Mr. Sehgal.

1721
02:06:20,973 --> 02:06:21,576
No.

1722
02:06:26,345 --> 02:06:27,380
No, your honor.

1723
02:06:29,381 --> 02:06:35,491
'No' isn't just a word,
it's a complete sentence

1724
02:06:37,456 --> 02:06:44,066
It doesn't need any...

1725
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:51,279
“further explanation

1726
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:55,313
'No' simply means 'NO'.

1727
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:00,190
My clients said 'NO' your honor.

1728
02:07:02,681 --> 02:07:04,592
And these boys must realize...

1729
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:08,563
...that 'no' means 'no'.

1730
02:07:10,389 --> 02:07:18,206
Whether the girl is an acquaintance,
a friend, girlfriend...

1731
02:07:20,733 --> 02:07:22,576
A sex-worker...

1732
02:07:26,372 --> 02:07:28,648
<i>...or</i> even your own wife!

1733
02:07:31,744 --> 02:07:35,191
No means 'NO'!

1734
02:07:38,717 --> 02:07:40,594
And when someone says so...

1735
02:07:45,124 --> 02:07:46,194
You stop.

1736
02:07:57,269 --> 02:07:59,010
We'll take a short break...

1737
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:02,114

has been made in this case.

and even some evidence...

1740
02:08:15,654 --> 02:08:20,228
...against Minal Arora for the case
under section 307; 'Attempt to Murder'...

1741
02:08:20,626 --> 02:08:24,369
...the court finds that
there was grave provocation...

1742
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:30,176
...and dismisses the charge
made against her under section 307.

1743
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:35,182
The charges under section 320 and 324...

1744
02:08:35,274 --> 02:08:41,020
...against Minal Arora,
Falak Ali and Andrea Tariang

1745
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:48,362

1748
02:08:59,665 --> 02:09:06,708

Vishwajyoti Ghosh off with a warning.

1750
02:09:14,012 --> 02:09:17,050

date for further sentencing...

1751
02:09:17,382 --> 02:09:20,522
...and will announce the
quantum of the sentence.

1752
02:09:23,055 --> 02:09:24,363
The court is dismissed.

1753
02:09:33,565 --> 02:09:34,976
