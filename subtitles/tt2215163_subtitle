A human being's sponge-like
lungs are madeto soak up air.

15
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,856
But somepeopleusetheir lungs..

16
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,686
..to soak up the smoke
of Bidis and Cigarettes.

17
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:09,090

00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,979
About 1,000 in amonth.

80% to 90% oral cancer..

23
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,946
..is caused by chewingtobacco.

24
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,523
This is thestory of Mukesh.

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,456
Myname is Mukesh,
l chewed Guthka for 20 years.

26
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,791
Now l havecontracted cancer
and l am being operated upon.

27
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,955
Probablyl won't be
able to speak afterthat.

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,000
Unfortunately Mukesh
did not survive.

29
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,093
And hewas only 24 years old.

30
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,770
Khaini, chewing leaves, Gutkha,
pan masala are all lifethreatening.

31
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,080
Stop Press!

32
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,153
Ms. Pratima,
l've a frontrow view...

33
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,983
...ofthechaos created
bythecity's Sand Mafia.

34
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,023
Legally, the Mallah's
havea right to this sand...

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,824
Awar has erupted between
the two sand-mafias...

36
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,261
... Kashyap and Mishra,
to assert theirright...

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,060
...on this sandworth 500 crores.

38
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,432
The Mallah's are putting
their lifeatstake forthis sand...

39
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,869
The ancestral enmity
between Manohar Mishra...

40
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,305
...and Vishwanarayan Kashyap
is nothing new for our readers.

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,235
Thelatest on it is that
Kashyap's strongman Teeta Singh...

42
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,315
...has laid siege
on this river bank.

43
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,213
And on the other hand Mishra's
men areturning back, disappointed

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,752
This is the fourth riverbank Mishra
has lostin the last few months.

45
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,918
After Mishra's beloved
son Rahul left thebattlefield...

46
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,964
...there's no onewho
can challenge Teeta Singh.

47
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,228
Ms. Pratima,
please publish every word l said...

48
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,232
...in tomorrow's paper.

49
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,846
That's Kashyap's truck.

50
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,074
Let's takea closer look.

51
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,777
Let's get our hands
on whateverwecan.

52
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,580
Let's settle the scores today.

53
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,348
Kashyap's pups.

54
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,821
Now wehavethem on
our mark... Drive faster.

55
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,482
You're not goingto slip away,
are you?

56
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,854
Don't worry about me.

57
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,825
You're the onel'm
worried aboutmost.

58
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,260
Let's go. Let's go.

59
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,693
Whatare you doing, rascals?

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,462
Slow down!

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,406
Who startedtheargument?
- They started it.

62
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,642
Saveus, Lord Bajrang Bali.

63
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,163
Sir, theywork for Mishra.

64
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,889
l capturedthesand bank.

65
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,762
l took careofthe 'Mallahs'.

66
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,829
Now, you turn up to
play the 'showstoppers'?

67
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,847
Hail Baba Dukharan Singh!

68
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,153
Hegot away sir!

69
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,179
God save us!

70
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,388
Uncle. Kashyap and
Mishra are on the line.

71
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,492
l admire your courage.

72
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,766
You'retrying to betray
your own benefactor.

73
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,233
Royalty is long gone.

74
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,271
lt's democracy now.

75
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,340
l can lose this position anymoment.

76
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,068
And, our relation
can fall apartanytime.

77
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,611
Two ofmy important
men aredead, sir.

78
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,510
This isn'tthefirsttimel've
suffered losses becauseof Kashyap.

79
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,777
Weneed to stop thesered flags.

80
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,682
Otherwise,theyll spread their
influenceall theway to thecity.

81
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,848
Heis using the Maoists as an excuse
to take overthe entireriver bank...

82
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,789
Sort out your personal
differences first.

83
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,794
Otherwise you two will
end up killing each other.

84
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,429
This cannotgo on.

85
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,998
Bring my gun to me!

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,692
No need fora gun.

87
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,666
At this age, you need a stick.

88
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,534
That's theonly way
to shut up that Mishra.

89
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,300
Brother-in-law, l am there.

90
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,937
Just keep the Minister happy.

91
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,238
And, l'll deal with Mishra.

92
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,120
Minister sir, it is people
like Mishra and the Moaists...

93
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,687
... who spreadthedisturbance.

94
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,684
Teeta wentto Majhi Tola
to solvethat very problem.

95
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,090
Teeta Singh's alwayw on ahigh.

96
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,487
What did he think hewas doing,

97
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,597
practising his shooting skills
publicly on theGanga Bridge?

98
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,258
Minister sir, l...
- Listen to me.

99
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,093
lfl hearof another
such incident...

100
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,535
...then,
consider this allianceover.

101
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,333
At leastspare this city.

102
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,505
Uncle, can l come in?

103
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,980
Uncle, l was saying...

104
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,388
Murari!

105
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:27,066
Unclehas assured there
will bepeacein the city. Okay!

106
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,234
And, why do you come
here for every small problem?

107
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,705
lfunclehas to deal
with thesethings too...

108
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,338
...what are the police
going to do all day?.

109
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,115
Bihata. How did Teetas
come to Majhi Tola?

110
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,450
Uncle. l had gonepreoared.

111
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,689
Whilereturning,
weran into Teeta Singh's gang.

112
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,023
You know l don't like
getting into fights.

113
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,653
But hestarted brandishing his LMG!

114
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,059
Bullets rained from both sides

115
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,723
Bam! Bang!

116
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,529
l picked up my gun.

117
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,727
But it got stuck

118
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,136
So did lt finally work?

119
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,503
lt did.And how!

120
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,410
Afterthat, l started
firing and caused a frenzy.

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,545
But l couldn't save Paras and Surta.

122
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,550
Where's Rahul?
- Take alook in his room.

123
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,449
His highness must be
getting his beauty sleep.

124
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,078
What's wrongwith the boy?

125
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,484
Hehasn't been himselflately.

126
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,648
And doesn't pay any
attention to work either.

127
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,659
And that Teetahas
been expanding business.

128
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,591
Good hedidn't go with us, uncle.

129
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,095
Brother's turned
into a righteous man.

130
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,926
Hehas renounced violence
to recitepoetry.

131
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,662
You could've tried to ask him,
if you cared.

132
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,397
And did l not ask?

133
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,405
But hedoesn't wantto talk.

134
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,975
Do you expectmeto pamper him?

135
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,838
Kill them! Kill them all!

136
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,140
Father!

137
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,371
Bihata!

138
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,508
Run! Flee!

139
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,156

140
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:24,781

Lal Salaam!

143
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,026
Don't let anyone escape.

144
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,671
Every part ofmeburns,

145
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,368
Every cell ofmybeing is scorched

146
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,377
Father!

147
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,550
Thestream ofblood pierces me

148
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,920

Akiss to you, my beloved.

150

This war's gone on

151
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,077
lt's as if a soul
has risen within menow

152
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,650
lt's as ifl have
rebelled against myself.

153
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,950
This bird wants to fly,

154
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,858
even as peopleare
readyto shoot it down.

155
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:44,100

That crazy ascetic

He says...
- What?

177
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,417
Real love is experienced from here.

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,244
Notthere.

179
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,814
Onesecond.

180
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,654
l'm not interested in these fights,
Mr Nandkishore.

181
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,596
But Teeta believes that Mishra...

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,528
...killed his only sister, i.e.
mywife.

183
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,871
Myfirst wife.

184
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,170
Oh.

185
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,581
You should keep an AK47.

186
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,721
lt's the real thing.

187
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,759
Brother, l can'treally
takemy personal weapon to work.

188

Let metalk to Bachchi.

189
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,859
That way he can settle down as well.

190
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,660
What do you say?

191
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,927

Namaste.

201
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,884
Deliverthem? To whom?

202
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,928
He knows l can'tread English...

203
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,466
l wonder why the master
lets these foreigners stayhere.

204
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,897
Shameless! Unclean people!

205
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,532
Rahul!

206
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,723
Come!

207
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,627
You two sinners, heretoo.

208
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,934
To find alover, you need to
look in thewomen's quarter.

209
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,058
See this..

210
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,371
You'll get in trouble someday.

211
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,107
Murari, these foreigners
are broad-minded.

212
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,002
lfl had bumped into herfirst...

213
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,104
...then l would be
getting luckytoday.

214
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,509
Butthere's onething.

215
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,184
This is called 'Sleeping
with the enemy'!

216
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,311
Betterthan father's punishment.

217
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,653
Whiteskin has its allure,
l must say.

218
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,285
Hey!

219
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,629
Are you marrying her?

220
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,622
Do you takeme for a Romeo?

221
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,594
Darn it. l think it's over now.

222
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,204
Shewants to bean ascetic.

223
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,835
Talk of fasting after feasting!

224
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,639
There's no cureto your problem.

225
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,808
There's a cure to
every problem, Murari.

226
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,011
To counter aknife you need agun.
For a gun you need abomb;

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,519
For abomb, cannons;
for cannons amissile;

228
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,452

229
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,657
Find someone else.

230
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,392
What do you see in these
emaciated foreigners anyway?.

231
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,926
You didn't get it.

232
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,333
Find a bigger 'problem'...

233
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,266
...that will automatically
curethe'smaller' ones.

234
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,841
How about l break your leg?

235
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,603
lt will curethepain in your balls.

236
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,939
Have you really lost your mind?

237
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,512
Don'tlaugh, he's unpredictable.

238
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,275
Son? Can you read?

But all l have is amother.

266

What do webrothers do
to become 'important enough'?

267
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:46,223
You need to mix right ingredients...

268
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,858
...to get theright potion.

269
00:17:54,273 --> 00:18:00,872

But l am nottalking about her.

Till the other day,
your heart beat only for Rosa.

00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,249
Today, you forget even hername.

632
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,216
But you only wanted me...

633
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,450
...to end all ties with Rosa.

634
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,251
So you ended onechapter...

...and started anew one.

636
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,327
And, a violent oneat that.

637
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,260

At yourage,
Alexander had conqueredtheworld.

And at yourage, Aristotlebecame
the world's greatest philosopher.

That wise man was right after all.

00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:43,341
'Loveis sea offire,

847
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,407

856
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,838
Whether l was being

857
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,877
Or now?

858
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:18,745
Careful!

859
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,816
Rahul's busy flirtingwith girls.

00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,184
Murari, l'm protecting the family...

864
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,089

Teeta would've attacked thehouse...

865
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,953
...and carried ourwomen away.

866
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,832

To understandthis,
you'll needto know about love.

877

You see, l've chewed

Buthe's already laid down his weapon.

00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,310
Seems likethis new avatar

00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,706

00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,389
Bachchi...

905
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,807
More than 40 extremists
attacked us, uncle!

906
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,277
Everyone fled,
but l fought them alone.

907
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,205
l managed to save
this onewith difficulty.

908
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,582
Don't worry.

909
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,718
Hear my plan.

910
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,487
We'll gather all the
Maoists around this one..

911
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,286
..andthen pull thepin.

912
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,356
Notrightnow, uncle.

913
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,861
But where was Rahul?

914
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,469
Uncle,
l thought brother's back on the job.

915
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,998
Butl think he's lost
his valourfor good.

916
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,798
l see.

917
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:13,106
Dangers havebecome apart oflife

918
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:19,481
l keep walking but reach nowhere.

919
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:25,583
My dreams hover in my eyes

920
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:31,731
Only to rush outas memories flow in.

921
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:37,568
Wecannot control thecircumstances

922
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:44,178
Therearesecrets hidden in thestars

923
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:50,319
l'm surethere's
apurposeto our love.

924
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,992
Loving you is like
holding a fistful of sand...

925
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:20,007
l stand on this side oftheriver,
while you on theother

926
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:26,146
l have a feeling
we'll drown this time

927
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:33,561
l haveno idea where
your love is leading me.

928
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:47,937
Anything that does not
have your reference...

929
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:54,046
...seems meaningless to me.

930
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:12,065
Every inch ofmybeing has opened up

931
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:19,233
Your love falls like
a shower on my parched soul.

932
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,869
Might...

933
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,372
...is right!

934
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,481
Think aboutthe future.

935
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,820
l'vebeen telling you,
let's move forward.

936
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,396
l mean have you planned anything?

937
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,693
Where are wegoing to live,
after marriage?

938
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,931
l didn't know we'regetting married?

939
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,497
Obviously,
we'regetting married at somepoint.

940
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:05,343
lfthis goes on, unclewill
get me marriedto that Pritam.

941
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,848
l can'tbelike Pritam.

942
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,177
And l...

943
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,311
Can't livelike Paro and uncle.

944
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,724
Paro and uncle? What?

945
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,026
Peopleget married even
when theyre not in love.

946
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,255
Justto show the world.

947
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,861
Rahul!

948
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,231
Our families can deny ourlove.

949
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:31,837
But...

950
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,039
But...they can't deny ourmarriage.

951
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,509
l can'tgetmarried.

952
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,414
Forthen l'll have to
spend my entirelifewith you.

953
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,343
That's true.

954
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:47,384
Better make up your mind now.

955
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,422
l'll keep you tied...

956
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:51,921
You'rescaring me.

957
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:00,535
You'll also get special
prizes on ourfirst night.

958

Whatprizes?

959
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,637
l'm notgoing to tell you like that.

960
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,666
Wait.

961
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,942
l'm... a virgin.

962
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,113
Take them away.

963
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,915
Don'tlet them escape.
- Yes, sir.

964
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,518
How are you feeling, brother?

965
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,751
Better now.

966
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:24,955
Did you seethat?.

967
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,254
Yes.

968
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,355
Hey, Bachchi !

969
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,148
What's wrong, brother?

970
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:52,945
Nothing.

971
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,820
Something got into my eyes.

972
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,425
Hail Baba Dukhran!

973
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:03,923
Showing off?.

974
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,272

01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,498
now we'll put it to use...

976
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,270
Just let them steo out ofthecity...

977
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,676
Wecan't wait forthem to step out.

978
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,778
We'll barge into theirhomes...

979
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,548
We'll needto bargeinto
their homes and kill them.

980
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,434
Lal Salaam!

981
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,612

Hetricked us again.

987

989
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:27,765
Gentlemen!

990
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,806

991
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,741
Hello.

Therearetwo people here.

994
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,856
lf you talk to just one,
what's theother goingto do?

995
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,583
Kick your butt?

996
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:46,490
l'll question the one who behaves...

997
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,165
...and answer theonewho misbehaves.

998
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,860
You'rereally good atthis business.

999
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:57,094
Why don't you setup a shop?

1000
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,434
Murari.

1001
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,010
These days you danceto Rahul's tunes.

1002
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,446
Do you take me for a nautch-girl?

1003
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,775
Hold on...

1004
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,411
Let me show you what aman l am...

Therearetoo many people around.

1006
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,657
Don't tryto show anything.

1007
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,125
We can deal with this later.

1008
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,729
Where's Mishra's son?

1009
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,060
Who? Rahul?

1010
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:28,497
Right behind your back.

1011
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:34,868
Where's mine...?

1012
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,845
Your uncle's already
warned us, Murari.

1013
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,439
You've already defeated
Teeta Singh once...

1014
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,710
...now, it's my turn.

1015
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,279
lsn't that right?

1016
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,917
What are you saying, Murari?

1017
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,515
l think we have had
too much to drink today.

1018
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:53,888
Heisn't here, sir.

1019
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:00,432
Tell that kid, he's made
the biggest mistakeofhis life.

1020
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,001
l will.

1021
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,548
lf you like Pritam,
let's get on with theengagement.

1022
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,348
Why arewe delaying it?

1023

1024
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,121
Oncethats done,

Move out.

1026
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,131
Congratulations, Bachchi.

1027
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,997
Feeling shy!

1028
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:47,205

01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,972
'Bachchi's not scared of anyone.'

1032
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,948
'Mishra's son is so stupid.'

1033
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,017
'He killed so many people...'

1034
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:34,528
'...and lefthis father's
licensed gun back in the field.'

1035
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,893
'l'll fix him for good.'

1036
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,006

Yes. Of course shewill.

1043
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,137
Where's Rahul Mishra's gun?

1044
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,137
Where's thegun?

1045
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,673
lt's somewherearound.

1046
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,381
Where's his gun?

1047
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,146
Where's his gun?

1048
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,117
Where's Bachchi?

1049
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,697

1062

A human being's sponge-like
lungs are madeto soak up air.

1063
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,916
But somepeopleusetheir lungs..

1064
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,610
..to soak up the smoke
of Bidis and Cigarettes.

1065
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:51,059

..you will findthis much of
cancer-producingtar in his lungs.

1067
01:13:56,398 --> 01:14:03,031
This much taris enough
to make you sick.. very sick.

1068
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,640
l see50 new patients every day.

1069
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,435
About 1,000 in amonth.

1070
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,838
80% to 90% oral cancer..

1071
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,445
..is caused by chewingtobacco.

1072
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,071
This is thestory of Mukesh.

1073
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,912
Myname is Mukesh,
l chewed Guthka for 20 years.

1074
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,248
Now l havecontracted cancer
and l am being operated upon.

1075
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,514
Probably l won'tbe able
to speak after that.

1076
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,352
Unfortunately Mukesh
did not survive.

1077
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,583
And hewas only 24 years old.

1078
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:31,489
Khaini, chewing leaves, Gutkha,
pan masala are all lifethreatening.

1079
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,178
Murari!

1080
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,731
Lord Shiva..

1081
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,232

Have you lost your mind, Rahul.

1122

Think about your
father's reoutation.

1123
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,828

Are you okay?
- Yes Brother.

lt's a small hole.

1146
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,051
You know what that means?

1147
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,688
Don't worry.

1148
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,952
lt's a small wound.
All you need is aband-aid.

1149
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,688
No, whatl need is a shroud.

1150
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,799
Call a doctor.

1151
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,070
Rightaway.
- lt's no good now.

1152
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:08,801
Murari.

1153
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:13,074
l spent my entirelife
being a friend to you.

1154
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,244
l wanted to makethings right.

1155
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,282
Damn the Mishras and Kashyaps.

1156
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:24,148
Take me away from here.

1157
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,819
Murari!

1158
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,156
Murari!

1159
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:40,040
Murari!

1160
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:46,976
Murari!

1161
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,252
Murari!

1162
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,922
He's dead, for nothing.

1163
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,290
Wewon'tspare Teeta.

1164
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,174
We're so unlucky.

1165
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:25,184
lfwehad used our brains,
hewould bedead now.

1166
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:29,820
Get out ofthecar!

1167
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:23,605
Likeatrue friend he
stood by you in this world.

1168
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,847
Now you can support
him in theother one.

1169
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:29,348
l haveto admire your audacity.

1170
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:34,683
You kill Murari and actually
find the nerveto comeback.

1171
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,959
l can'tsayl'm happy
about Murari's death.

1172
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:44,224
But if you survive,
his death will go waste.

1173
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,700
l heard you were brave.

1174
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,496
But you turned out to bea coward.

1175
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:56,437
l wouldn't havelet Murari's
murder go unavenged.

1176
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,408
But there is something
that stops me.

1177
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:04,516
lf you had contained your
lust with that foreigner...

1178
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:08,213
...l might even have
spared your life.

1179
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,921
l will live.

1180
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,830
My life's moreprecious
forsomeone else.

1181
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:22,026
Your dream...

1182
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,864
...will never cometrue.

1183
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,535
l won't let it.

1184
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,711
Bachchi and l got married.

1185
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,858
lfwhat you say is true,

1186
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:53,197
then Bachchi too will die.

1187
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,715
Rahul!

1188
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:49,151
Get out ofhere!

1189
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,248
l'll handle the situation here!

1190
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,817
Throw thegun in the river!

1191
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,523
Go!

1192
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,633
'God is theonly truth'

1193
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,140
'God is theonly truth'

1194
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,473
'God is theonly truth'

1195
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,013
'God is theonly truth'

1196
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,379
'God is theonly truth'

1197
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,850
'God is theonly truth'

1198
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,251
'God is theonly truth'

'God is theonly truth'

1201
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,025
'God is theonly truth'

1202
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:44,931
Baba.

1203
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,439
l can'trun awaylikethis.

1204
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,406
lt's not about running away.

1205
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:51,706
Rightnow, it's best you
stay away from thecity.

1206
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,906
You'rein danger from
both Kashyap andthepolice.

1207
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,080
Theyhave forgotten
what l'm capable of.

1208
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,085
But l haven't.

1209
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,287
lfl haveto leave
l'll take Bachchi along.

1210
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,881
Don't be a fool.

1211
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,190
Otherwise, you'll lose
both Bachchi and yourlife..

1212
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:10,926
You'll never understand, Baba!

1213
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,265
You spent halfyour
lifein the Himalayas.

1214
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,938
spending the rest meditating.

1215
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,468
Rahul...

1216
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:24,110
You have not fired indiscriminately
at people on your father's orders...

1217
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:31,349
...onlyto realizethat
you areworth no more...

1218
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,215
...than the bodies lying around.

1219
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,086
You havenever loved agirl so much...

1220
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:41,655
...that you forsake everything
forthis onebond...

1221
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,061
...and realisethat
you're losing that too.

1222
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,801
l used to bejust like you.

1223
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,766
Anyway,whether l
understand you or not...

1224
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,969
...l'm pleasedto know that you do.

1225
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,176
But, Rahul.

1226
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:03,211
You'veto leave before
dawn tomorrow.

1227
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:08,521
Your father has arranged
for a safe-house.

1228
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,758
l don't need his help.

1229
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,092
Baba.

1230
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:16,923
Baba.

1231
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:17,861
Come.

1232
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,900
We were just talking about Bachchi.

1233
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,096
How's Bachchi,Amma?

1234
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:23,295
What do you expect?

1235
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:27,966
She misses her uncle
and Rahul alike.

1236
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:32,069
Have you told anyone
about this marriage?

1237
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,545
No.

1238
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,341
Then Bachchi's safe here.

1239
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:39,011
Come back oncethe
situation calms down.

1240
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,368
l made...

1241
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,971
...a big mistake.

1242
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,816
You saved mylife.

1243
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,620
You did everything you could.

1244
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:20,755
l didn't wantto hurt you.

1245
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,923
You even married me for my sake.

1246
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:30,400
Whether anyone believes it or not,
l'll always believein it.

1247
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:45,976
Uncle.

1248
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:48,055
Don't think yourself
to be alone in this.

1249
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,362
The police are acting
like Kashyap's cronies.

1250
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:03,403
They are after Rahul's life.

1251
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:05,938
Hewanted to avenge
his friend's death...

1252
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,234
Sir.

1253
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,135
l'm upset about Murari too.

1254
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:13,470
But Mishra's son startedthis mess.

1255
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,481
l want to give Rahul a chance.

1256
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,711
This isn't justice.

1257
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:22,322
Listen to me.

1258
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:25,158
Aterriblething has happened here.

1259
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:26,351
Terrible.

01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:29,056
Minister.

1261
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:33,224
Members of our families have
died because of Mishra's son.

1262
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,733
He should be given death too.

1263
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:41,771
Do you really think
this kid could kill Teetas?

1264
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,509
ltwas all a pre-planned
and pre-meditated murder.

1265
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,345
lf you can't do justice,
leave it to us and see

1266
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,280
how we women can handle things.

1267
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:51,677
Look.

1268
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,715
Murari lost his life
in your personal feud.

1269
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,220
Rahul will leave.
- Yes.

1270
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,918

01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:14,256
Lover.

1286
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:15,589
Loser.

Sensible.

1290
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:22,099
Stubborn.

For you.

1292
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,236
Selfish.

l'vegiven up everything.

1294
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:40,579
Everymemory...

1296
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:56,359

...call me back whenever you want.

1311
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,328
Bachchi!

1312
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:03,896
lt's dawn. Everyone's awake.

1313
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,731
Lord Bholenath.

1314
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,669
We'll know the wrong from
right onlyin the next world.

1315
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:10,611
Police.

1316
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:11,803
Police?

1317
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,374

God Promise.

1320

Promise.

1321
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:07,823
Sometimes it's silken
and sometimes rough

1322
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:13,789
Onemoment it flows,
thenext it stays still

1323
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:20,897
Loving you is like
holding a fistful of sand...

1324
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:23,602
l had started thinking
my son was alost cause.

1325
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:28,546
But with a singleblow you
havenearly destroyed theenemy.

1326
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:31,550
Well done.

1327
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:33,312
Son!

1328
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:35,385
No onewill know where you are.

1329
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:36,849
Exceot for me.

1330
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:39,924
For amonth ortwo,
you'll stay cut-off from theworld.

1331
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:43,324
lf you need anything,
just let me know.

1332
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:48,966
There are fivebullets
still leftin this gun.

1333
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,231
Which means Murari
didn't shoot Teetas.

1334
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,799
Someoneelse did.
- Are you crazy?.

1335
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,474
Keep it inside.
You might need it.

1336
01:37:12,426 --> 01:37:13,518
What's wrong?

1337
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:16,124
Are you still mourning for Teetas?

1338
01:37:17,398 --> 01:37:19,457
Do you want cry your heart out?

1339
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:21,993
He's not coming back.

1340
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,431
lt's natural to mourn
for onewho's gone.

1341
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:28,164
l'll feel somepeace,
oncethekiller is dead.

1342
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,240
He's beyond myreach.

1343
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:33,011
Otherwise,
l would'vedealtwith him.

1344
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:42,919
Rahul Mishra will be hacked
to death and fed to thedogs.

1345
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,991
Will that make you happy?

1346
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:47,952
l will behappy onlywhen
l see him with my own eyes.

1347
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:51,324
He shouldn'thave been sent away.

1348
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,856
We'll find him alright.

1349
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:57,597

Your father has fixed your marriage.

1352
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:03,270
With Pritam.

1353
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,808
What's the hurry?

1354
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:10,740

1355
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:14,186
And even Rahul Mishra

1356
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:16,222
...than that Pritam.

1363
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:33,830
No.

1364
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:36,229
lt's too noisy.

1365
01:39:55,322 --> 01:40:02,956
Myheart is unable
to figureoutthis riddle

1366
01:40:03,597 --> 01:40:13,472

1368
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:21,312
Pain alone is our mate

1369

No one's fit to do anything.

1377
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,616
Only you can avengethis death.

1378
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:41,488
Teetas had accepted
you as theson-in-law.

1379
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:43,490
Not that Mishra's son.

1380
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:56,742
Things have gonetoo far.

01:41:57,511 --> 01:41:59,138

Hewalked really fast.

1397
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,515
Trying to catch up with him,
the British ended up

1398
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:45,955
walking out ofthe country.

1399
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:48,226
Gandhiji's stick.

1400
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:50,262
Hewalked really fast.

1401
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:51,922
Trying to catch up with him,
the British ended up

1402
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:53,259
walking out ofthe country.

1403
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:54,959
l see. Then?

1404
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:57,002
TheQueen ofJhansi played
aroletoo.

1405
01:42:57,638 --> 01:42:59,572
Shewas an expert swordswoman.

1406
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:02,836
One wave ofher sword brought...

1407
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:04,841
Onewave ofher sword...

1408
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:06,674
...brought down a dozen enemies.

01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:09,578
...down halfa dozen enemies.

1410
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:14,314
ln which year did the queen
ofJhansi die, Ms. Kashyap?

1411
01:43:14,454 --> 01:43:18,390
ln thesame yearwhen the
gallant Maharana Pratap was born.

1412
01:43:18,492 --> 01:43:20,926
Whenever he felt extremely sad...

1413
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,553
...for not being ableto participate
in the freedom struggle.

1414
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:27,060
Tansen would sing
theraga 'Todi' for him.

1415
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:29,995
Tansen sung the
'Todi Raag' for him...

1416
01:43:30,137 --> 01:43:33,937
...which later became the national
anthem of our secular reoublic.

1417
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:37,636
Aren't you forgetting Kishore Kumar?

1418
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,073
Of course, sir.
- You tell him.

1419
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:40,976
Weshouldn't forget Bhagat Singh.

Heslapped the daylights
out ofthe British and shouted..

1421
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:46,752
''British go back! British go back!''

1422
01:45:05,098 --> 01:45:08,329

You will be. Tomorrow.

But can l say something?

1560
01:57:03,082 --> 01:57:04,549
You shouldn't cry so much?

1561
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:06,613
lt makes your face look lifeless.

1562
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:08,748
My face is lifeless.

lt's an organo-phosphatecompound.

1580
01:57:53,299 --> 01:57:54,391

Givemetime to think.

1585
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,171
'Alakh Niranjan!'

1586
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:19,886
There's onesolution.

1587

You have to drink something.

Not poison.

1589
01:58:23,162 --> 01:58:25,096

Of course your family won't
get you married in thatstate.

1600
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:48,946

The groom will walk to
his wedding like aking.

1630
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:45,153
He'll not care
for his brother-in-law

1631
02:01:45,264 --> 02:01:51,999
And he'll ignore all his uncles.

1632

dancing, to thewedding.

Only agirl's father can ever know

1643
02:03:00,873 --> 02:03:06,368
The pain of a vacant house
after his daughter is gone.

1644
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:12,975
Themother's tears

02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:34,553
Baba's sent a message.

1659
02:05:44,904 --> 02:05:46,599
