'Our story starts on the tallest
mountain of the Himalayas..

22

..the Kailash mountain.'

'Lord Ganesh's father
Lord Shiv Shankar..

24
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,072
..and Mother Parvati live here.'

00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:55,606
'The biggest devotee of
Lord Shiva is Nandi,

26
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,611
..and he has a big
army of devotees.'

27
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:04,287
'Our sweet child Ganesh's
story starts from here.'

28
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,630
'Once Mother Parvati
said to Nandi bull.'

29
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,504
Nandi, I am going in my
palace to take a bath.

30
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:31,508
Until I don't give the permission,
don't let anyone enter the palace.

31
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:33,977
As you wish, Mother.

32
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,174
Hail Bholenath!

33
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,711
Move from my way.

34
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,990
Please excuse me Shiva Shankar,
but Mother Parvati..

35
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,516
..has asked me not to let anyone in.

36
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,586
You fool, this order is for others.

37
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,062
I am her husband.

38
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,391
Move!

39
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,060
How did you come in?

40
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,062
Didn't Nandi stop you?

41
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,667
Dear, he is my devotee.

42
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:04,796
He doesn't have the
courage to stop me.

43
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,129
I had asked him to stay on guard.

44
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:11,268
He shouldn't have disobeyed
my orders like this.

45
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:15,545
But I am your husband, what's
the use of stopping me.

46
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:22,081
You are right Lord, but Nandi's
disobeying of my orders..

47
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,213
..is not a dutiful thing to do.

48
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,814
Don't be angry dear forgive him.

49
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,088
He is a bit dimwit.

50
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,709
'No! Nandi didn't do
that right thing.'

51
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,185
'But what could he have done.'

52
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,179
'After all, he is the
devotee of his Lord.'

53
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,523
'He didn't have the courage
to stop his Lord.'

54
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:04,787
'I need a devotee, who is
intelligent, courageous..

55
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,591
..and follows my orders. And I will
create such a devotee, myself.'

56
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:17,928
With this strange pledge
in her mind.

57
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,264
Mother Gauri initialised
her efforts.

58
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,269
With this strange pledge
in her mind.

59
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,282
Mother Gauri initialised
her efforts.

60
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:38,290
Om! Om!

61
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,820
Om Namah Shivay!

62
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,233
Om Namah Shivay!

63
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:56,365
Om Namah Shivay!

64
00:09:58,244 --> 00:10:02,305
Om Namah Shivay!

65
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:18,322
From her body.

66
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:26,328
From her soft tender motherly
love filled heart.

67
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:33,675
Collected every element
from every part.

68
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:41,285
And then picked it in her arms.

69
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:52,894
Mother created a fair child.

70
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,295
That would bring glory

71
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:59,361
..to every part of the universe
with his qualities.

72
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,368
With a miracle Mother
brought him to life.

73
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:11,511
And with a smile came Lord Ganesh.

74
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,460
Mother.

75
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,571
We have to be more alert.

76
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:17,899
He can be anywhere near. Be alert.

77
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:30,713
Here.

78
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,459
Come, come.

79
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,212
Ganesh. Son Ganesh.

80
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,611
Yes mother.

81
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,229
Son Ganesh.
- Yes mother.

82
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,106
Son, I am going to take a bath.

83
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,969
Sit at the door, and until
I don't tell you..

84
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:29,242
..let no one come in.
- As you wish, mother.

85
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,983
I will let no one come in.

86
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,178
Please take your bath.

87
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:40,922
Will you forget while playing?
- No mother, don't worry.

88
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,745
Please excuse me Lord,
but you cannot go in.

89
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:07,281
Child, who are you and why
are you stopping me?

90
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,548
I am the son of Gauri, Ganesh.

91
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,288
And I am following
my mother's orders.

92
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,554
It is her orders that, until
she doesn't give permission..

93
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,032
..no should be allowed to go in.

94
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:27,036
Son of Gauri. Then these
orders are not for me..

95
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,037
..because I am the husband
of Gauri, Shiv Shankar.

96
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,647
Please move from the door, child.

97
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,848
No! Until mother doesn't
give me the permission..

98
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,782
..I will not allow anyone to go in.

99
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,781
Don't be stubborn adolescent child.

100
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,650
Move from the way!

101
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:49,788
That's impossible.

102
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:52,322
You don't know my anger.

103
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:56,193
Move from the way, or else the
consequences will be grave.

104
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,203
No matter what the consequences
will be!

105
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,999
The sun can rise from the west.

106
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,334
The moon can change its path.

107
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:07,076
But I can never turn
away from my duty.

108
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,009
Foolish child!

109
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,675
Calm down, calm down Lord.

110
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:16,279
He is just a small child. I will
explain to him and move him.

111
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,227
If he doesn't understand,
then use force.

112
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:34,034
Child Ganesh, you don't
know my Lord's anger.

113
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:38,243
Don't blabber, if you have the
courage then try and move me.

114
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,041
Don't challenge me child!

115
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,649
You are a coward.

116
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,376
Is that so!

117
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,847
Then face my strength.

118
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,449
He defeated me! He defeated me!

119
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:53,976
Commander-in-chief!

120
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:58,855
Go along with your army and
defeat that stubborn child!

121
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:00,724
As you wish Lord.

122
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,251
Come on.

123
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:06,923
There he is.

124
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,876
Terrible! Absolutely terrible!

125
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,278
What is Lord Shankar doing
in a fit of rage!

126
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,356
Instead of appeasing child
Ganesh tenderly..

127
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:46,023
..he has sent an army of his
devotees to defeat him.

128
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,899
I will have to interfere.

129
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,103
Stop!

130
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,045
What is this foolishness?

131
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,582
So many of you are
fighting one child!

132
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:13,983
Move back!

133
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:28,065
Son Ganesh, you shouldn't
be stubborn too.

134
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,007
I am not being stubborn, father is.

135
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,872
You should obey your
father's orders.

136
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,879
Move from the path.

137
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:40,545
If I follow father's orders, then
what about mother's orders.

138
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:45,287
And I can never disobey
my mother's orders.

139
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,549
Don't be stubborn.

140
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:50,289
You should listen to your elders,
move from the path.

141
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:53,896
For me, the highest position
is my mother.

142
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,967
I will not move!

143
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,629
'I will have to use cunningness
to move him.'

144
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:04,972
'Or else, if Lord Shankar is angry
a terrible thing will happen.'

145
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:10,371
Child, move from the way and
you will get a reward.

146
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,984
Giving the greed of rewards
you want to appease me.

147
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,519
It doesn't suit you Lord Brahma.

148
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:20,116
Don't teach me child, move
from the way or else..

149
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:23,921
Now you are threatening me,
but I will not be scared!

150
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:27,331
'I will have to use strength
to bring him in control.'

151
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,601
I will have to punish you.

152
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:17,047
'It won't be right to use the
Brahma weapon on this child.'

153
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,528
Something very terrible
is going to happen!

154
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:52,592
What happened, Lord? Why
did you get restless?

155
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:54,598
Is everything fine?

156
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:59,132
Devi, Lord Shankar's anger
has reached it's peak..

157
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,736
..and he is doing the Tandav dance.

158
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:03,875
Shiv Shankar is doing
the Tandav dance.

159
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,884
Then surely there is going
to be a grave situation.

160
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:15,226
Yes, we have to quickly go to
Kailash to calm him down.

161
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:18,357
Lord, I will come
along with you too.

162
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,698
That way, I will meet
sister Parvati too.

163
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:06,802
Husband killed my son!

164
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:14,343
Son Ganesh!

165
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,354
Son Ganesh!

166
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:53,848
What have you done, My Lord?

167
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:56,788
In anger, you killed your own son.

168
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,527
And all of you Gods, just
kept watching it quietly.

169
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,340
No one took mercy on this
adolescent child!

170
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:15,337
Was it so important to defeat
this small child?

171
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,008
That all the Gods
have gathered here!

172
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:24,278
Tell me, why are you all quiet?

173
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,490
Has your anger been appeased, by
slaying this adolescent child?

174
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:35,756
If not, then kill me too!

175
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,497
I want my son back, alive.

176
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,436
You will have to return
him his life!

177
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:50,042
Or else, I will give up my life too!

178
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,318
What are you saying Devi?

179
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,048
I am asking for justice.

180
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,447
My son was innocent.

181
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,586
He was following my orders.

182
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,524
Forgive me Devi, that's impossible.

183
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,523
Then it is impossible
for me to stay alive.

184
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:15,529
If right now my son is not
brought back to life..

185
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,409
..then I will give up my life too.

186
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:23,405
In anger, you killed your
own son Bholenath.

187
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,546
Now you will have to accept
Parvati's request..

188
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:30,421
..and bring child Ganesh
back to life.

189
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:36,419
Or else, the fire of her anger
will destroy the entire world.

190
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,090
Devi Parvati's request
is not absurd.

191
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,359
The irrational deed that
you have done in anger..

192
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:48,964
..this can be the only way to
repent for it, Bholenath.

193
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:55,569
Forget your arrogance, and accept
Devi Parvati's request, Bholenath.

194
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:58,913
That's not possible.

195
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:04,982
Once beheaded by my weapon, cannot
be brought back together again.

196
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,461
Then there is only solution.

197
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:20,405
Another child's head, who hasn't
been beheaded by your weapons..

198
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:22,406
..can be given to child Ganesh.

199
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,483
Don't waste time in thinking,
order your devotees quickly.

200
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:40,422
Go, and bring a child's head who
is facing towards the north..

201
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:46,692
..and his mother is sleeping with
her back turned towards the child.

202
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,033
As you wish, Lord.

203
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:51,493
Don't delay.

204
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,437
If time runs out, then he
will never come alive again.

205
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,771
As you wish, Lord. Come, let's go.

206
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,617
Fools, what have you brought!

207
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:54,555
Lord, according to the
orders that you had given..

208
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,958
..this is the only child
that we could find.

209
00:31:57,162 --> 00:31:59,153
We have brought his head.

210
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,033
There is no time to think,
Bholenath.

211
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:06,765
Attach this head and bring
child Ganesh back to life.

212
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:27,316
Om!

213
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:30,993
Om!

214
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:35,999
Om Namah Shivay!

215
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:41,800
Om Namah Shivay!

216
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,798
Mother.

217
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,296
Look dear, he is back to life.

218
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,707
You brought him alive Lord,
but seeing him in this form..

219
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:30,373
..everyone will make fun of him.

220
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,250
Don't worry dear, nothing
like that sort will happen.

221
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:42,725
I bestow him with a boon, that
people will worship him for ages.

222
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,862
This exceptional child will work
for the welfare of the earthlings.

223
00:34:56,808 --> 00:35:01,745
I bestow him with a boon, whenever
an auspicious deed is done..

224
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:05,749
..Ganesh will be venerated first.

225
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,758
This child will be the giver
of knowledge and intelligence.

226
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,227
He will be established
in every temple and home.

227
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,495
People will always
feed him sweets.

228
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,983
My son will be very
strong and intelligent.

229
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,793
From today I appoint him
as the commander-in-chief..

230
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:55,196
..of my army of devotees.

231
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,822
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

232
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:28,827
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

233
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,830
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

234
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:36,431
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

235
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:40,299
No holding back, lets hear it
for him once more friends.

236
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,312
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

237
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:46,180
No holding back, lets hear it
for him once more friends.

238
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:48,043
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

239
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,047
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

240
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:52,052
Hail.
- Lord Ganesha!

241
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,615
Mother, I am very hungry.

242
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:33,415
Please give me something to eat.

243
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,687
Here son, have this fruit.

244
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:38,956
I don't want to eat fruits,
I want sweets.

245
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:42,291
Glutton, why do you
eat so many sweets?

246
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,292
Here.

247
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,631
Just two, it won't even
go down the throat.

248
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,168
Okay, have two more. Okay.

249
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:56,571
And for this mouse, will
he just look at my mouth.

250
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:58,714
Will this mouse eat sweets,

251
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,176
Here, you have it too.

252
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,693
Mr. Mouse, eat fruits.

253
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:23,071
If you become fat eating sweets
you won't be able to run.

254
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,093
Come, I will show you
something interesting.

255
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,633
Friend Nandi, you are
very intelligent.

256
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:03,706
Answer this question.
- Yes, ask.

257
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:08,643
Look, if you can't answer
this question then..

258
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,654
..I will ride on your back.

259
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,589
There won't be any need for that.

260
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:17,049
Tell me, the mouse that's
sitting up there.

261
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,123
How much hair does he
have on his body?

262
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:35,076
I don't know, can you tell me.

263
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:36,475
Of course I can tell you.

264
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:39,681
He has 10,000 crore
hair on his body.

265
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,085
How? - If you don't believe me,
then count it.

266
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,288
He is right.

267
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,788
Get down from Nandi's back,
Lord Ganesh.

268
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:25,521
Except for your father, he doesn't
let anyone else sit on his back.

269
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,791
Child Ganesh! Child Ganesh!

270
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:39,137
Narad has just given a lot of
sweets to Mother Parvati. - Really!

271
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:44,146
But Mother Parvati was saying
I will keep it hidden.

272
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:47,741
Otherwise Ganesh will finish it off.

273
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:50,347
Come on, let us look for it.

274
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:13,434
Hey, get up.

275
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:25,847
Lord.

276
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,789
Look up there, there are the sweets.

277
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:51,847
It is quite high.

278
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:59,616
I will climb on you and try.

279
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,287
Come!

280
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,441
A bit high.

281
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,593
Modak.

282
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,689
I didn't do anything mother.

283
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:13,962
The mouse king dropped the sweets.

284
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:15,893
He climbed up.

285
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:23,364
Just see, my hands
don't even reach there.

286
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,844
You trouble me.

287
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:32,509
At least I got two.

288
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:41,049
You mischievous.

289
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:44,585
What is this?

290
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:50,323
What can I do mother.
You know how fond of sweets I am.

291
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:54,600
Is it? Mischievous.

292
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:09,408
Lord Shankar's tambour
is being played.

293
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:13,406
Parvati's son is dancing.

294
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:16,748
Lord Shankar's tambour
is being played.

295
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:18,618
Parvati's son is dancing.

296
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:21,624
Everyone is shouting hail
Ganesh on the icy Kailash.

297
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:22,817
Hail!

298
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:24,685
Hail!

299
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,964
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail! Hail!

300
00:46:29,834 --> 00:46:31,495
Lord Shankar's tambour
is being played.

301
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,161
Parvati's son is dancing.

302
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:36,770
Everyone is shouting hail
Ganesh on the icy Kailash.

303
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,441
Dancing.

304
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:42,445
Dancing.

305
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:46,449
Dancing.

306
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:10,200
Affectionate, loving, naughty.

307
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,465
Runs quickly along with the mice.

308
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:17,680
Affectionate, loving, naughty.

309
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:19,613
Runs quickly along with the mice.

310
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:21,480
Destroyer of peace,
solver of problems.

311
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:23,486
Curved trunk and black kohl eyes.

312
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:25,146
Curved trunk and black kohl eyes.

313
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:26,951
Curved trunk and black kohl eyes.

314
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:28,753
Child Ganesh dances and sways.

315
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,690
The devotees are rid
of their problems.

316
00:47:30,828 --> 00:47:32,489
Child Ganesh dances and sways.

317
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:34,497
The devotees are rid
of their problems.

318
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:52,581
Dancing.

319
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,515
Dancing.

320
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:58,516
Dancing.

321
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:20,536
Hearing all the commotion,
Parvati came to that part.

322
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:28,015
Seeing Mother Uma, all
the mice ran with fear.

323
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:35,548
But immersed in his fun, Lord
Ganesh is still dancing.

324
00:48:57,581 --> 00:49:00,914
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Hail Lord Ganesha!

325
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:04,576
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Hail Lord Ganesha!

326
00:49:04,722 --> 00:49:08,123
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Hail Lord Ganesha!

327
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:11,584
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Hail Lord Ganesha!

328
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:13,329
Hail Lord Ganesha!

329
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:22,596
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

330
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:32,605
Ganesh! Son Ganesh, don't
create a commotion.

331
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:36,015
Your father is meditating.

332
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,212
It will disrupt his meditation.

333
00:49:38,756 --> 00:49:39,814
As you wish mother.

334
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:45,622
And don't touch his things,
he gets very angry.

335
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:05,373
Alakh Niranjan!

336
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,708
Alakh Niranjan!

337
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:11,118
Greetings sage.
- Bless you.

338
00:50:11,855 --> 00:50:15,313
I have come to see your father,
Lord Bholenath.

339
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:21,063
Excuse me Sage, but he is immersed
in meditation, you cannot see him.

340
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:24,657
I have come from far for
a very important matter!

341
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,669
It is very important
for me to see him.

342
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:31,663
If anyone disrupts his meditation,
he gets very angry.

343
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,276
Come some other time.

344
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,742
You are insulting the guest, child!

345
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:39,339
I will surely see Bholenath!

346
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:42,150
That's impossible sage.

347
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:46,288
Innocent child, you are not familiar
with Parsuram's anger.

348
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,681
I am not afraid of threats, sage!

349
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:51,158
It will be best that you leave.

350
00:50:51,362 --> 00:50:52,420
Terrible insult!

351
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:57,297
Even the Gods didn't have
the courage to obstruct my path!

352
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:00,898
I have the courage
to face your arrogance.

353
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:04,832
Don't come forward.

354
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:43,141
You are very courageous,
aren't you child.

355
00:51:43,814 --> 00:51:45,805
Now bear my strike!

356
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:03,028
'Seeing Lord Shiva's axe, Lord
Ganesh took its blow on his teeth.'

357
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:10,763
Mother! Mother! Mother!

358
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:20,107
Ganesh!

359
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,978
Parsuram!

360
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:26,454
Forgive me Bholenath! Forgive me!

361
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,384
I have made a very big mistake
in a fit of rage.

362
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:31,385
So much anger.

363
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:35,522
You are ascetics, is that
why you ask for a boon!

364
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,062
So that you can strike
an innocent child!

365
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:41,134
Mother Parvati, please forgive me.

366
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:43,806
Surely, knowingly I have
made this mistake.

367
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:45,472
Forgive me Mother, forgive me!

368
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:48,807
By your asking for forgiveness,

369
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,177
..my son's tooth will
not be attached back.

370
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:53,812
It won't be attached Mother,

371
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:56,819
..but this broken tooth
will not go waste too.

372
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:01,018
'Since then Lord Ganesh was called
'Ekdanth' (One toothed) too.'

373
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:12,825
The stories of Lord Ganesh's
intelligence, cunningness..

374
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:16,839
..and courage are filled in
the religious scriptures.

375
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:21,367
And one of those is the
River Kaveri battle.

376
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,980
It will be really
enjoyable to watch.

377
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:30,842
'Once a demon called Surpdaman
pleased Lord Shankar..

378
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:35,517
..with his hard penance.'

379
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,897
I am pleased with your
penance, Surpdaman.

380
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:22,903
Ask, what boon you want.

381
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:25,898
Hail Bholenath!

382
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,978
I am so grateful that
you came to me.

383
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,905
Bestow me with a boon, that
I become invincible..

384
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:35,918
..no should be able to defeat me!

385
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:39,580
So be it.

386
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:41,991
I have become invincible!

387
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:44,521
Now no one can defeat me!

388
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:48,522
Now the Gods won't be
able to escape me.

389
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:10,343
'With Lord Shiva's boon, there
was chaos in Gods' abode.'

390
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:15,215
'Surpdaman started defeating the
Gods and taking them captive.'

391
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:24,292
'Lord Indra barely managed to
save his life and escape.'

392
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:07,474
Demon king, all the Gods
have been taken captive.

393
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,141
Only Lord Indra managed to escape.

394
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:14,006
And he has hidden in the
mountains in South India.

395
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:28,288
Catch him and take him captive too!

396
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:33,628
I am going to the Kailash mountains
to meet my deity, Lord Shankar.

397
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:48,115
Where are you running
off to Rain God?

398
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:52,783
If you know what's good
for you, then stop.

399
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,783
I will not make you a prisoner.

400
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:01,255
Really.

401
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:06,057
If you don't want to become a
prisoner like the other Gods..

402
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:09,264
..then do one thing for me.

403
00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:12,074
What is it?

404
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:17,278
Fearing my wrath Indra has fled and
hidden somewhere in South India.

405
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:23,818
By hiding him, the South
Indians have betrayed me.

406
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,082
They will be punished for that!

407
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,150
Stop taking clouds to South India!

408
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:34,089
They shouldn't get a drop of water!

409
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:36,098
When they will suffer
because of drought..

410
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,691
..they will handover Indra to me.

411
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:44,097
Do as I have asked you to,
or else you too..

412
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:56,117
'I am helpless.'

413
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:59,645
'I will have to obey this
cruel man's orders.'

414
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:36,819
'Because of Rain God's wrath, there
was a drought in South India.'

415
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:45,292
'Seeing the pitiful condition there,
Sage Agustya was deeply moved.'

416
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:49,763
'And he sat in veneration
to please Lord Brahma.'

417
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:31,271
Who is calling out to me?

418
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:03,837
Your veneration has been
successful, sage.

419
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:09,513
Tell me, what do you want?

420
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:12,447
Greetings Lord Brahma.

421
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:17,790
Lord, can you see the condition
of this state.

422
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,262
There is not even a drop of water.

423
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:24,794
Humans, animals, trees, plants,
birds everything is dying.

424
01:00:28,271 --> 01:00:32,264
Quickly go to Lord Shankar
on Kailash mountains..

425
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:37,006
..the Ganga flows from his hair,
only he can help you.

426
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:41,279
As you wish Lord.

427
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:45,073
Hey rat king, you've got moustache.

428
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:07,903
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

429
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,771
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

430
01:02:12,108 --> 01:02:15,509
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

431
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:19,639
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

432
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:35,463
I will catch a cold, what
are you doing Lord.

433
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:40,392
That's sage Agustya.

434
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,085
Yes, he is a very knowledgeable
ascetic.

435
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:01,481
Shut up!

436
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,758
Lord, I shall leave now.

437
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:19,834
Now sage will go to
South India with this water.

438
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,443
Why don't we go along too?

439
01:03:23,446 --> 01:03:26,176
I haven't seen the state
of South India.

440
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:31,045
Ask him, will he take us along?

441
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:34,915
If we ask, he will never
take us along.

442
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:38,460
We will quietly go behind with him.

443
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:42,522
So far, I will be tired Lord.

444
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,196
Lazy. Come on,
we will be very pleased.

445
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,168
Come.

446
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:30,170
Hide yourself.

447
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:40,247
Come.

448
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,593
The animals and
birds are dying of thirst..

449
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:04,868
..and sage has sat down to rest.

450
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:08,668
I am tired of walking.

451
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:11,011
Sage is tired too.

452
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:14,879
If he falls asleep, then who knows
how much time will be wasted.

453
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:18,951
Yes, but what can we do?

454
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:26,622
I have thought of an idea. Just
sit here and watch the fun.

455
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:42,769
Lord.

456
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:45,305
Quiet.

457
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:57,390
No!

458
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:01,129
You fool, what have you done?

459
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,791
You have ruined all my hard work.

460
01:07:04,267 --> 01:07:09,136
Black mouthed demon, I curse you!

461
01:07:16,946 --> 01:07:18,345
Lord Ganesh, you.

462
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:21,673
Please forgive me sage,
time was getting wasted..

463
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:25,209
..that's why I eased your work.

464
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,349
Look.

465
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:53,444
You are great Lord, I
couldn't recognise you.

466
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,315
I apologise to you.

467
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,711
No sage, you have done
a very big deed..

468
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:02,053
..for the welfare
of the earthlings.

469
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:06,728
For ages, the water of the Kaveri
river will flow like this..

470
01:08:06,796 --> 01:08:10,061
..and it's water will give
life to the creatures.

471
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:19,740
Listen friends.

472
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:23,871
There is good news.

473
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:26,009
My younger brother has come.

474
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,943
Congratulations.

475
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:30,485
Is that why you are
distributing sweets?

476
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:34,282
I am not distributing
it, I am eating it.

477
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:37,157
If you want, then
ask Mother Parvati.

478
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,159
Bring some for me too.

479
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,168
He will eat all the sweets alone.

480
01:08:56,446 --> 01:09:02,180
Lord Ganesh used to love his
younger brother Kartike a lot.

481
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:08,984
But there is always a sweet
argument between 2 brothers.

482
01:09:13,396 --> 01:09:17,924
'Lord Ganesh had the habit of
reading books and scriptures.'

483
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:20,268
'And he always used
to keep reading.'

484
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:24,534
But Kartika was
a courageous fighter.

485
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:40,940
Sweets!

486
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:01,494
They are delicious.

487
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:38,668
Come brother, let us go and
take a bath at the waterfalls.

488
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:45,942
Carry on, Kartike, today I have
eaten a lot. I am feeling sleepy.

489
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:50,008
By eating a lot, you have
become very lazy, brother.

490
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,947
That's nonsense, I am much more
energetic and active than you.

491
01:11:55,358 --> 01:12:00,352
Let it be brother, you won't even
be able to run along with me.

492
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:05,365
You don't know my strength Kartike.

493
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:08,236
Narayan Narayan.

494
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:13,965
Who is more stronger
amongst both of you..

495
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:16,978
..only a competition
can decide that.

496
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:19,037
What kind of competition, sage.

497
01:12:19,448 --> 01:12:22,975
Both of you take three rounds
of the world and come back..

498
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:26,988
..the one who returns first and
touches his parents feet first..

499
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:32,119
..will be declared the winner.

500
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:34,996
Narayan Narayan.

501
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,399
Three rounds of the world.

502
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:44,334
I am falling unconscious, Lord.

503
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,415
I accept it.
- I accept it too.

504
01:13:31,053 --> 01:13:32,111
Come, Come on?

505
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:51,665
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

506
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:55,475
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

507
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:59,479
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

508
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:03,540
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

509
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,817
There, I have completed three
rounds of the world.

510
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:11,685
How? You didn't even
leave from here.

511
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:13,823
You know everything, sage.

512
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:18,223
The entire world is immersed
in my mother and father.

513
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:21,092
As I completed three
rounds around them..

514
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,762
..that means I have taken
three rounds of the world.

515
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:41,249
Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord
Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh!

516
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:47,785
Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord
Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh!

517
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:52,129
Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord
Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh!

518
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:57,662
Hail Lord Ganesh! Hail Lord
Ganesh! Hail Lord Ganesh!

519
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:02,872
Brother, you didn't go.

520
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,679
You have really become lazy.

521
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:10,549
He has completed the three rounds
of the world before you.

522
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:14,347
And he has been declared
the winner too.

523
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,890
Narayan Narayan.

524
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:21,152
No, brother must have surely
used some cunningness.

525
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,893
Not cunningness, intelligence.

526
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:27,767
Narayan Narayan.

527
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:32,163
Brother, if you really
went round the world..

528
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:35,369
..then tell me what did you see?

529
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:40,177
The 7 big islands, 4 great seas,
the highest peak of Kailash..

530
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:45,186
..and the longest river
in the world, Nile.

531
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:46,312
Shall I tell you some more?

532
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:48,583
Enough, you are the winner.

533
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:52,183
But how is that possible?

534
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:54,787
Because of a small idea.

535
01:15:55,264 --> 01:16:02,602
But, today I am assured that my
younger brother is no less.

536
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:04,797
Really.

537
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,200
You are the true winner
of this competition.

538
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:33,827
Once, the moon God has a
tiff with Lord Ganesh.

539
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:35,767
It was very dark.

540
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:41,637
There was moonlight spread all over
the icy mountains if Kailash.

541
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:46,305
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

542
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,377
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

543
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:54,450
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

544
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:56,656
Naughty, naughty, juvenile..

545
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:36,696
Foolish mouse, why did you drop me.

546
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:41,292
What can I do, this snake
suddenly came in the way.

547
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:45,766
Forgive me Lord, forgive me!

548
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:47,707
I was in haste. Forgive me.

549
01:17:50,312 --> 01:17:51,711
You dropped all my sweets.

550
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:07,386
Okay?

551
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:13,324
Now you keep it safely.

552
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:23,742
How can you escape now?

553
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:44,757
God?

554
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:51,906
Carefully.

555
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,838
Stout Ganesha fell down
with the sweets.

556
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:08,387
You are laughing on me, Moon.

557
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,382
The radiance of your
face which you are..

558
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,395
..so arrogant about
will be destroyed.

559
01:19:15,397 --> 01:19:16,455
Lord!

560
01:19:16,532 --> 01:19:18,659
You won't be able to spread
your moonlight.

561
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:22,529
Whoever will look at you,
he will be tarnished too.

562
01:19:23,405 --> 01:19:24,463
No!

563
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:26,465
No!

564
01:19:32,414 --> 01:19:35,406
Forgive me Lord, I didn't say
anything with a bad intention..

565
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:38,419
..I was just having a bit fun.

566
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:42,417
Forgive me Lord, how can I
live with this black face.

567
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,488
You have a tender heart,
I have come in your shelter Lord.

568
01:19:49,765 --> 01:19:51,960
Please return me my luminance.

569
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:54,965
Forgive me Lord, forgive me.

570
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,501
Forgive me Lord, forgive me.

571
01:20:12,454 --> 01:20:15,184
Get up Moon. You are a God yourself.

572
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:20,591
It doesn't suit you to make fun
of other's physical weakness.

573
01:20:21,063 --> 01:20:22,997
You are right Lord Ganesh.

574
01:20:23,799 --> 01:20:27,929
I will never make such a mistake
again in future, please forgive me.

575
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,462
Yes Lord, if the moon doesn't
have moonlight..

576
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,941
..then the nights will not be fun.

577
01:20:37,813 --> 01:20:38,871
Forgive me, God?

578
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:45,213
Moon God, I cannot take back the
curse that I have given you.

579
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:49,489
But I bestow you with a boon, that
the radiance of your face..

580
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:54,222
..will slowly come and slowly go.

581
01:20:55,097 --> 01:20:58,225
People of the world will
continue to get your moonlit.

582
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,492
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

583
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:03,504
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

584
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:04,630
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

585
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:08,042
Thank you very much?

586
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,168
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

587
01:21:37,539 --> 01:21:41,999
This is my new bungalow,
and my new car.

588
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:56,081
When there is money in the pocket,
you like to show off.

589
01:21:57,092 --> 01:22:02,553
The God of wealth, Kuber did
something like that too.

590
01:22:02,898 --> 01:22:05,890
How, come let us see.

591
01:22:57,886 --> 01:22:59,877
Hail Mahadev!

592
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:08,762
Greetings to God Mahadev!

593
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:16,034
Greetings to Mother Parvati
and child Ganesh too.

594
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,167
Lord, I have come to you
with an invitation.

595
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:27,973
Which Invitation!

596
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:34,178
I have a request, all of you come
to my palace and have food.

597
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:48,659
'Under the pretext of the invitation,
he has come to show off..

598
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:50,864
..his wealth and valour.'

599
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:55,134
Please accept my request, Lord.

600
01:24:01,216 --> 01:24:03,684
Please excuse me Kuber, but
it is impossible for me..

601
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,687
..to leave Kailash and come.

602
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:13,691
And it is not possible for me
to come without my husband.

603
01:24:16,698 --> 01:24:20,361
So, will I have to return
disappointed from the Lords abode?

604
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,706
No king, you have come with such
respect with the invitation..

605
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:28,971
..then I accept your invitation.

606
01:24:32,314 --> 01:24:34,043
You can take child Ganesh along.

607
01:24:41,323 --> 01:24:43,723
He likes tasty food a lot.

608
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:54,129
As you wish Lord, come Lord Ganesh.

609
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:57,129
Father, I shall leave now.

610
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,224
Come Mouse?

611
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:38,433
Come in, Ganesh.

612
01:27:32,494 --> 01:27:33,552
Come in, Ganesh.

613
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,503
It was very tasty.

614
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:03,442
Hurry up?

615
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:22,658
Bring more food.

616
01:30:23,064 --> 01:30:24,258
Where shall I bring more from?

617
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:27,591
You have eaten the
entire city's food.

618
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:32,197
I don't know that, I am your guest.

619
01:30:32,674 --> 01:30:35,142
It is your duty to
appease my hunger.

620
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:38,477
Bring more food or else
I will eat you.

621
01:30:46,087 --> 01:30:47,679
He ran away, what else
should I eat now?

622
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:51,152
Help me Lord, help me!

623
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:56,620
I have come in your
shelter, save me!

624
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,156
What happened, king Kuber?

625
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,167
Why are you so scared?

626
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:02,831
Lord, what's hidden from you?

627
01:31:03,438 --> 01:31:06,703
Your son Ganesh's appetite doesn't
seem to get appeased at all.

628
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:09,500
He is threatening to eat me.

629
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,579
You are rich and powerful.

630
01:31:13,248 --> 01:31:15,716
You couldn't even appease the
hunger of a small child.

631
01:31:16,117 --> 01:31:20,713
Please forgive me Lord, in my
pride I had come to invite you.

632
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:23,716
But Lord Ganesh has
shattered my pride.

633
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:30,192
Good, at least you realised
your mistake.

634
01:31:30,732 --> 01:31:35,328
A wealthy and rich person should
be like a fruit bearing tree.

635
01:31:35,403 --> 01:31:36,802
That is always bent.

636
01:31:54,289 --> 01:31:55,347
Wow!

637
01:31:57,759 --> 01:31:58,817
Wow!

638
01:32:09,771 --> 01:32:11,170
No holding back, lets hear it

01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,174
Hail.

640
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:18,167

Hail.

642
01:32:20,181 --> 01:32:23,912
No holding back, lets hear it

643
01:32:24,185 --> 01:32:25,652
Hail.

644
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:27,586

01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:29,585
Hail.

646
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:05,350
Hail Lord Ganesh!

647
01:33:05,426 --> 01:33:07,621
Lord, I have brought a bowl of rice.

648
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:09,491
Please have this too.

649
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:12,766
What good will this rice do
to me, but bring it anyway.

650
01:33:25,246 --> 01:33:26,304
Wow!

651
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:30,507
It was very delicious rice,
my stomach is full.

652
01:33:34,255 --> 01:33:35,313
You are great, Lord.

653
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:38,990
Maybe I couldn't treat
the guests well.

654
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,318
Please forgive me.

655
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:44,320
No matter, invite me some other day.

656
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:46,998
No! Forgive me Lord, forgive me!

657
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:52,328
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

658
01:33:52,674 --> 01:33:56,007
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

659
01:33:56,878 --> 01:34:00,336
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

660
01:34:00,815 --> 01:34:04,273
Naughty, naughty, juvenile
child Ganesh.

661
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:11,349
Lord!

662
01:34:11,693 --> 01:34:17,290
Tarkasur has attacked Kailash
mountains to defeat Kartike.

663
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:21,498
Lord Shankar is not there too.

664
01:34:21,903 --> 01:34:23,029
What should we do?

665
01:34:23,838 --> 01:34:29,902
Don't worry, Tarkasur will be
killed by my dear brother's hands.

666
01:34:32,313 --> 01:34:36,443
I will stay in Kailash during the
war and associate my brother.

667
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:37,976
Come brother.

668
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:43,382
Time has come to free the world
from the atrocities of Tarkasur.

669
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:46,584
As you wish brother.

670
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:51,321
Be assured, I will punish
this sinner right away..

671
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:55,335
..and free the earth
of his evil deeds!

672
01:35:53,728 --> 01:35:55,389
What's this?

673
01:35:55,997 --> 01:35:58,932
How can this small
child ever slay me!

674
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,528
I will crush him!

675
01:36:04,072 --> 01:36:07,473
One of my demon soldier
is enough for him.

676
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:15,613
Laugh arrogant fool, laugh
all you can before death.

677
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:20,151
Because after today, neither will
you survive nor your laughter.

678
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:22,889
How dare you deceptive child!

679
01:36:23,491 --> 01:36:27,825
I will teach you and your handful
of devotees a lesson right away!

680
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:29,555
Attack!

681
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:49,628

Hail.

691
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:38,387
There are many more stories
related to child Ganesh.

692
01:43:38,926 --> 01:43:40,917
But all that, some other time.

693
01:44:12,226 --> 01:44:15,627
Has the strength of an elephant,
face, and intelligence.

694
01:44:16,096 --> 01:44:19,293
Every deed begins with him.

695
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:23,301
Out sweet is adorable to everyone.

696
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:28,103
The children know

01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:36,105
Then call out from the heart, come
on everyone sound the drums.
