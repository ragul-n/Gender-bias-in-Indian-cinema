1
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,680
<i>Oh, it was the silly little apple</i>
<i>That brought us all our woes,</i>

2
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:37,604
<i>One bite that stole our right</i>
<i>To live there with friends & foes!</i>

3
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:42,062
<i>We had to leave, we Adam & Eve,</i>
<i>And there we lost the Land,</i>

4
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:46,604
<i>Her labor pains made a million Cains.</i>
<i>And the Garden?</i>

5
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:49,604
The Garden got stone and sand!

6
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,187
They made the poor snake
into the villain, huh?

7
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,104
Your new clothes have arrived.

8
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,729
What else had you written on your list?

9
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:03,854
Toffee!

10
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:07,354
Papa has brought that too.

11
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,354
Everything is going to go well dear.

12
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,229
Don't stress your father too much.

13
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,104
Ask me for whatever you need, all right?

14
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,729
Go! Knock on his door!

15
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:31,479
How much longer will you bath for, Papa?

16
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,312
How much longer will you bath for, Papa?
We can't be late today!

17
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:43,937
<i>♫All those who recite this prayer to Hanuman,</i>
<i>are sure to be blessed  ♫</i>

18
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:47,687
<i>♫As is the claim of Gods, themselves♫</i>

19
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,437
Say now, all hail to the Lord!

20
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,229
Come, come!
It's Mr. Chintu's birthday today!

21
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:01,479
Toffee!

22
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:04,854
Share it with all your friends!

23
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:12,729
And listen,
don't stress your mother too much, ok?

24
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:16,687
I'm here, right? We'll have a
spectacular birthday celebration!

25
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,104
How many toffees should I distribute?

26
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,354
How many?

27
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:24,687
Just enough so
I can have some in the evening too?

28
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,812
Two each will do love.

29
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:30,562
And if there are any leftover,
then we'll put them in the balloon at night!

30
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:34,354
And when we burst the balloon,
it will rain toffees!

31
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:34,937
And cake?

32
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:38,812
Cake?
Shall I use my Third Eye to see?

33
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:48,854
Oh, I can see the cake!

34
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,979
And such a pretty cake it is!

35
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,687
And so delicious!

36
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:59,562
It is just waiting for
your sister to come collect it!

37
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:00,979
What’s this?

38
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:03,937
Waheed’s gift.

39
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:06,562
This is a gift?

40
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:13,979
This Waheed just loiters around on the streets.

41
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,104
I have seen him often, in those alleys by the bank.

42
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:24,354
This is the same kid who gave you
Saddam's hand as a gift right?

43
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,312
He is a big troublemaker...

44
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:28,979
Let's drop it...

45
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:29,979
Drop it?

46
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,937
He is coming in the evening right?

47
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:36,604
I'll talk to him.

48
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,854
What if someone saw us
with something like this?

49
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,479
How many friends have you invited?

50
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:47,979
Twenty-five.

51
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,479
Twenty-five!

52
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,604
<i>Chintu</i>

53
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,104
Did you take Grandma's blessing birthday boy?

54
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,854
Go, go!
Don't keep her waiting.

55
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:00,354
You must have told him
to invite an whole army!

56
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:06,187
Of course. I told him to invite fifty!
We need to make up for last year too!

57
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:11,854
Chintu! Come, come, come.

58
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:17,604
What mischief have you been up to all day?

59
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:19,979
And only now you remember
to ask for your Grandma's blessings?

60
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,687
Actually, Papa reminded me.

61
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,604
Go, look what your sister has left for you!

62
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,729
She's been planning a lot.
Bring it here! I have to tell you about it!

63
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,479
Grandma! I'm not supposed to know.
That way the surprise will be more fun!

64
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,354
I know! This is part of the fun.

65
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:44,854
Let's see what she has written to you...

66
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:50,187
Do not stress Mama and Papa about the cake.

67
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,104
I will bring it on my way back from school.

68
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,979
Do not keep opening the fridge to look for it.

69
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,437
Do not touch it before it's time to cut it.

70
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:04,229
And do not greedily open the gifts before it's time!

71
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:05,937
Or you will be in for a beating!

72
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,604
Nevermind. Let's put this useless note aside.

73
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:12,604
She is pointlessly bullying my baby!
She doesn't know everything!

74
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:14,812
Let her get back, I'll scold her!

75
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:19,187
I think they're finally calling.

76
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:25,187
Oh, it's Chintu's friend...

77
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:26,604
<i>Hello!</i>

78
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:29,562
<i>No school today, Chintu!</i>

79
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,562
But my sister already went in the morning!

80
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,979
<i>Everyone has left long ago.</i>

81
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:40,604
What happened Chintu?

82
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:42,562
<i>Who was it? </i>

83
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:46,937
What happened? Tell us.

84
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,437
The school's closed today too.

85
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,104
But your sister went this morning!

86
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,812
They've all been sent back.

87
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:02,062
-I should go and check.
-Try calling first.

88
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,312
-I can't get through
-You can’t...

89
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,312
Let me try...

90
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:12,854
Here...

91
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,104
Nothing. It's not even ringing...

92
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,979
Try call brother Mahdi maybe?

93
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,729
<i>Papa has been promising this for over a month-</i>

94
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,854
<i>That I'll have a rocking birthday this time.</i>

95
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,687
<i>Sister planned a surprise for me,</i>

96
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:42,687
<i>Grandma made her yummy rice pudding,</i>

97
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,187
<i>Mom got me new clothes,</i>

98
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,104
<i>And yet again,</i>
<i>my birthday is going to be ruined...</i>

99
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:59,687
If only we were back home in India...

100
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,729
<i>When I was still a baby,</i>

101
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,312
<i>We lived in Bihar.</i>

102
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:15,104
<i>Papa was a water-filter salesman.</i>

103
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:19,229
<i>Girish Uncle was his boss,</i>

104
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:26,687
<i>He brought cheap filters from Nepal,</i>
<i>for papa to sell in India.</i>

105
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:35,187
<i>Then one day, Uncle learnt</i>
<i>about the water crisis in Iraq!</i>

106
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,604
<i>And he grew determined to help the people there!</i>

107
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:48,562
<i>'Cheap and Best',</i>
<i>make these words your chant.</i>

108
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,604
<i>And charm everyone with it!</i>

109
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:53,479
<i>Understood?</i>

110
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:00,312
<i>And so my Papa landed in...</i>

111
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:03,312
<i>Baghdad!</i>

112
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:14,104
<i>It was a different time back then.</i>

113
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:18,854
<i>Saddam Hussein reigned here.</i>

114
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:21,729
<i>He lived in a magnificent palace.</i>

115
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,937
<i>And if he didn't like something,</i>
<i>It would just get banned.</i>

116
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,229
<i>For everyone!</i>

117
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:36,354
<i>But even the all-powerful Saddam</i>
<i>couldn't do what my Papa did.</i>

118
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:39,354
<i>To get everyone clean water.</i>

119
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,229
<i>And his legend spread far and wide.</i>

120
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,229
<i>Well done Madan!</i>

121
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,437
<i>When shall I send your family along?</i>

122
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:55,479
<i>Brother, would you mind sending</i>
<i>my mother-in-law along too?</i>

123
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:57,937
<i>She could help take care of the kids.</i>

124
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,229
<i>And so we came to Iraq.</i>

125
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,604
<i>Nani was Papa's biggest fan after that.</i>

126
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:14,104
<i>All because he got her, her first plane ride!</i>

127
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:19,104
<i>But there was one person,</i>
<i>who could not stand our happiness.</i>

128
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,312
<i>Our Great American Uncle.</i>

129
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:28,104
<i>A few days before my birthday,</i>
<i>he gave his soldiers marching orders.</i>

130
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,729
<i>And so, my birthday was...</i>

131
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:48,354
<i>Cancelled...</i>

132
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:52,104
<i>Papa rushed to the embassy.</i>

133
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,479
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>A Nepalese passport?</i>

134
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:04,854
<i>Pretend to be Indian all you want,</i>
<i>your passport says you're Nepalese.</i>

135
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:09,979
<i>Brother, any way you can help us return?</i>

136
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:21,729
<i>Amazing! They made you Nepalese</i>
<i>and you didn't even realise!</i>

137
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:26,479
<i>How was it Papa's fault?</i>
<i>It was our American Uncle's doing after all...</i>

138
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,229
<i>He enjoyed it so much,</i>

139
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,937
<i>That he decided to leave his army behind.</i>

140
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:45,979
<i>Since then, they too have been stuck here.</i>

141
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,729
<i>Like us, the forgotten.</i>

142
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:07,937
I’m sure it’s there.
My wife’s favorite piece of junk!

143
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:14,854
Please leave out the gory details
in front of Chintu.

144
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:15,979
-Understood?
-Understood.

145
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:26,562
On time for Chintu birthday!!

146
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,312
Salam waleikum brother Mahdi!

147
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:31,479
Waleikum salam!

148
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,479
I near the school when it bombing.

149
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:35,937
Air-blane.

150
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:38,937
Thank you, brother Mahdi

151
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,354
How are you brother?

152
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:42,604
Very bad outside?

153
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:46,479
Very bad. Saddam, little snake.
This America, big snake!

154
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:48,979
Did you get the cake Lakshmi dear?

155
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,062
Cake?

156
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,104
No cake in Baghdad today.

157
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,604
Not so loud, Mahdi uncle please!

158
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,354
The stores are closed...

159
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,104
God bless his soul!

160
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,729
Baker dead. Bakery damage.

161
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:05,604
Children enter, eat all cake,
over dead body baker.

162
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:06,604
Our bakery?

163
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,104
What did I just tell you?

164
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,660
No no, tell me what happened-

165
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,229
The star of the day!
The apple of our eyes!!

166
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,220
Happy Birthday dear!

167
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,850
-Did you get the cake Lakshmi?
-Namaste Grandma dearest!

168
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,729
-Let's see the cake!
-The cake isn't here yet Ma.

169
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,062
The one they made was terrible, right?

170
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:32,479
Yes, but Uncle Mahdi and I have a Plan B.

171
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,479
But Papa's Third Eye had shown
that the cake is really good?

172
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:41,479
Ah! My Third Eye is
failing me nowadays!

173
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:44,062
What is this Plan B you have?

174
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:47,354
Tell them, tell them our
grand plan!

175
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:50,312
Mummy, Uncle told me that
there is an old oven lying in the store room?

176
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,540
So why don’t we bake Chintu’s cake at home?

177
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,100
Of course, after all we know Chintu's taste best!

178
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,850
Your friends will gobble it up!

179
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:06,187
And watch, I will put up
beautiful decorations myself!

180
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:12,979
You shouldn't make empty promises.
Man should think before he speaks.

181
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:18,062
Chintu, nobody will stop this party.

182
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes! Think positive and anything can happen.

183
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:26,479
-When'll the cake be ready by?
-Before your friends get here!

184
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:29,354
Come, smile for me.
It's going to be fine.

185
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:38,479
<i>Why my neighbor,</i>
<i>Why don't you visit me?</i>

186
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,479
<i>Are you angry at me?</i>
<i>And is that why you don't visit me?</i>

187
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,229
-Say "Thank you".
-Thank you!

188
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:52,479
Are you angry at me?
And that's why you don't visit me?

189
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,220
Torch!

190
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,104
Little loose here…

191
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:04,604
Yours only!

192
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,850
OK! Go.

193
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,100
-I go?
-Go, go.

194
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,104
There.... There...

195
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,430
Near wall...

196
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:32,187
Near the wall are her things!

197
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,810
Where is oven?

198
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,880
Colour bink, carton big... Yes?

199
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,930
You see?

200
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:47,312
I can't find it, brother Mahdi!

201
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,930
Oh God!
I should have gone inside.

202
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:54,937
OK. OK... I come... I come...

203
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,229
There rats brother?

204
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:04,479
I found it! I found it!

205
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,229
My baby is all grown up...

206
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:17,354
It's Chintu's birthday, he is the
one who has grown older.

207
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,479
We found it ladies! We found it!

208
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,812
Hold on! Clean it first!

209
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,604
Yeah, bring me a rag or something.

210
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:26,562
You don't have to do everything.

211
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:27,937
Yes, let me do it!

212
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:30,604
Hold on, let's move it here...

213
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:33,479
Very old!

214
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,187
Red light... must red.

215
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,604
It's not turning on.

216
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,812
But she always baked cakes in it. Delicious.

217
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:03,104
When Lord Hanuman
went looking for the magical plant,

218
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:06,312
He didn't have a map, did he?

219
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:09,854
But he found a way, right?

220
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:12,854
He was the saviour, you are not!

221
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:16,937
Grandma dearest, don't worry,
Madan make oven good.

222
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:19,229
These are our saviours!

223
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:31,937
Hey, listen...

224
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:39,104
Don't worry. If your papa can't fix the oven,
I'll make you delicious Halwa.

225
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:39,937
Indian cake!

226
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:44,104
You don't have Halwa on your birthday,
you have cake. And Papa will fix the oven!

227
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:49,354
Chintu, get out!
I need to work here.

228
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,479
Let me have my way today at least.

229
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,604
-Out!
-What do you have to do today?

230
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:58,479
Why kick him out?
Let him also see what you're doing!

231
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:01,687
If I let him see, it won't be a surprise anymore.

232
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:05,229
What's the need for a surprise!

233
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:11,104
Two weeks of work, and you want
me to show it just like that?

234
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:13,479
Do you ever feed anyone a half-cooked meal?

235
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,854
How do you make something so beautiful?

236
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,354
Do you want to learn?
Papa’s birthday is around the corner.

237
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:35,187
I think...we're done!

238
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,854
It should work now.

239
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,104
It's all thanks to this screwdriver!

240
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:53,229
My wife bought it after all.
Everything works if she is around.

241
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,437
Hail Lord Hanuman!

242
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,854
It works! Let's get the batter!

243
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:15,729
Mom may say what she wants,
but you are the real saviour!!!

244
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,604
It was nothing.
Just disassembled it and put it back.

245
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:28,604
Another raisin for luck...

246
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,354
And now Lakshmi will bake the cake!

247
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:36,687
What happened?

248
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,350
Well? Do you approve Madam?

249
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,540
I just hope the power doesn't go out.

250
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,380
It definitely won't, don't you fret!

251
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,020
Relax! Smile a little-

252
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
We gonna have cake! Yum Yum Cake!

253
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,060
<i>Love comes from God,</i>
<i>not through me,</i>

254
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,040
<i>The trick is not in my hand.</i>

255
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,260
<i>Love comes from God,</i>
<i>not through me,</i>

256
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,480
<i>The trick is not in my hand.</i>

257
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,040
We sing this song in prison, for enjoy.

258
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,470
But you are not playing it!
We sing this song in prison, for enjoy.

259
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,500
But you are not playing it!

260
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,200
Where did you get this Oud?

261
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,660
Omar gave it to me.
Before they left for Syria.

262
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,980
Omar’s father was my colleague.

263
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,820
We survived torture together.

264
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,900
In the prison, they poisoned our food.

265
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,880
Released snakes in the cells.

266
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,600
And rats!

267
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,780
Hell be to Saddam Hussein!!!

268
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,880
I still get nightmares of rats
chewing me up.

269
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,320
Was there no way to escape?

270
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,100
How do you think I get out?

271
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,860
No one can pin me down.

272
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,840
Neither that bastard Saddam,
nor these crazy American dogs!

273
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,850
<i>Above the palm trees,</i>
<i>I've got a friend up there</i>

274
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,860
Why pose with it when you can’t play?

275
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,220
Because I look good holding this.

276
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,900
Like Elvis Bresley!

277
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,400
<i>Above the palm trees,</i>
<i>I've got a friend up there,</i>

278
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:32,460
<i>is it the shine coming from her cheeks,</i>
<i>Or is it the moon shining from above?</i>

279
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,320
Looks like we'll have the good fortune
of seeing you in a saree today.

280
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,810
Are you tired?

281
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,400
Too much work, is it?

282
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,700
Don't worry, I'll not do anything
when it's your birthday!

283
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,100
Can't believe he turns six today!

284
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,540
And Lakshmi, she acts older than me...

285
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,350
You know what I think?

286
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,200
It’s time for a 'Mintu'.

287
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,540
It is time...for a small...'Mintu'

288
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,820
Listen..
It is time...for a small...'Mintu'

289
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,000
Listen..

290
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,400
You don't like the name?

291
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,080
How about 'Pintu'?

292
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,140
Take us home first.

293
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,980
That's bound to happen.

294
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,900
We will get the call today.

295
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,920
But first give me a confirmation...

296
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Mintu? Pintu?

297
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,020
<i>Mummy!</i>

298
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,800
Just a second.

299
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,460
We're discussing something
urgent over here!

300
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,420
Hardly urgent...

301
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,860
If you leave me hanging,
I'll have to bring it up in front of everyone!

302
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,470
We’ll see!

303
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,680
What do you think?

304
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,680
Can you please ask mom?

305
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,900
There will be another place...

306
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,760
At least ask him...

307
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,220
After all these years
you are still so formal with me.

308
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,760
I don’t want the decor to be changed.
But that doesn’t mean there can be no exceptions!

309
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,430
Thanks brother Mahdi.

310
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,860
Until my wife return,
this house is your house, dear sister!

311
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
House head always woman.

312
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,920
We give the world to men

313
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,540
and see what they do!

314
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,520
Chintu! Stop gaping
and get me some tape.

315
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
Go go go! I don't have all day.

316
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,600
Attention! Attention!

317
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,600
We bring good news!

318
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,360
On this special occasion,

319
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Chintu's mom, Sudha,
is going to sing us a special song!

320
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,460
What’s this now?

321
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,820
Did you know Mr. Chintu?

322
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:20,720
When you were tiny, your Mom used to
sing quietly while bathing you.

323
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,340
No, no, that was Grandma!

324
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,120
She's sleeping, what if she wakes up?

325
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,080
Let her wake up!
A nightingale has nothing on her.

326
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Mummy, today you can't say no!

327
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,580
Exactly!

328
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,620
High five!

329
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,360
The stage is ready.

330
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,040
And we are waiting.

331
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,780
Cultural program from India!

332
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,120
Chintu!

333
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:54,900
Pintu!

334
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:15,800
<i>O little Koel, my dear bird,</i>

335
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,100
<i>Please drop a couple of berries,</i>

336
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:33,220
<i>O little Koel, my dear bird,</i>
<i>Please drop a couple of berries.</i>

337
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:43,180
<i>If they are unripe, I'll smack you,</i>
<i>Drop some ripe, black berries,</i>

338
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:52,312
<i>O little Koel, my dear bird,</i>
<i>Please drop a couple of berries.</i>

339
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:59,680
<i>My child and your child</i>
<i>Both look so adorable,</i>

340
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:06,680
<i>My child and your child</i>
<i>Both look so adorable,</i>

341
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:14,940
<i>Both have anklets in their feet,</i>
<i>So drop some ripe, black berries,</i>

342
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:25,420
<i>O little Koel, my dear bird,</i>
<i>Please drop a couple of berries.</i>

343
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,880
The Nightingale.

344
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:46,340
<i>The only difference,</i>
<i>Dear birdy, is the two fathers,</i>

345
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,960
<i>Your hubby's skin is black as coal,</i>
<i>While mine looks like white ash,</i>

00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:00,060
<i>Your husband has a melodious voice,</i>
<i>While mine is tone-deaf,</i>

347
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:07,000
<i>Your husband has a melodious voice,</i>
<i>While mine is tone-deaf,</i>

348
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:16,180
<i>But both still are sweethearts,</i>
<i>So drop some ripe, black berries,</i>

349
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,180
<i>O little Koel, my dear bird,</i>
<i>Please drop a couple of berries.</i>

350
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,180
Down, on the floor!

351
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,360
Lakshmi dear, shut those windows!

352
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,850
And stay with Grandma.

353
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,260
They won’t even let me have
your cake in peace!

354
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,680
Happy Birthday once again, my child!

355
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,880
May Allah bless you
with all that your kind heart has desired.

356
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,970
Where you go, brother Mahdi?

357
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,200
You OK?

358
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,900
Help me please!

359
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,900
Calm down!

360
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,810
What happened, brother Mahdi?

361
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,600
Grandma dearest. Help me please!

362
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,850
I’ll explain everything once they’re gone!!

363
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,350
Take this.

364
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,720
Tell me there are no rats in here!

365
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,470
Let me see.

366
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,350
Open up!

367
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,080
Who is there?

368
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,850
Welfare check!

369
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,930
That’s how you pull 'em out.

370
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,680
What took you so long, buddy?

371
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,100
Welcome!

372
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,720
You guys got a party going on in here?

373
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,280
Yes, actually, it's Chintu’s birthday, my son-

374
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,930
Could you please stand back a little bit?

375
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,100
Sorry!

376
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,060
Happy Birthday!

377
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,680
Make it a good one.

378
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,850
Say "Thank You".

379
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,850
Thank You!

380
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,680
Is everything fine, Sir?

381
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,560
The car bomb that went off a little bit ago?

382
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,220
You know anything about that?

383
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,220
Yes... no, no.

384
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,350
We got shocked also!

385
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,200
Very bad!

386
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
How's it looking?

387
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,930
It's kinda funny!

388
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,660
Let’s check their IDs.

389
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,300
That won’t be needed...

390
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,920
What’s your name?

391
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,060
My name is Madan Tiwari, Sir.

392
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,437
We are Indian.

393
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:45,979
Madan in Indian means 'God of Love'.

394
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:50,687
Kamdev? Like in Kamasutra?

395
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:56,729
My daughter, Lakshmi, 'Goddess of Wealth'.

396
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,600
My mother-in-law, Sarla Devi. Sweet,
innocent and very simple, also goddess.

397
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,437
Those are water filters, Sir.

398
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:19,354
I sell water filters.
“OK Pure” - cheap and best!

399
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:20,437
Want to see?

400
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:23,979
Bulb is fuse…
but you have light.

401
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:30,187
Till last year I had very good business.

402
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:33,312
But this year, not so good.

403
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:37,229
Weapons of Mass Destruction, finally!

404
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,060
Rats, Sir! There are many rats.

405
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,560
Keep multiplying everyday!

406
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,854
Rats! I fucking hate rats!

407
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:52,437
I'm just like you! I also hate rats!

408
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,479
I think they're harmless.

409
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:17,687
We might've shook 'em
up a little bit, but that's...

410
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:21,729
Hold on.

411
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:24,104
Is that what I think it is?

412
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:31,979
Yes.

413
00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:36,937
You do not remember?

414
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:40,437
He wouldn't know.
He was busy training troops in Georgia.

415
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:43,354
It's his first week in Iraq.

416
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:46,312
Oh! Welcome to Iraq, Sir!

417
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:52,937
America attack Iraq last year,
all Saddam statues got broken.

418
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,604
Chintu got this hand
as a birthday gift from his friend.

419
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,680
Chintu!

420
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,680
He was once a member of Saddam party!

421
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:05,104
No shit!

422
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,480
Saddam's Party!

423
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,540
So even the kids here
idolised Saddam Hussein?

424
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,430
No, no. Chintu idolises Lord Hanuman.

425
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,180
He failed in Arabic.

426
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,180
Saddam had a rule. All children who fail,
join party, you pass.

427
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,560
Very strange days!

428
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Days are still strange, man.

429
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,460
Strange days are here to stay.

430
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,560
But I am so proud of my son.

431
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,000
And my daughter, Lakshmi!

432
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,810
She's topper of the class.

433
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,280
Who the fuck do you've hiding in there?

434
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,800
I want all of you to turn around, now.

435
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,720
Facing the wall!

436
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,062
Now!

437
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,970
Who the fuck are you?

438
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,720
Stay the fuck down!

439
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,680
Double-check the room.

440
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,220
Don't fucking move!

441
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,680
Stay the fuck down!

442
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:57,062
Take him away.

443
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,360
We don't know him!

444
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,480
He's innocent.

445
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,100
Am I gonna find anything?

446
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,350
You have anything on you?

447
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,970
Is he part of your family?

448
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:11,312
- Stay quiet mom! Relax!
- What are you saying mom!

449
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:15,062
You have no idea
what's coming your way, you American dogs!

450
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:16,812
Sayyid has given his command.

451
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,810
Don't give me a reason!

452
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,680
Wait... I can explain...

453
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,260
On the fucking ground! Now!

454
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,420
It's a mistake! See, there's a mistake!

455
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
Say one more motherfucking word,
and I'll blow your goddamn head off!

456
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,350
You stay where you are.

457
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,680
Unbelievable!

458
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,430
There really is no such
thing as civilians in Iraq!!

459
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,310
Blaster Main, this is Fireball 1.

460
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:05,229
Requesting pick up of two detainees at the
Barbie house near big mosque. How copy? Over.

461
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,810
Copy, two detainees in custody. Over.

462
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,350
Copy that.

463
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,680
Route is clear.
Fireball 6 in route to location. Over.

464
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,680
Copy that. Over and out.
Let's Go.

465
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,350
Shut up!

466
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,470
Yeah, Jackson will be all right.
We'll be rolling out soon.

467
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,350
We're requesting a change
of location for pick-up.

468
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,680
This place is a fucking maze.

469
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,930
These locals are getting
a little froggy. Over.

470
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,680
Fireball 1, we are assessing
the situation now. Break.

471
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,180
That was a second vehicle
that went off.

472
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,930
We're going to find another way to get
to you and this may take a while. Over.

473
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,220
We also have two detainees,
how copy? Over.

474
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,850
Negative. You cannot get out
with the detainees.

475
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,437
Standby for alternate location.
Blaster Main, out.

476
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,310
We're fucking trapped!

477
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,660
Welcome to Bum-Fuck Iraq!

478
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Don't worry, Sir.

479
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,890
Stay here as long as you want.

480
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:41,729
Our house is very auspicious.

481
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:47,229
All neighborhood houses
get bombed, broken.

482
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:49,229
Never our house.

483
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,646
You wise-ass 'God of Sex'!

484
00:37:55,771 --> 00:38:00,271
What are you even doing here?
In this house? In this hell!

485
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:02,229
We'll go home soon, Sir!

486
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:06,229
My father is talking to a
minister in Delhi.

487
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,479
Today!

488
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,729
We are waiting for his call.

489
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:14,104
Listen. You might say
I'm a mean son of a bitch or somethin'...

490
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,479
Coz I look like one.

491
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:28,979
But I don't think you'll be
going home anytime soon.

492
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,146
You hear that?

493
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:41,271
This place is like a black hole, man.
Ain't nothing going up outta here!

494
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:44,229
What?

495
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,470
They said we can't move
out, not with these two.

496
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:53,979
And I'm not gonna just sit up in here
while the action is outside, man.

497
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:05,479
You thank your gods that it's
your kid's birthday.

498
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:12,146
I'm normally not Mr. Nice Guy.

499
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,470
You can't do that!

500
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,479
Listen sweety, I'm just doing this
so that both of us can get outta here!

501
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:20,396
<i>Your goodness saved you, brother.</i>

502
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:25,021
<i>But I'll need to think of something else,</i>

503
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:29,354
<i>To get rid of these bastards!</i>

504
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:34,396
Could you give me that chorus again
in English, please, Sir?

505
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:40,729
Your goodness saved you, brother.

506
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:41,729
But I'll.

507
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,850
Not singing now, are you?

508
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,390
Chintu!

509
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:05,396
Chintu!

510
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,100
Chintu!

511
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:09,604
Open it quickly, Chintu!

512
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,100
Fuck!

513
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:19,146
We come for Chintu Birthday Party!

514
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,470
Best friend! Girlfriend!

515
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,354
She go to school
you destroy this morning.

516
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:31,354
Very danger outside. I die outside.
Here I eat cake.

517
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:43,229
Hey, Louis! Wassup my nigga!

518
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,021
Salaam waleikum, American Boy!

519
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:50,854
But we gotta come up with
another name for me!

520
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:53,396
You come for birthday party?

521
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:55,146
Sort of!

522
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,896
I got something for you - What?

523
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:03,604
Here you go.

524
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:04,854
Three!

525
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,479
You don't tell him about me?

526
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,479
Waheed!

527
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,521
Chintu dear! Happy Birthday.

528
00:41:24,854 --> 00:41:26,604
Zainab, show him your gift!

529
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:28,646
Now you'll give us
my favourite candy.

530
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:29,979
You know this kid?

531
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:32,729
Who this kid?
Ask your Mommy if I a kid!

532
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:36,854
You remember that movie from the
other night? 'Bang Bang Busty Woman'?

533
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,271
Come on, man! You loved it.

534
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:40,396
Anyway, thank him for that.

535
00:41:41,146 --> 00:41:43,854
He's our little angel in this
motherfucking desert.

536
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:46,896
Fuck!

537
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:48,604
Where is he?

538
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:49,854
Where the fuck...

539
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:53,271
Bathroom!

540
00:41:58,979 --> 00:41:59,979
<i>What you got?</i>

541
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,354
Fuck!

542
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,729
He is gone.

543
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:05,271
<i>What?</i>

544
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:06,604
I said he is fucking gone.

545
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:08,604
Fuck!

546
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:10,146
I'm going to get him.

547
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:12,646
Fuck. Stay there.

548
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:15,271
Go, Go! Amreeka! Yalla, yalla!!

549
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:10,271
Fireball 1, the rest of Fireball has moved ahead
and is pushing them East of your locaition.

550
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:14,479
Be advised you are now
at the rear of the convoy. Break..

551
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:21,396
Sappers will be in route to you
when the route is clear. How, copy?

552
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,396
Lima Charlie, Blaster Main.

553
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:32,771
Jackson! This is Reed. How copy? Over.

554
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:39,604
Jackson! This is Reed. How copy? Over.

555
00:43:58,146 --> 00:43:59,896
Is he a bad man?

556
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:03,146
Doesn't matter. He is American.

557
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:10,979
Get me some cotton and antiseptic?
He's wounded.

558
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:15,354
What is he playing at?

559
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:22,271
You could have let him die! But no!
You want to be a saint!

560
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:24,354
Mom, maybe you should go rest...

561
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:32,354
What do you think is going to happen?
You'll smile and fires of hell will cool?

562
00:44:32,646 --> 00:44:35,979
Stop talking like you're
the only one suffering!

563
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:40,271
Fine! Go help the man
who wants to kill us all.

564
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:42,854
Do you even think before you speak?

565
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:46,104
Or do you just like to blame Dad
the moment something happens?

566
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:50,104
Is this how you speak to your elders?
Such insolence!

567
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,646
Mom! What do you want?

568
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,354
To go back home? To live peacefully?

569
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:58,854
You think we don't want that?
We don't want the safety of our home?

570
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:00,104
Let's drop it...

571
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:01,229
No, let me finish.

572
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,854
You are telling my daughter to behave?

573
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:09,104
Have you ever heard her talk
back to me? Or her Dad?

574
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:11,396
Or anyone else? Have you?

575
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:25,104
You shouldn't have spoken
to your Grandmother like that.

576
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:27,354
Haven't we discussed this?

577
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:29,521
She did nothing wrong.

578
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,521
The old lady needs a taste of her
own medicine from time to time.

579
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,229
Oh my God!

580
00:45:46,729 --> 00:45:48,354
Hey, it's OK... We can fix this!

581
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:50,646
How?

582
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:04,646
There must be something we can do?

583
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:15,354
Something that can hold six candles
and a knife can slice.

584
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:17,229
That's what a cake is after all...

585
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:31,979
Lakshmi, listen...

586
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:35,021
No matter what happens,

587
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:39,104
Chintu will celebrate his birthday!

588
00:46:39,729 --> 00:46:41,354
Right?

589
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,729
Here, this will help!

590
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:07,271
Who all in your family, Sir?

591
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:19,479
Your father must be really
proud of his soldier son.

592
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:21,479
No?

593
00:47:21,896 --> 00:47:22,979
Government job.

594
00:47:23,646 --> 00:47:25,021
Good security.

595
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,396
Who was the Haji you were hiding in there?

596
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:37,354
Sir, he is the landlord of this house,
Hassan Mahdi.

597
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:39,896
He's a very sweet man.

598
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:47,479
You know, he travelled from Najaf
just to come for Chintu's birthday.

599
00:47:50,104 --> 00:47:52,854
I don't think he knows anything
about the bomb-blast.

600
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,646
You don't think!

601
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:57,604
Then why did you let him hide in there?

602
00:47:57,604 --> 00:48:02,896
We don't know! After you knocked,
he behave like that for the first time.

603
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:04,229
Like a scared child.

604
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:05,479
Exactly!

605
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:08,646
Why do you think he was so afraid?

606
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:15,396
You're a damn fool if you think
you can trust these fucking locals, man!

607
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:28,104
You see the look of this house, Sir?

608
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:34,521
It was made by Mahdi's dear wife.

609
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:39,229
He hasn't seen his wife
for thirteen years.

610
00:48:41,229 --> 00:48:43,229
He still believes she is alive.

611
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:53,521
They say Saddam Hussein killed all Shias,
including women, children!

612
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:57,521
And some say he was a great man.

613
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,521
Who knows what is the truth?

614
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:04,604
My personal problem is very small.

615
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:08,604
But what this country is going through...

616
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:34,979
Good thing I bought these
cookies yesterday, huh?

617
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,979
We'll add butter, honey, and dates to it.

618
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,979
And then freeze it.

619
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:50,104
It may not be a cake.
But it will definitely look like one.

620
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:59,354
We had been planning this for
so long... Now it's all ruined.

621
00:50:03,729 --> 00:50:05,104
Ruined.

622
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,646
Don't be like that...

623
00:50:10,354 --> 00:50:12,604
What will Papa say if
he sees you give up now?

624
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:19,896
It's not ruined, not yet.
We are still trying. Dad is still trying!

625
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:27,979
Watch! Chintu will be smiling when he cuts
his cake. And you, you will burst the balloon.

626
00:50:29,979 --> 00:50:33,729
Even Grandma will fill her
stomach with the cake.

627
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:41,271
Let's hurry up now!

628
00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:54,979
Chintu! I have some good news
to cheer you up!

629
00:50:55,729 --> 00:51:00,521
The school is totally destroyed now.
When Americans start a job, they finish it!

630
00:51:00,979 --> 00:51:05,021
And it happened on your birthday.
All your friends will remember this.

631
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:09,979
Check this out.

632
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:12,104
Not before cake-cutting.

633
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:13,854
Mahdi Uncle gave that to me.

634
00:51:14,229 --> 00:51:15,396
I still don't know what it is!

635
00:51:15,729 --> 00:51:17,979
We put our life to risk
to reach here.

636
00:51:18,229 --> 00:51:20,229
And he hardly cares
about your gift!

637
00:51:20,604 --> 00:51:23,229
My sister has asked me
not to open it before night.

638
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:25,479
You turn six today!!

639
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:26,979
You are a man now!

640
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:29,646
How can you let your parents
and sister boss you?

641
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,979
No? Then we'll leave right now!

642
00:51:32,979 --> 00:51:34,479
Without eating the cake?

643
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,229
How did you manage that?

644
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:52,229
You still doubt my contacts?

645
00:51:52,604 --> 00:51:54,729
I have many American friends now.

646
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,354
Billy, Steve, Martin...

647
00:51:57,479 --> 00:51:58,479
Charlie!

648
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:01,521
Charlie showed me his night-vision goggles.

649
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:05,979
You know, you can look through
the clothes of girls!

650
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:08,271
He has promised to take me
to America!

651
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:12,354
Once I go there, I'll be rich,
and powerful, Insha Allah!

652
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:17,104
What? You thought I'll keep selling
hash and blue films all my life?

653
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:20,979
Did you watch the DVDs I gave you?

654
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:23,979
My parents said
it was a bad thing!

655
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:25,021
Why?

656
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,271
That was not
'My Friend's Hot Mom!'

657
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:28,979
I will never give you something like that.

658
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,771
You have to grow up man!
Come on!

659
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:33,854
What was there in that CD?

660
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:36,396
I want you to see that...

661
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:39,354
The camp of a secret Mujahid group.

662
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:42,604
Their training.
Videos of suicide bombers in action.

663
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:45,479
They need their voice to be
spread all over Iraq.

664
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:47,396
So I'm their man, to distribute it!

665
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:50,646
If that American
soldier watches all this...

666
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:52,354
He will shit in his pants.

667
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:54,896
Those CDs are in that room.

668
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:58,979
If he spots it
he will hit Dad again.

669
00:53:01,396 --> 00:53:03,354
Reed, this is Jackson! Over.

670
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:07,271
Reed, this is Jackson!
How Copy? Over.

671
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,396
Yes, this is Reed.
Where the fuck are you, man?

672
00:53:14,229 --> 00:53:15,271
Go, go!

673
00:53:17,104 --> 00:53:20,979
It has been a fucking massacre out here!
We got lucky we weren't out in this shit.

674
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,396
What about the Haji?

675
00:53:26,979 --> 00:53:29,104
On my way back now. See you in a minute.

676
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:31,979
Reed! You got me?

677
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:36,271
Roger that! Over and out!

678
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:10,271
Chintu, go, your Grandmom is calling...

679
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:14,604
Let me explain that, Sir!

680
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,104
You lying motherfucker!

681
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:37,479
Get in here!

682
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:40,021
In here NOW! On your knees!

683
00:54:40,396 --> 00:54:45,021
You too! In there, in there!
On your knees!

684
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:48,271
- What in the hell is going on in here, man?
- I'll show you.

685
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,854
Take a look at their home video collection.

686
00:54:55,104 --> 00:54:57,021
Son of a bitch!

687
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,104
Who do these belong to?

688
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,479
Your wife?

689
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:07,979
Is it your son?

690
00:55:09,854 --> 00:55:11,021
Or is it your daughter?

691
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:16,104
Or is your whole fucking family working
for these insurgents?

692
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,521
Don't be so fucking touchy
over some DVDs, all right?

693
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:22,604
What the fuck did you say?

694
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:28,146
Whose side are you on, man?

695
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,729
- Don't you fucking question!
- You went after the Haji, right?

696
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:34,021
What happened?

697
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:35,229
I lost him.

698
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:36,854
You lost him!

699
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:39,104
This reminds you of something?

700
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:42,729
They are cutting our
throats out there, man!

701
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:47,104
They're beheading us like
fucking perverted animals!

702
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:50,271
Why would the insurgents
give these DVDs to them?

703
00:55:51,479 --> 00:55:53,604
Your smart ass knows
this place so well, right?

704
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:55,854
You tell me!

705
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,896
Think about it.

706
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:03,729
They hide the Haji. For all we know
they probably helped him escape!

707
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:06,979
As a matter of fact, they probably
helped build the fucking car bomb!

708
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,979
They treasure the hand of Saddam
as if he were some fucking God.

709
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:11,479
You want me to keep going?

710
00:56:11,646 --> 00:56:13,396
I can keep fucking going, man!

711
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:18,604
Our fucking brothers die for you!

712
00:56:19,979 --> 00:56:22,646
You fucking “civilians”
just go help these terrorists!

713
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:25,604
Listen, they're not even Iraqis, man!

714
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:28,271
Yeah.

715
00:56:28,854 --> 00:56:29,854
Exactly!

716
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:33,104
Then what the fuck are they doing here??

717
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:36,854
Say something.

718
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:47,646
You got nothing?

719
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:56,229
All right!

720
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,979
Don't do this, man!

721
00:56:58,104 --> 00:57:01,729
Don't fuck yourself to
save someone else's ass!

722
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:24,104
Reed!

723
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:31,979
Happy Birthday, Chintu!

724
00:58:03,854 --> 00:58:04,854
No?

725
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:10,021
Anybody?

726
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:30,729
Just tell me who these belong to.

727
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:35,604
I'll let you have your
perfect birthday party!

728
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:38,729
I swear!

729
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,479
I'm not a bad guy!

730
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:31,229
Phone!

731
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:35,646
Important... India.

732
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:38,604
He tell?

733
00:59:42,104 --> 00:59:43,729
Please?

734
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,479
- Hello!
- Hello Sudha!

735
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:05,104
- Namaste Mom.
- Where's Chintu?

736
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:08,229
He's right here.
How did the meeting go?

737
01:00:09,354 --> 01:00:11,479
Let me wish Chintu first!

738
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:20,979
You know I'll break you, right!

739
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:25,271
I'm gonna break one of you.

740
01:00:33,354 --> 01:00:35,354
Quick, give your respects to grandmom!

741
01:00:35,604 --> 01:00:36,979
Namaste, Grandma.

742
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:40,021
May you have a long life
my darling. Happy Birthday!

743
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,021
How's the day going?

744
01:00:42,479 --> 01:00:44,729
It's going really great grandma...

745
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:49,521
What feast has been laid out for you?

746
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:52,771
Here, your grandpa wants to wish you.

747
01:01:01,646 --> 01:01:05,479
It seems your entire gang of
friends is there. Noisy brats!

748
01:01:05,521 --> 01:01:08,896
Yes grandpa! They've all come...

749
01:01:12,979 --> 01:01:13,854
Hello, Dad.

750
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:15,021
What happened to Chintu?

751
01:01:24,979 --> 01:01:28,104
Dad, Namaste!
Did you get to meet the minister?

752
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:30,771
Let's talk tomorrow?
You guys must be partying today!

753
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,729
Of course we are partying!
But tell me what happened at the meeting?

754
01:01:37,604 --> 01:01:38,979
What do I tell you, son!

755
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:44,479
They say all Indians from Iraq
have been evacuated.

756
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:50,229
I showed them your social
security card. Everyone's photos.

757
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,271
I even told him I could
put you on call with him.

758
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:54,271
But he said he was busy with elections!

759
01:01:54,854 --> 01:01:56,229
And that I should come back later.

760
01:01:57,354 --> 01:01:59,729
We waited all day just to speak with him.

761
01:02:01,604 --> 01:02:03,104
What more can we do?

762
01:02:07,729 --> 01:02:09,104
Hello?

763
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:11,979
Madan?

764
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:14,979
What is he saying?

765
01:02:14,979 --> 01:02:16,729
I don't know. He's just gone quiet.

766
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:50,104
Chintu, no... it's okay...

767
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,771
It'll be okay...

768
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:03,896
Sir.

769
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:06,854
Please, come with me.

770
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:08,896
Where're you going?

771
01:03:17,729 --> 01:03:20,271
Now you want to come and talk?
After all of this?

772
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,271
You stupid motherfucker!

773
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:24,729
- Stop!
- What the fuck is his problem!?

774
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,479
What the fuck is going on?

775
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:44,979
Sir.

776
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:48,229
I cannot bear it any more.

777
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:54,854
All my son wanted was a happy birthday.

778
01:03:57,896 --> 01:03:58,979
Even last year...

779
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:09,854
You arrest me!

780
01:04:11,979 --> 01:04:12,979
Put me in jail.

781
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:17,479
I understand Sir.

782
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,979
You are here also
to do your job, no?

783
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,146
It is all my fault only.

784
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,479
My family is suffering because of me.

785
01:04:40,604 --> 01:04:42,979
Why are you doing this?

786
01:04:44,604 --> 01:04:45,604
Why?

787
01:04:50,896 --> 01:04:53,604
My Chintu is crying on his happy birthday.

788
01:04:57,854 --> 01:04:59,146
It is wrong!

789
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,354
So wrong!

790
01:05:10,104 --> 01:05:12,479
I only want ten minutes.

791
01:05:12,979 --> 01:05:13,979
Only!

792
01:05:15,854 --> 01:05:17,729
Let Chintu cut his birthday cake.

793
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:20,146
And then you take me away!

794
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:29,729
I want my family to see that whatever
happened today, Chintu still cut his cake!

795
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:36,646
I know you are not bad people.

796
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:43,771
And when you see that I am
also innocent, you will free me.

797
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:47,979
No, no. That's not how this works!

798
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:52,396
Ten minutes!

799
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:26,229
They've decided to leave.
I insisted they have the cake first.

800
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:31,229
Let's go!

801
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:39,479
Don't just stare at me! Come!

802
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:42,729
It's time to celebrate Chintu's birthday!

803
01:06:52,729 --> 01:06:55,104
Papa, we won't give him any cake.

804
01:06:55,729 --> 01:06:57,604
No no, don't think like that.

805
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:01,146
He has also suffered because
of our Great American Uncle.

806
01:07:01,729 --> 01:07:08,104
We'll give them some cake,
they'll also enjoy your birthday!

807
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:10,604
All set?

808
01:07:14,146 --> 01:07:17,979
It's just a power-cut.
We've got candles, right?

809
01:07:19,021 --> 01:07:20,604
Will you tell me what's going on?

810
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:24,479
Of course, I will.
As soon as we cut the cake!

811
01:08:01,479 --> 01:08:02,521
A little higher.

812
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,479
I should be able to reach it!

813
01:08:19,646 --> 01:08:20,729
Is this fine?

814
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:28,854
Oh! The cake's here!

815
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,104
Bring it on!

816
01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:36,146
Well, what do you think?

817
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:44,979
You see Mr. Chintu!
Looks like a festival in here, doesn't it?

818
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:48,729
Soon we'll celebrate
all festivals back home!

819
01:08:51,354 --> 01:08:53,354
Even the knife looks decorated, no?

820
01:08:54,854 --> 01:08:56,854
Come on. Blow them out!

821
01:09:18,271 --> 01:09:19,479
Now sing it in Arabic?

822
01:09:39,354 --> 01:09:40,646
So? How's the cake?

823
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:45,354
I'm so glad none of them came.
We will eat it all by ourselves!

824
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:03,646
Hello!

825
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:05,479
Brother, Mahdi here.

826
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:10,229
Yes, brother... Very bad network.

827
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:12,354
Those dogs still there?

828
01:11:12,604 --> 01:11:14,146
Listen to me quickly brother.

829
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:15,646
I am going with them.

830
01:11:16,854 --> 01:11:18,896
Please take care of my family.
OK?

831
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:22,479
What the hell! No brother...
They kill you!

832
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:24,729
I will come back soon brother.

833
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:28,896
Don't go brother.
If you go, never come again...

834
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:44,396
OK Sir!

835
01:11:54,187 --> 01:11:55,187
I'm ready!

836
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,060
Blaster Main, this is Fireball 1. Over!

837
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,060
Fireball 1, this is Blaster Main. Over.

838
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,560
How we looking out there? Over.

839
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,100
Fireball 1. Route is clear. Break...

840
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,310
Convoy is resuming its way to you now
for detainee pick-up. Over.

841
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,720
Disregard detainee pick-up.

842
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,970
It's just two of us now. Over.

843
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:07,604
That is a solid copy Fireball 1.
Convoy is returning now.

844
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:11,104
Continue to link up with the
rest of Fireball. Blaster Main, Out.

845
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:16,979
Let's go.

846
01:13:24,104 --> 01:13:25,104
Sir?

847
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:32,104
Kamasutra! You keep your
head down and stay safe.

848
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:48,396
And you get your family
out of this hell-hole, ASAP.

849
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:53,354
Reed! Slow down soldier, I'm coming.

850
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:40,979
Uncle!

851
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:43,771
Sorry!

852
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:56,479
It's okay.

853
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:39,729
Grandma!

854
01:15:40,521 --> 01:15:43,771
Waheed says, Saddam
has many clones of himself!

855
01:15:46,146 --> 01:15:47,146
What are clones?

856
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:49,896
Meaning, he may be gone.

857
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:53,354
But there will be more like him...

858
01:15:56,104 --> 01:15:57,729
Perhaps Waheed is right, dear.

859
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:03,229
There used to be a demon
named, 'Blood Seed'

860
01:16:04,021 --> 01:16:12,021
Whenever his blood touched the earth,
a new 'Blood Seed' would be born.

861
01:16:14,104 --> 01:16:16,021
Hence no one could kill him.

862
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:21,729
Then, Goddess Kali appeared,
a bowl in hand.

863
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:28,146
She killed him in a way that
all his blood stayed in her bowl.

864
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:31,271
Not a drop fell on earth.

865
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:36,479
And that's how Blood Seed was vanquished.

866
01:16:39,104 --> 01:16:41,979
What a story, right!
The bowl solved the problem!

867
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:44,604
Papa is right.

868
01:16:45,854 --> 01:16:48,271
We'll return to India soon.

869
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,729
And your birthday will
surely be celebrated at home!
