1
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,833
As-Salaam-Alaikum
This is capt. Shahid speaking.

2
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:20,333
Ladies and Gentlemen,
we regret to announce that...

3
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,541
...due to the ongoing
tense situation in Islamabad...

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,083
...we have to land
this airplane in Lahore.

5
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,583
We request you to not panic.

6
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,875
All your queries will
be attended at Lahore Airport.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,875
Keep seated, sir.

8
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,375
Don't panic, sir.
Everything will be fine.

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,541
Amidst the commotion created
by this announcement...

10
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,208
...there was only one
question on my mind.

11
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,958
What about my mission now?

12
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,083
Come.

13
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:28,458
"For security sake, Pakistan has
shut down all routes to Islamabad..."

14
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,875
"...and increased security."

15
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:35,041
"The terrorists have once
again succeeded in their motives."

16
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,791
"Yes... Islamabad has been rocked by
six blasts in the most crowded areas."**

17
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,250
Maintain a proper line...
Stay back.

18
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,208
Next.

19
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,541
You're an Indian.
- Yes.

20
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,083
Well...your visa is for Islamabad.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,125
You cannot enter Lahore.
- What?

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,416
You'll be sent to Islamabad by flight.

23
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,250
And until flight services
to Islamabad resume...

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,083
...you will stay at the hotel.

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,208
But I have to get
to Islamabad urgently.

26
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,375
Straying out of your hotel
will be considered illegal!

27
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,458
Actually...
- Akram.

28
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, ma'am.
- Please.

29
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,666
Take this gentleman to the hotel,
and keep an eye on him. - Yes.

30
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,125
Please...
- Please listen to me.

31
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,458
Go on...
- Come with me.

32
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,208
Next.

33
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,583
Keep moving?
- Come.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,583
I need to use the washroom.
- Washroom?

35
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,666
This way.

36
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,166
Come on, hurry up.

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,625
Dead body! Dead body!
- Where?

38
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,708
There's a dead body inside.

39
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,500
Hey...

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,958
Open the door!

41
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,666
The Indian boy has escaped.

42
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,000
I repeat, the Indian boy has escaped.

43
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,458
Will you take me to Islamabad?

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,333
What? Will you take me to Islamabad?

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,291
Hey Bashir what sort
of work have they got us into.

46
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,875
Straight?
- This way.

47
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,541
Straight?
- This way.

48
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,458
Wake up.

49
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,958
This taxi is occupied.
- But it's completely empty, Bhaiya.

50
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,125
Will you take me?

51
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,333
Where do you want to go?
- Islamabad.

52
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,083
Islamabad?

53
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,708
It's urgent, I'll pay you extra.

54
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,541
Sir, money won't
matter when you're dead.

55
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,708
Islamabad is under attack.

56
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,958
I know.

57
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,791
But it's very important.

58
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,333
I cannot wait until tomorrow.

59
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,291
Sit.

60
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,083
Allah!

61
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,583
Will you take me to Islamabad?

62
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,083
You just said it's important.

63
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,833
So one can't argue
when it's important.

64
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,250
Sit.

65
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:26,833
"Mirrors are forged in fire."

66
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:36,833
"Without the oarsman...
the boat's irrelevant."

67
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:44,125
"When you and I come together..."

68
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:55,000
"...the time moves, and
the world seems a better place."

69
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,791
"A sage once said
Be a diamond of love"

70
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:09,541
"A sage once said
Be a diamond of love"

71
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,166
"Let the light in your heart,
and your eyes burn."

72
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,791
"And the world will
never plunge into darkness."

73
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,916
"Keep the light in
your heart...alight."

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,208
"Then the world will
never plunge into darkness."

75
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,250
"Keep walking down the path."

76
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,541
"God bless..."

77
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,125
"God bless..."

78
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,500
"God bless..."

79
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,916
"God bless..."

80
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,625
Why did you stop the car?

81
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,583
Do people in India talk
on the phone while driving?

82
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,958
How do you know I am an Indian?

83
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,125
I have been around a while, Bhaiya

84
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,250
Yes Sure.
Your orders will be complied with.

85
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,041
InSha'Allah.. Allah Hafiz.

86
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,708
What happened?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,625
I got down to pee...
and dropped some coins.

88
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,458
I was just looking for them.

89
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,916
Well, your country's
coins are useless here.

90
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,833
Sit.

91
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,708
'Allah Allah Allah'

92
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,791
Would you like a sip?
- No.

93
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,083
Sit.
- Yes.

94
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:16,750
Sir, why are you risking
your life and going to Islamabad?

95
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,750
It's personal.

96
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,083
Personal?

97
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,041
You see sir...for the terrorists...

98
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,416
...we're ordinary public
- You and me both..

99
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,250
I am risking my life here.

100
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,000
Tell me.

101
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,291
It's a long story.

102
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,125
The journey isn't short either.

103
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,083
After dad's death,
mom had brought me to Dubai.

104
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,291
To my granny.

105
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,416
And I had just one
question for my mom.

106
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,375
When are we going back to India, mom?

107
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,000
We'll stay here now.
- I don't want to stay here.

108
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,458
All my friends are in India.
- Stop it, Sid.

109
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,000
Finish your food.

110
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,541
What is it?

111
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,416
Why do you pinch me every time, mom?

112
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,208
Well...every time you scold my child,
I will pinch you.

113
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,541
Chuchu, don't be upset
over what mom said.

114
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,083
Granny...I am not Chuchu, I am Sid.

115
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,666
Chuchu!

116
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,666
Why do you call him Chuchu?

117
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,333
He never liked that name.
So don't call him that.

118
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,708
That's not a big deal.

119
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,833
Fine, I'll call him
Pupu from tomorrow.

120
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,666
I am very adjusting, you know that.

121
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,500
Pupu!

122
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,791
You're just unbelievable.

123
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,750
No matter how tense
the situation is...

124
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,958
...you always have
a joke for the occasion.

125
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't joke around for fun,
I do it to make others happy.

126
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,500
If I start worrying
about every trivial thing...

127
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,333
...then who will look after my child!

128
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,541
Come, my child.
Take it easy, dear.

129
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,500
Learn to stay happy.

130
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,333
I am happy, mom.

131
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,125
I am just worried about Sid.

132
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
That is all.

133
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,750
I just don't know how to...

134
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,958
How to handle him.

135
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,375
Sid's just like your dad.

136
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,458
Even he loves Tennis.

137
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:30,708
I...will take Sid
to his club tomorrow.

138
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,375
And get him enrolled.

139
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,833
He'll make new friends.

140
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,500
And he'll never talk
about going to India again.

141
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,208
It's not that easy.

142
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,125
Getting admission in
the academy is not easy.

143
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,291
And we don't know anyone there.

144
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,208
Mr. Bhalla.

145
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,083
Bhalla uncle?
- He's the coach there.

146
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,083
After your dad passed away.

147
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,791
...Bhalla ji became...
my special friend.

148
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,666
What?

149
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,541
My boyfriend.
- What?

150
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,875
And he loves me.
- What?

151
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,000
What...what...

152
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,583
Can't I have a boyfriend?

153
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,833
And don't worry.

154
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,750
We only got as far as a kiss.

155
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,583
Mom, I don't want to know.

156
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,791
Mom...please..

157
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,208
Listen to me... she's blushing.

158
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,958
Harry ji...
- Bhalla ji.

159
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,750
'Granny and Bhalla exchanged
a few romantic words...'

160
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,791
'...and I was enrolled in the club.'

161
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,416
'As they say...'

162
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,375
'...every friendship
begins with a fight.'

163
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,916
'Something similar happened
between Fahd and me.'

164
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,291
'I was very short-tempered.'

165
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,541
'And, I often ended up
hurting other's feelings.'

166
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,791
'But one day Granny told
me a really nice thing.'

167
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,625
The one who makes others
happy is the happiest.

168
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:07,916
Right?

169
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,583
'And I set out to make someone happy.'

170
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,541
My child...

171
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,500
Hey...

172
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:19,166
Hey girl...you're the best,
my hope in life.

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,958
Come on.

174
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,416
I am sorry, mom.

175
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,833
I am sorry.

176
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,833
My first day at the club.

177
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,041
And along with Fahd, I met a funny
friend.

178
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,708
Biman. Bangladeshi.

179
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,250
When are you going to serve?

180
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,333
I think I've to get
my glasses changed again.

181
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,208
Biman was funny but not Fahd.

182
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,958
On the first day,
he challenged me to a match.

183
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,083
Fahd's dad was a famous tennis player.

184
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,916
And wanted Fahd to be a tennis
champion as well. - Fahd.

185
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,041
- But due to his Asthma...
- Fahd?

186
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,583
...Fahd didn't have the stamina
to play singles.

187
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,250
'Ya Allah'

188
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,166
And that day after watching
our game, granny said...

189
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,583
Partners.

190
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,291
We're going to rock this now.

191
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,583
'Lashtam-Pashtam.'

192
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,208
'Lashtam-Pashtam?'

193
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,166
My dad used to say it. Anything is
possible if you put your mind to it.**

194
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,500
'Lashtam-Pashtam.''

195
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,875
So 'Lashtam-Pashtam.'

196
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,750
'Fahd looked innocent,
but he was a romantic.'

197
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,750
'He liked an Afghani girl, Madiha.'

198
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,250
'One day we went to Madiha's
dance class dressed as girls.'

199
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,500
'But had to run for
our lives from the Pathan.'

200
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,541
Stop.

201
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,833
Rascals.

202
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,041
Stop.

203
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,125
Hey, stop!

204
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,625
'While trying to escape...'

205
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:50,166
'...we arrived at a place, where we
realized the depth of our friendship.'

206
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,750
I am scared of heights.

207
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,875
So am I Sid,
but not when you're with me.

208
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,583
Come on.

209
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:07,666
Bro, don't ever let go.
- I won't.

210
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,250
'Often there are sorrows hidden...'

211
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,500
'...under the veil of happiness.'

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,250
'Fahd's dad was a heart patient,
and that day...'

213
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,375
My only regret is...

214
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,250
...that I can't see
your winning match.

215
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,375
I am sorry, Fahd.

216
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,541
'Granny promised Iftekhar uncle...'

217
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,083
'...that Fahd and I will not just play
the match together but also win it.'

218
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,041
'And Fahd will stay with us,
in our home.'

219
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,500
'I knew what it meant
to lose your father.'

220
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,125
'And I promised myself
that I will always keep Fahd happy.'

221
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,000
'I was waiting for Fahd to come home.

222
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
And just then...

223
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,375
Sid...
I am sorry bro, please...

224
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,708
Sid...

225
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,875
Leave him, son. Leave him.

226
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,291
Catch him, uncle.

227
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,916
He's going to Pakistan forever.

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Sir, please stop him...please.

229
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,875
Sir, please stop him. Please.

230
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,125
Uncle, please don't take him away.

231
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,541
Sir, please tell him.

232
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,291
I am sorry, Sid. But I have to go.

233
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,500
First my Dad left me,
now you're leaving me too.

234
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,333
Fine, get lost and never come back.

235
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,125
Sid.

236
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,375
Sid.

237
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,333
You came home yesterday, didn't you?

238
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,000
How could you think that
he can live in this house?

239
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,291
A Pakistani.

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,291
Fine, mom.
You and Fahd can stay here.

241
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,333
Sid and I will leave.

242
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:25,583
Badi Ammi,...please don't ever tell
Sid why I left.

243
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,041
Come, let's eat.

244
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,916
Who keeps calling you so often?

245
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,458
Let's go.

246
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,458
As-Salaam-Alaikum , Mr. Khan.

247
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,833
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam, brother Salim.

248
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,166
You haven't been here
in a long time, Salim.

249
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,583
What to do?

250
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not often I get
a passenger for this route.

251
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,333
And you got a fare...on this doomsday.

252
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:46,083
Sir,...such days have now
become the story of every city.

253
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,708
We should get used to such incidents.

254
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,458
Serve him water.

255
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,083
Come, have a seat.

256
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,375
Khan sir, where's the gentleman from?

257
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,166
Doesn't look like a local to me.

258
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,000
You're right.

259
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:09,500
He's an Indian.
He's our guest.

260
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,166
He's en-route to Islamabad
for something important.

261
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,958
Why are they staring at me?

262
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,666
Why are they coming towards me?

263
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,416
Have you ever met Shahrukh Khan?

264
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,500
Forget Shahrukh Khan...

265
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,166
Salman's ruling the roost now.

266
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,875
Have you ever met Salman?

267
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,500
Let's talk about
Shahrukh-Salman later.

268
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,875
How's Big B (Amitabh Bachchan)?

269
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,875
We mean Amitabh of course.

270
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,583
I'm sure you must
have seen him at least.

271
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,458
Actually, ...although I am an Indian,
I was raised in Dubai.

272
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,833
I never had the opportunity
to meet these stars.

273
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,083
Come on buddy.

274
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,500
We're luckier than you are...

275
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,333
At least we see them
every day...on television.

276
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,458
Let's go.

277
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Come on.

278
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,291
Stop scaring the kid.

279
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,916
Were you scared?

280
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,333
Come on, start.

281
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,291
Fans of Indian actors
in Pakistan? Really?

282
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,000
Our countries have been divided...

283
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,166
...but we still share the same soil.

284
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,625
Yes.

285
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,125
Mr. Khan, it was delicious.

286
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,708
Son, wash my hands.

287
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,291
How much?

288
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,333
Oh, sir...

289
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,333
What are you saying?

290
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,416
I can't charge my
Guest. I will go to hell.

291
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,333
May Allah forgive me.

292
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,166
You're our guest.

293
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,541
Allah Hafiz.

294
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:11,833
Allah Hafiz.

295
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,333
That's it.

296
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,708
What were you trying to do?

297
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,208
Nothing...
- Let it be.

298
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:25,875
Lahore is known for its hospitality.

299
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,416
Yes.

300
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,916
Allah Hafiz Mr. Khan.

301
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,916
Allah Hafiz
- See you on my way back.

302
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,291
You are always welcome.

303
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,625
Yes sir, ...let's
continue with your story.

304
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:50,583
Catch it, catch it.

305
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:56,208
And with this ace Siddhant Oberoi is once again
the champion of Inter UAE Tennis Tournament.

306
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,000
Bravo.

307
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,000
Hi, handsome.

308
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,541
Stop staring at me...

309
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,958
Like a pigeon.

310
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,875
Are you hitting on me?

311
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,541
Shameless, I am as old as your granny.

312
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,291
Not granny,... Badi Ammi.

313
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,583
Fahd?

314
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,791
My child!

315
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,708
Sid...
- No!

316
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,625
Why?
- I'll meet him personally.

317
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:43,833
Hello.

318
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,333
No, I am coming.

319
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,250
On my way.

320
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,666
Coming, okay.

321
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,875
Sorry, son...I must go.

322
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,708
But you meet with Sid until then.

323
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,833
Give me a hug.

324
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,250
I'll be back soon.

325
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,375
Hey, carry on.

326
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:17,916
Hey, Wait!

327
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,875
Sorry.

328
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:23,750
If you don't mind...may I?
- I don't mind at all.

329
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,625
I am Biman ul-Haq from Dhaka.

330
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,041
I am the senior-most
player of the club.

331
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,000
How may I help you?

332
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,000
May I?

333
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,083
You want to...My brain...

334
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,791
Of course...go ahead-go ahead!

335
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,541
I'll stand outside.

336
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:52,625
Are you a Tennis player?
- I am...but not a pro.

337
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,416
And you still want to play with me?

338
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,541
Why not?

339
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,291
My friend's dad used to say...

340
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,833
"Anything's possible
if you put your mind to it."

341
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:02,958
"Lashtam Pashtam."

342
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,208
Sid!

343
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:29,541
Sid...

344
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:30,875
Sid...

345
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,375
Sid, listen to me.

346
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,791
What are you doing, Sid?

347
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,375
Leave me, Sid.

348
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,958
What are you doing?

349
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,416
Leave me, Sid.

350
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,250
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

351
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,291
Sid...
- Stay away, Fahd!

352
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,958
What do you think?

353
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,208
I can't stand here alone.

354
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,875
See...

355
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:15,125
I can stand up here...
without you.

356
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,666
Look.

357
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,125
But not me.

358
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,916
And running from that Pathan.

359
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,291
We really got into a lot of trouble.

360
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,791
Hey, Sid...really
good to see you, buddy.

361
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:18,708
You too.

362
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,291
So tell me...
- Yeah.

363
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,208
Why did you come back?

364
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,875
Father wanted to see us win together.

365
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,708
Not just me on a video game.

366
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,833
I want to win the tennis championship.

367
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,083
I need your help.

368
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,375
Bro...we will win.

369
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,875
That's my promise.

370
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,125
Lashtam Pashtam!

371
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,750
Lashtam Pashtam!

372
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,166
Forget all this...

373
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:18,833
Tell me more...any girlfriend,
or wife...or both?

374
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,583
None...

375
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,625
Just that girl...in the dance class.

376
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,583
Who? Madiha?

377
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,541
The one we got punished for.

378
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,375
I see her on Facebook sometimes.
- What are you saying?

379
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,541
Listen...can you introduce me to her.

380
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,583
We'll find someone else if I can't

381
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,833
Listen...

382
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

383
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,750
"Ibn-e-adam."

384
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,291
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

385
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,416
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

386
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,625
"Ibn-e-adam."

387
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,000
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

388
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:18,458
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

389
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:23,250
"If we miss the bus,
we'll catch another one."

390
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,750
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

391
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,083
"Ibn-e-adam."

392
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,416
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

393
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,583
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

394
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,833
"Ibn-e-adam."

395
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,250
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

396
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,458
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

397
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:42,333
"If we miss the bus,
we'll catch another one."

398
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,833
"All fine...and hearty."

399
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:07,291
"No one's a stranger,
all thanks to God."

400
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,625
"A little bit of fun.
A little bit of sorrow."

401
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,041
"Throw away the sadness
And invite happiness over."

402
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,500
"Come, come, come, come."

403
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,083
"Hey bro..."

404
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,333
"...life is a boon."

405
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,375
"The moon's on a high..."

406
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,625
"...jump up and kiss the moon."

407
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,750
"So, do what you
can...and what you enjoy."

408
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,458
"Live like a gentleman
and love like a boy."

409
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,875
"A little bit of fun.
A little bit of sorrow."

410
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,250
"Throw away the sadness
And invite happiness over."

411
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,500
"Come, come, come, come."

412
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,250
"I tread carefully...really
carefully..."

413
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,583
"...thought I won't slip."

414
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,000
"Dad said if you slip..."

415
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,333
"...laugh on yourself
before the world does."

416
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,833
"I tread carefully...really
carefully..."

417
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:54,166
"...thought I won't slip."

418
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,541
"Dad said if you slip..."

419
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,791
"...laugh on yourself
before the world does."

420
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:03,708
"Let's push sorrows over
the Burj Al Arab. - Really."

421
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,166
"Let's spread happiness..."

422
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,458
"...and no sorrows at all.
- No sorrows at all."

423
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,750
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

424
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:11,041
"Ibn-e-adam."

425
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,375
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

426
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,541
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

427
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,791
"Ibn-e-adam."

428
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,208
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

429
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:22,625
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

430
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:27,208
"If we miss the bus,
we'll catch another one."

431
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,083
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

432
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,250
"Ibn-e-adam."

433
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,500
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

434
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,750
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

435
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,000
"Ibn-e-adam."

436
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,416
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

437
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,750
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

438
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:46,583
"If we miss the bus,
we'll catch another one."

439
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,875
Naeem, walk this side.

440
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,750
Really?

441
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,125
I know it was a tough one.

442
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,083
You know...you will never change.

443
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,250
Well, I'll message you.

444
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,916
Naeem.

445
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,833
Naeem. Naeem.

446
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,958
What's wrong with him?
Naeem.

447
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,583
Allah, what's wrong with my son?

448
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,000
Look, I am really sorry,
I didn't mean to...

449
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,958
Will your apology stop his bleeding?

450
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,000
Son...

451
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,791
Is it paining a lot?

452
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Say something.

453
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:51,458
Why isn't he saying something?
- Naeem can't speak.

454
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,791
You should call the police man.
- Yeah.

455
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,041
What are you doing?
- Calling the ambulance...

456
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,708
Who knows when will
the ambulance arrive.

457
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,708
If you want to help,
take us to the hospital.

458
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:06,791
Yes, of course.

459
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,500
Take a left.
- Left.

460
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:17,291
But City Hospital is...
- Just do as I say!

461
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:19,708
Yes!

462
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,041
My son...

463
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,750
Stop...stop here.
- Here?

464
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:38,000
Please Listen to me.
If there is anything I can do for you.

465
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,500
Come Naeem.

466
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,166
I'll be really grateful to you...

467
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,458
...if you don't
mention this to anyone.

468
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,583
Goodbye.

469
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:02,916
'I figured that Zayanah
was living illegally in Dubai.'

470
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:07,583
'Maybe that was the reason she
didn't call the Police or Ambulance.'

471
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,875
As salaam alaikum
- Wa alaikum salaam

472
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,375
Uncle, what are those
tennis balls doing there?

473
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,333
That one?
- Yes.

474
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,583
I think your brother
visits frequently.

475
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,583
He must have kept it.

476
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,833
Brother...

477
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,500
That's what he said.

478
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,208
Let it go.

479
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,708
Hi.

480
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,750
How are you, champ?

481
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,458
Sorry... how is he?
- He's fine.

482
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,541
Good.

483
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,333
By the way, what are you doing here?

484
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,041
Naeem left his bag in your car.
- Oh yes...just a second.

485
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,958
Thank you.
- Okay.

486
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,041
Excuse me,
I can leave you anywhere you want.

487
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,166
Thank you very much,

488
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:31,125
But I won't give anyone
a chance to leave me again.

489
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,083
Goodbye!

490
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:35,625
Goodbye!

491
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,416
Just a second.

492
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,666
Yes. Fahd.

493
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,583
I will make you meet her
tomorrow for sure.

494
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,416
What?
- What?

495
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,000
What are you two doing?
- Looking at her face.

496
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:17,416
What?

497
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,875
He means Fahd's face.

498
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,291
Look at him, he's so shy in front of you.

499
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,333
I see.
- Sid...

500
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,333
What happened to his shyness...

501
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,291
...when he came to my
dance class dressed as a girl?

502
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, it was Sid's...
- Sid.

503
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,416
Are you looking to have
an affair with me or Sid?

504
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,541
Speak up, mister.

505
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,416
Now tell me...

506
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,458
Are you in love with me?

507
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,375
Do you want to kiss me?

508
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,333
What?

509
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,000
Are you going to do it or should I?

510
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,916
Shut up, Biman.

511
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,291
I told you...she definitely
has a connection with Bhatinda.

512
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,250
Bhatinda? What Bhatinda?

513
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,625
It's a city in India.

514
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,958
My granny is from Bhatinda.

515
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,375
And you won't believe...

516
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,500
...that she kissed grandpa
on their first date.

517
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:12,583
I guess your thinking
matches with my granny.

518
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,583
When our thinking's so similar...

519
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:17,791
...then our actions should match too.

520
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,833
You two continue with
your actions and reactions.

521
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:28,583
I am going.

522
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,250
Hey...

523
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,166
Sid.

524
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,916
Hello.
- You? Here?

525
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,625
What are you doing here?
- Trying to make a conversation with you.

526
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:03,916
Huh!

527
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,708
I need to speak with you urgently.

528
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:08,416
This is an insolent effort.

529
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,833
Should I work in the
office or talk to you?

530
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,750
Is your work more
important or...Naeem?

531
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:16,875
Naeem, of course.

532
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,458
Then it's about Naeem.

533
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,833
By the way,
my name is Siddhant Oberoi.

534
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,708
And people call me Sid politely.

535
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:25,875
What do they call
you impolitely? - What?

536
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,041
Did you disturb me during
my work to give your introduction?

537
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,166
Just tell me what you
wanted to say about Naeem.

538
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,541
I've inquired about Dr. Riyaz.
- Yes, so?

539
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:39,250
He's a very good ENT Specialist.

540
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,208
Do you know him?
- Very well.

541
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,833
But maybe you don't
know about his fee.

542
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,625
You don't worry about the fee.
- Why not?

543
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,458
I don't want any
kind of help from you.

544
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,666
And why do you want to do this?

545
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,708
I saw Naeem's book.

546
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:02,125
I can understand the
pain of not having a dad.

547
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,208
And I understand the
pain...of having him.

548
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:11,000
We mother-son are
quite happy in our life.

549
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,666
We don't need your favors.

550
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,875
I...

551
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,833
She has such a bitter tongue,
like a Neem tree.

552
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,416
Oh...

553
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,750
Maybe that's why
she named her son Naeem.

554
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,250
But sister...where could Naeem go?

555
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:36,958
He's not with any
of his friends either.

556
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,000
Allah...where do I look for him?

557
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,041
Who do I tell...

558
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,291
Sorry, but I couldn't stop myself.

559
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,875
Actually,
I took Naeem to see Dr. Riyaz.

560
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,583
And you won't believe it,
but Naeem can speak...

561
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,708
How dare you take my son?
- But I was...

562
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:00,750
What?

563
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,416
Do you know I can get in big trouble?

564
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,583
I know.

565
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,541
That's why I took Naeem's
appointment as my guest.

566
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:12,875
I am stubborn.

567
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,041
Your slap won't make a difference.

568
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,250
Next time I'll bring
Naeem home on time.

569
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,166
Don't worry.

570
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,125
Goodbye.

571
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,375
'Dr. Riyaz said that Naeem's
case was of self-mutism.'

572
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:38,583
'Maybe he stopped speaking
because of a shock.'

573
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,541
'That's why I was putting
Naeem in situations...'

574
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,583
'...where he had to speak.'

575
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:46,791
Look here look here.

576
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,541
Say it... Beach.

577
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,125
Beach.

578
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,041
That's more like it.

579
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,666
Son, say that you want to go pee.

580
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,208
Say it.

581
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,541
No, no, I won't let you go.

582
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,500
Until you don't say it,
I won't let you go.

583
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,666
Say it.

584
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,541
Come on, Naeem,
tell the drive your address.

585
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,583
Fahd, yours.

586
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,500
Fahd.

587
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,625
Thanks.

588
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,458
Hello.

589
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,541
Yes,

590
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,250
Fine, I am coming.

591
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:54,375
Yes,

592
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,333
Sid.
- Sorry, Fahd. I have to leave.

593
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,625
What do you mean you've to leave?

594
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,916
Let's practice tomorrow. See you.

595
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,708
Sid.
- See you.

596
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,833
Why did Sid leave so suddenly?

597
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,875
So what if he left.

598
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,250
I'll help you practice.

599
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,833
I taught Sid.

600
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,958
Come on, let's practice.

601
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,625
Whether it's India or Pakistan,
everyone's scared of Bangladesh.

602
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,916
Come on, rally up.

603
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,875
Girls in Kabul don't wear
mini skirts and hot pants.

604
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:38,291
Yes, some do.
- Really?

605
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,583
But under the burkha.

606
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,250
Hurry up,
I am getting late for practice.

607
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,666
Sid will be there soon.

608
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,166
Really?

609
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,083
But there he is.

610
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,208
Good.

611
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,458
Call him.

612
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:57,541
Let's go together then.

613
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,750
Fahd, in a meeting buddy.

614
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:09,916
Will call you back.

615
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,041
What happened?

616
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,166
Nothing.

617
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,166
Let's go.

618
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:25,291
This is wrong, Sid.
Why did you lie?

619
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,083
We're supposed to take
Naeem to the doctor today.

620
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Fahd wouldn't have understood.
That's why.

621
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,208
Relax, Fahd. Maybe you're wrong.

622
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,333
And there's nothing
between Sid and Zayanah.

623
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:50,333
Madiha, you don't get it.
Try to understand.

624
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:51,916
I do get it.

625
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:56,041
But they invited us and we must go.

626
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,333
Come on, cheer up.

627
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,333
Cheer up.

628
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,333
"I wish this night never ends."

629
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:34,208
"I wish this dance never stops."

630
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,041
"This moment is filled
with no worries."

631
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,875
"There's a restlessness in my heart."

632
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:42,833
"Your spell's growing on me..."

633
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,500
"...I wish it keeps me enchanted."

634
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:50,583
"Cover me in your love..."

635
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:56,583
"...come with me."

636
00:46:56,666 --> 00:47:02,125
"O beloved..."

637
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:06,083
"...come to me."

638
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:34,916
"Let's steal some
moments away tonight."

639
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:38,500
"And say what's in our heart."

640
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,583
"Let's steal some
moments away tonight."

641
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:46,291
"And say what's in our heart."

642
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:50,541
"You're like the dawn in my life..."

643
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:53,833
"...I can feel your
grace surrounding me."

644
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,000
"You're like the dawn in my life..."

645
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,333
"...I can feel your
grace surrounding me."

646
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,583
"I wish this night never ends."

647
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,500
"I wish this dance never stops."

648
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,291
"This moment is filled
with no worries."

649
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,208
"There's a restlessness in my heart."

650
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,083
"Your spell's growing on me..."

651
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,208
"...I wish it keeps me enchanted."

652
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:49,166
"The heart's speaking out to you..."

653
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:52,791
"...there's a story on my lips too."

654
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,583
"The heart's speaking out to you..."

655
00:48:56,875 --> 00:49:00,500
"...there's a story on my lips too."

656
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:04,708
"All I need is your permission..."

657
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:08,250
"...to reveal the
secrets in my heart too."

658
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,250
"All I need is your permission..."

659
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:15,666
"...to reveal the
secrets in my heart too."

660
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,875
"I wish this night never ends."

661
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,750
"I wish this dance never stops."

662
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:25,666
"This moment is filled
with no worries."

663
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,500
"There's a restlessness in my heart."

664
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:31,333
"Your spell's growing on me..."

665
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:34,000
"...I wish it keeps me enchanted."

666
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:39,000
"Cover me in your love..."

667
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:44,666
"...come with me."

668
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:50,541
"O beloved..."

669
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:53,875
"...come to me."

670
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:46,000
Naeem! What did you do?

671
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,958
The Holy Book's wet.

672
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,458
You've become very mischievous!

673
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,041
I'll set you straight...
- Hey Zayanah. What are you doing?

674
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,458
That's no way to hit a kid.

675
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:00,916
Naeem.

676
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,125
Where are you taking us?
- Naeem.

677
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,125
Oh, God.

678
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,875
Why didn't you tell me?

679
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:21,375
Naeem, come with me.

680
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,291
Come on. Let's go.
- Naeem. Naeem.

681
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:24,750
Where are you taking him

682
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:32,000
Sid.

683
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:34,375
Sid.

684
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:35,791
Sid.

685
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,916
Naeem.

686
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:39,875
Taxi! Taxi.

687
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,750
Follow that car.

688
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,375
Hurry up, please.

689
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,375
That...that car...that one.

690
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,000
Come on, you're going to speak today.

691
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,750
Remember, Naeem.

692
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,708
You can't go home...

693
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,583
...without saying
your address yourself.

694
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,750
Never!

695
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:18,666
Naeem.

696
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,958
Naeem.

697
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,458
Leave me!

698
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,000
This is an awful
way to make a kid talk.

699
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,041
Leave me...
- Quiet.

700
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,000
Mother!

701
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:05,375
Naeem. Naeem.

702
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,875
If the pic is nice,
it deserves a like.

703
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:58,166
I was wondering how
this pic got so many likes.

704
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,166
What?

705
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:03,916
By the way, what brings you here?

706
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,458
I thought maybe we
could go out for coffee.

707
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,000
Salaam

708
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:15,000
Here...the best 'Sindhris'
straight from home.

709
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,083
Thank you, Gusal Khan brother.

710
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:23,708
Don't mind, sir...but the sweetest
mangoes are from our country.

711
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:24,708
Alphonsos!

712
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,583
Have you ever tried them?

713
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,833
I have tried them.

714
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,000
But Alphonsos are
no match to Sindhris.

715
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,083
Don't say anything about Alphonsos.

716
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,291
I grew up eating them.

717
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,000
You grew up eating them.

718
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,208
But look at me.

719
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,583
I grew so huge eating 'Sindhris'.

720
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,500
Nothing's sweeter than 'Sindhris'.

721
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:43,250
I am telling you
Alphonsos are sweeter.

722
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,875
Sindhri!
- Alphonsos!

723
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,500
Sindhri!
- Alphonsos!

724
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,666
Sindhri!
- Alphonsos!

725
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,916
Sindhri!
- Alphonsos!

726
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:56,125
This silly quarrel between
India and Pakistan got me beaten up.

727
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,666
And all for this mango.

728
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,125
These Sindhris are really sweet.

729
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,541
Forget this mango.

730
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,750
Let's just jump from here.
- Why?

731
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:11,833
Why?

732
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:15,541
Because you're Pakistani
and I am Indian.

733
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,125
After we're dead, all problems end.

734
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:20,791
Come on, let's jump.

735
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,875
Sid, please wait.

736
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,166
What wait?

737
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:33,291
When Alphonsos and
Sindhris are equally sweet, then...

738
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,083
...where does this
bitterness come from?

739
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:42,958
On that note, Let's just jump.

740
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:43,958
Come on...come.

741
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,083
Wait, Sid. Wait a minute.

742
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:47,250
You're drunk. Leave this.

743
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,166
Leave it.

744
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,500
Leave what?

745
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,250
Whenever I truly
loved someone, Zayanah.

746
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:00,583
They left me alone.

747
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,000
First my father...

748
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,541
Then Fahd.

749
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,958
And now you will leave me too.

750
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:17,083
Because you're Pakistani
and I am Indian.

751
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,833
Come on.

752
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,250
After we're dead, all problems end.

753
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,125
Come on...

754
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,833
Let's jump...
- No...

755
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:34,166
Sid, if you jump...it
will just add to problems.

756
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:38,666
Please, sit down.

757
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:53,083
My problems will increase
when you will leave me.

758
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,541
And with you, Naeem will leave too.

759
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,083
Please don't do it.

760
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,208
I see myself in Naeem.

761
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,208
My childhood.

762
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,958
Zayanah, you're a nice girl.

763
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:51,958
Wear this.

764
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,666
Wear it...quickly.

765
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:59,083
As Salaam Alaikum, sir.
- Wa Alaikum Salaam.

766
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,833
Where are you off to?
- Islamabad, sir.

767
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,916
My mother passed away.

768
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,041
She wasn't even ill.

769
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,958
Sir, what's your name?

770
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:16,583
It's Sid...

771
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,041
Siddiqui Asif.

772
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,583
No matter how many
disguises you put on...

773
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,208
...but you cannot fool me.

774
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Understood.

775
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,875
Come out.

776
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:10,500
Listen to me. - I said come out.
Let's talk about the dead body.

777
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:14,500
The stories in our
films may be weak...

778
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,250
...but, not as much as
the one you're telling us.

779
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,500
Ishtiak, let me tell you a story now.

780
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,625
Indians arrive...and
bring terror along.

781
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:26,041
Please, sir, try to understand.
You're getting me wrong.

782
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:26,958
Shut up.

783
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,208
Sir, I must get to
Islamabad right now.

784
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,125
It's more important for
you to be tossed behind bars.

785
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,625
Once you spend few days behind bars...

786
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,416
Get in!

787
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:42,375
Catch them! Catch them!

788
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:54,708
I want to know what
was the need for all this.

789
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:58,333
I always knew he's not a good guy.

790
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,000
Where are you taking me?

791
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,333
What is this place?

792
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:30,666
Come out.

793
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,000
I said come out.

794
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,375
What are you doing?

795
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:39,500
Risking my life to help you.
- Help.

796
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:41,208
This is no way to help me.

797
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:45,083
You just proved to
them that I am a terrorist.

798
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:49,166
Our countries don't need proof...

799
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:54,666
Finding a Pakistani in India, and an Indian
in Pakistan under such circumstances...

800
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,583
...clearly indicate only one thing.
Terrorist.

801
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,291
And you sir escaped from the airport!

802
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,958
That's like adding insult to injury.

803
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:12,333
For 10 long years, they would've asked
you your motive for coming to Pakistan.

804
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,333
And finally one day...

805
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:16,000
...you would've given up and admitted.

806
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,250
I came here to set off bombs.

807
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:22,583
Hang me.
I want peace!

808
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:31,916
But I still don't understand
why you're helping me?

809
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:42,000
Is it necessary to have
a reason to help someone?

810
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,958
If I were stuck in a
similar situation in India...

811
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:50,000
...would you have asked
for a reason to help me?

812
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,791
My father's grave is in Lucknow,
Hazrat Ganj.

813
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:01,416
For years I wanted to go there
and sit next to his grave and pray.

814
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,000
But how?

815
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,458
Curse these leaders.

816
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:14,500
We're all born from the same soil.
Why do we doubt each other?

817
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,958
I'll call you back.

818
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,583
This Hukumat, she's my wife.

819
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:28,416
She's been calling me since morning,
because she's scared...

820
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,583
...as I am traveling with an Indian.

821
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,125
Who is spreading this hatred?

822
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,625
A handful of
people in your country...

823
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:45,291
...and a handful in mine,
are spreading this terror.

824
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:50,916
For centuries.

825
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:56,333
Was there a Pakistan?
We were one country!

826
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,458
We used to live together.

827
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:03,125
A small spat...but that
happens between everyone.

828
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:07,208
Between families, brothers.

829
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:16,583
Where did this hatred come from?
Who is responsible for it?

830
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:22,750
Why? Why?
Why do we doubt each other?

831
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,208
Sit.

832
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,583
I said sit.

833
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,583
Sorry.

834
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,000
Should I tell you the story further?

835
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,875
Go on...

836
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,416
What do I say...
No one knows about Sid's whereabouts.

837
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,500
I do.

838
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,708
5005, Princess Tower, Dubai Marina.

839
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:09,958
Crazy.

840
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:11,750
Shut up, please.

841
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,500
Forget about showing
up for practice...

842
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,166
...I can't even get him to talk to me.

843
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:20,458
Look...I think you should
let him do what he wants to do.

844
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,583
You should focus on your practice.

845
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,041
This is a double's tournament.

846
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:31,125
"O beautiful moon..."

847
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:34,666
"...make me a mouthful of candy."

848
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:40,125
"Go to sleep, my prince..."

849
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:43,208
Coffee.
- Thanks.

850
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,708
My father used to
sing this lullaby to me.

851
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:50,333
And now, you sing it to Naeem.

852
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:57,291
Has Naeem ever met your parents?

853
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:03,750
No. And, I guess we will never
be able to meet them. - Why not?

854
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,458
I am trying to find out
the procedure you make you legal.

855
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,791
Then you and Naeem
can easily go to Pakistan.

856
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,375
You can make me legal in Dubai, Sid...

857
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,583
...but, not in the eyes of my parents.

858
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,583
They went through a lot
of hardships to get me married.

859
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,125
Even today they proudly
tell everyone that...

860
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:38,250
...our Zayanah lives in Dubai,
like a princess.

861
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,333
They don't know the truth, Sid.

862
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:54,333
I don't have the courage to
face them and answer their questions.

863
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,583
I don't know why
am I telling you all this.

864
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:10,375
There are some people you
don't want to keep secrets from.

865
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:17,750
You're that first person in my life...

866
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,500
Sid, why are you being so naive?
- Naive?

867
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,291
Don't even think...
- You too?

868
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:32,500
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
- No...stop twisting your words.

869
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:33,583
Say it clearly.

870
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,166
What do you mean?
- I mean I admit she has a kid...

871
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,666
...and belongs to a different
religion, she's a divorcee.

872
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,333
Sid, you're getting me wrong.
- Fahd, please.

873
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,166
Just because I am not able
to give you time for practice...

874
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,416
...you have a problem
with my other relationships.

875
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,625
Sid, listen to me.
- You listen to me.

876
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,583
I promised you that I'll
help you win the tournament...

877
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,000
...and I will keep my promise.

878
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,166
It's not about the tournament...
- Don't comment on my personal life again.

879
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,166
Sid, listen to me.

880
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,500
How do I explain you...

881
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:11,875
...there will never be a place
for a Pakistani in your family?

882
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,083
I don't believe it.

883
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:19,625
Look...we're modern as well.

884
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:24,333
But you are just redefining modern.

885
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:31,750
Son...please stay clear of
this divorcee and readymade family.

886
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,375
Think. Think.

887
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,208
Granny, you always say...

888
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,208
Those who think never take action.

889
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:44,375
I cannot live without
Naeem and Zayanah.

890
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:45,875
Sid!

891
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,875
Don't worry, dear. I am explaining
this fool. - Hold on, mom.

892
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:53,708
Have you gone mad?
Pakistani?

893
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,083
I am never gonna let
that happen you know that.

894
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,250
What?

895
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,125
Why are you talking like this, mom?

896
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,458
I wish I had said this 16 years ago...

897
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,500
...then maybe your dad
would've been still alive.

898
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:08,708
Please dear...go inside.
- Just a minute, granny.

899
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:12,250
How is dad involved in all this?

900
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:14,833
When you're talking about
your dad's murderers...

901
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,125
...then he's automatically
dragged into this.

902
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:20,625
For God's sake,
dear...don't go that far.

903
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,791
Do you know that you dad
didn't die in the battlefield?

904
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:31,458
He was murdered in our own house,
by his closest friend.

905
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:34,208
Because he was a Pakistani spy.

906
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,708
Just because your dad didn't
disclose some information...

907
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:41,500
...he slit his throat
brutally like an animal.

908
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:44,375
Come, dear. Let's go.

909
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:50,166
I can endure anything...
but a Pakistani...

910
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,500
Let's go inside, dear.

911
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,291
Let's go.

912
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,333
I'll do anything you say.

913
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,541
But I can't live with those murderers.

914
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,291
Please don't do it.

915
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:07,875
Please.

916
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:44,875
Sid.

917
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,375
Good morning, son.

918
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,791
- Let me sleep, granny...please.
- Get up.**

919
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,541
Get up...get up, son.

920
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,458
Son...

921
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,208
Fahd's called three
times since morning.

922
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,666
Talk to him.

923
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:22,541
Here.

924
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:26,375
Get up, my son.

925
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,500
Talk to him.

926
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,250
Hello.
- Everything alright?

927
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:45,750
Yes.

928
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:49,708
The tournament is starting
in a couple of days.

929
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,041
Let's practice.

930
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,875
You need to practice, Fahd.

931
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:54,333
Not me.
- What?

932
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:56,500
We'll meet on the day of the match.

933
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,500
Sid...

934
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,500
Hello.

935
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,083
Where is Siddhant?

936
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,416
I don't know.

937
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,083
He hasn't been coming
for practice for few days.

938
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,166
Ready, Serve.

939
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:29,625
"The heart's been stabbed,
but the body's is alive."

940
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:34,333
"The body is like a stubborn bird."

941
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:37,375
"The heart's been stabbed,
but the body's is alive."

942
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,666
"The body is like a stubborn bird."

943
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,500
"Keep flying..."

944
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
What's wrong, Harry?
All okay?

945
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:58,750
Sid uncle.

946
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,750
Naeem, careful.

947
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:10,166
Why didn't you come
meet me for so many days?

948
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,041
I am sure you've dealt
with all your important work.

949
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,500
So let's plan for the game.

950
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,166
It's alright.

951
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,708
Good players don't plan...

952
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,458
They just play.

953
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,458
Come on, buck up...

954
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:56,208
You're missing such easy shots,
Sid...where is your focus?

955
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,791
Your focus is on the game, right.

956
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,291
You missed a shot too.

957
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:25,208
That's why I kept insisting
that you come for practice.

958
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:26,500
Teaching a kid how to speak...

959
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,583
...and chasing after
his mother isn't practice.

960
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,041
Stay in your limit, Fahd.
- Play the game...

961
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:32,375
Everyone knows who's
intentionally playing bad...

962
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,958
...and who our opponents are

963
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:37,083
At least stop favoring
your countrymen here!

964
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,541
Hold on a second.

965
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:41,000
What did you just say?
- Get lost...

966
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:43,125
Go and play bad intentionally.

967
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:45,625
How dare you, Sid?
How dare you misbehave?

968
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,458
Misbehave?

969
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,458
Why don't you serve
them this game on a platter?

970
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,041
Don't involve me in this.

971
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,208
You have such cheap thinking.

972
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,041
This is a warning. You must stop now.

973
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:55,791
Mom was right.

974
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:57,750
One should never
trust the likes of you!

975
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:00,541
Then go sit in your mother's lap...
- Fahd!

976
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,541
Sid.

977
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,000
Sid?
- Granny.

978
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,458
Shameless.

979
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,500
What Pakistan? What India?

980
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:14,250
You came here from India
when you were just a kid.

981
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:19,416
And today you're telling us the
distance between India and Pakistan.

982
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,166
Mom Please stop creating a scene

983
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,416
Get lost!
Go away!

984
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,125
This is all your fault.

985
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:27,083
You spread this bitterness.

986
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:33,000
And today I am going to clean
up this mess once and for all.

987
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,833
Harry...
- Enough, Mr. Bhalla.

988
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,125
Be quiet.

989
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:37,375
Granny, listen to me.

990
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,291
And you?

991
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:39,333
What?

992
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:41,208
What is your problem?

993
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,208
Just because one Pakistani
killed your father...

994
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,708
...are you going to treat
all Pakistanis as your enemy...

995
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:51,208
...like your ignorant mother?

996
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:52,375
Granny...please.

997
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,083
Let's discuss this later.

998
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,291
Everyone's listening.

999
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:56,583
So let them listen.

1000
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,583
I am saying this
loud and clear for them.

1001
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:06,416
We already have a lot of issues.

1002
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,708
Issues like Kashmir...

1003
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:09,208
Like Kargil...

1004
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:12,083
Issues of sports...cricket!

1005
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:16,000
The common man isn't thinking...

1006
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,291
...what's happening across the border.

1007
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,833
"What's happening across the border!"

1008
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,500
He's worried about his own family.

1009
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,000
When his children go to school...

1010
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,041
...they don't fall prey
to some terrorist attack.

1011
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:40,166
Their girls...when they step out of the
house, nothing bad happens to them.

1012
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,500
Granny, please...

1013
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,083
Stay back.

1014
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:51,625
And these evil-doers...
are not from across the border!

1015
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:54,291
Listen...

1016
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:57,291
Clean up your own mess first.

1017
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,875
Your mess!

1018
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:00,750
Then think about cleaning
other people's mess!

1019
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,833
Mom...

1020
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,833
Mom
- Stay away.

1021
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,208
Change your thinking.

1022
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:25,583
Change your thinking, you fools.

1023
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:30,250
Look...Dubai won't
tolerate your hatred!

1024
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,541
Neither will your granny!

1025
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,291
And before I kill you two...

1026
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:38,875
...get out.

1027
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,166
Get out!

1028
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:45,125
Get out you Indian
and get out you Pakistani!

1029
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,500
Get out!

1030
01:17:56,416 --> 01:18:00,000
Mom, when is Sid uncle coming?

1031
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,333
Mom, when is Sid uncle coming?

1032
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,666
He's not coming.

1033
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,500
Why not?

1034
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,416
Don't you get it...he's not coming!

1035
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,250
He is never coming again!

1036
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:07,000
"Every inch of my soul..."

1037
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:09,500
"...is humming the song of your love."

1038
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:12,125
"Every inch of my soul..."

1039
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,541
"...is humming the song of your love."

1040
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,166
"How do I convey my pain in words?"

1041
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,750
"Who do I tell about my anguish?"

1042
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:22,291
"I am speechless..."

1043
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,750
"...and you're without a clue."

1044
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,291
"How can we meet..."

1045
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,666
"...since I am the earth,
and you're the sky."

1046
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,500
"Every inch of my soul..."

1047
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:35,000
"...is humming the song of your love."

1048
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,583
"Every inch of my soul..."

1049
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,125
"...is humming the song of your love."

1050
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,291
Forgive me, Badi Ammi.

1051
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,750
When we became friends...

1052
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:52,541
...I didn't know that Indians
and Pakistanis are different.

1053
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:58,041
Some questions have no answer.

1054
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:01,708
Whatever you're doing is right?

1055
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:10,583
Badi Ammi...do I have
your permission to leave?

1056
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:15,708
Will you stay if I ask you to?

1057
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:34,250
"Life is a valuable gift,
you should know."

1058
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:39,208
"Life is a valuable gift,
you should know."

1059
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:44,375
"You never know...when
it'll pass away."

1060
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:49,000
"You never know...when
it'll pass away."

1061
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:52,041
"Come see me know."

1062
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,583
"How do I convey my sighs?"

1063
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:57,208
"How do I show you my grieving eyes?"

1064
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,708
"I am speechless..."

1065
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:02,375
"...and you're without a clue."

1066
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:03,791
"How can we meet..."

1067
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:07,291
"...since I am the earth,
and you're the sky."

1068
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,083
"Every inch of my soul..."

1069
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,500
"...is humming the song of your love."

1070
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:15,208
"Every inch of my soul..."

1071
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,666
"...is humming the song of your love."

1072
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,500
Sid.

1073
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,416
What have you done to yourself?

1074
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,708
I should've never told you the truth.

1075
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:07,208
Relax, mom. It's not your fault.

1076
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:13,583
I am trying...to
hate people like Fahd.

1077
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,000
I'll get there.

1078
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:20,583
"This pain is making me breathless..."

1079
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:23,000
"...hear me, o friend."

1080
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,666
"This pain is making me breathless..."

1081
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,958
"...hear me, o friend."

1082
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:32,875
"Either shower me with love..."

1083
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:37,666
"Either shower me with love..."

1084
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:40,833
"Or alleviate this pain."

1085
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,500
"How do I convey my heart?"

1086
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,000
"Who do I show my tears to?"

1087
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:48,375
"I am speechless..."

1088
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:51,208
"...and you're without a clue."

1089
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,583
"How can we meet..."

1090
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:56,291
"...since I am the earth,
and you're the sky."

1091
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:58,875
"Every inch of my soul..."

1092
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,416
"...is humming the song of your love."

1093
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,958
"Every inch of my soul..."

1094
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:06,458
"...is humming the song of your love."

1095
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:09,125
"How do I convey my sighs?"

1096
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,541
"How do I show you my grieving eyes?"

1097
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,125
"I am speechless..."

1098
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:16,666
"...and you're without a clue."

1099
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,291
"How can we meet..."

1100
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:21,791
"...since I am the earth,
and you're the sky."

1101
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,416
"Every inch of my soul..."

1102
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,333
"...is humming the song of your love."

1103
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,541
Papa...please help me.

1104
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:33,416
Girl, you're the best.
The hope in my life.

1105
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,083
- Hey...
- Dad

1106
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:37,083
Come here.

1107
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:44,250
By the way, dad.
What do you write in your diary?

1108
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,708
Son, whenever I am confused...

1109
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:49,250
...I write my feelings in this diary.

1110
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:52,250
And your confusion's cleared?
- Yes, son.

1111
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:55,208
Just write your feelings on paper.

1112
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:58,791
And your heart will tell
you what's right and what's wrong.

1113
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,041
While writing my story...

1114
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:45,250
...I was able to get some
answers to my questions...

1115
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,375
But not satisfaction.

1116
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:52,625
My story was incomplete without Fahd.

1117
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:57,875
So Granny wanted me to go to Pakistan
to meet Fahd.

1118
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,333
No, granny.

1119
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:03,416
I don't want to meet Fahd.

1120
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:08,875
Chuchu...

1121
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:15,083
Son...why are you still delusional?

1122
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:21,958
Today I'll tell you something...

1123
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:29,541
...which I haven't even
told your... silly mother.

1124
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:33,708
Watch...

1125
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,875
Move back.

1126
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:45,041
This is India 70 years ago.

1127
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,583
Now we...

1128
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:58,041
divide this in two parts.

1129
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:07,291
This is your India...and
that's his Pakistan.

1130
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:15,083
Then we drew a line between the two

1131
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,875
...and called it 'Border'.

1132
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:22,291
Back in 1947,

1133
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:28,750
my dad found me here.

1134
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:39,083
No one knows whether
I...came from here...

1135
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:44,041
...or whether I came from here.

1136
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:53,291
Whether I am Hindu or Muslim,
no one knows.

1137
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:05,583
Now...if we see this biologically...

1138
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:13,666
...then maybe I have Pakistani blood.

1139
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:19,291
The blood of a Pakistani Muslim.

1140
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:25,625
And if I've Pakistani blood...

1141
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:30,750
...then that same blood
runs in your silly mother.

1142
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:36,166
Or if someone could do
a detailed study of my blood...

1143
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:41,291
...and find out what's right...

1144
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:50,541
No, son...be quiet.

1145
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:51,750
You shouldn't cry.

1146
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,125
I am sorry.

1147
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:56,291
Only donkey's cry.

1148
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:10,958
Mom.

1149
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:33,750
Even I hid something from you.

1150
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:36,541
How could you think
that he can live here?

1151
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:37,958
A Pakistani?

1152
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:40,416
After knowing the truth
about Fahd, I realized...

1153
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,541
...that he was never at fault.

1154
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,666
Sometimes, Mom kept him away from me.

1155
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:48,125
While other times, I did so myself.

1156
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,541
Sorry, Sid.

1157
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:03,375
When you meet Fahd,
please apologize to him for me.

1158
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:24,958
Look...my story ended...
and we reached Islamabad.

1159
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:27,041
So, I finally got you here.

1160
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,375
The police are still after us.

1161
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,500
Look, son.

1162
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,666
I tried my best.

1163
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:46,958
But you don't worry,
Allah will surely help you.

1164
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:56,541
The address you're looking
for is not too far from here.

1165
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:57,708
You'll get there sooner on foot.

1166
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:59,208
Go on, I'll handle them.
- But you...

1167
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:02,875
Don't worry about me, go on.
- Okay.

1168
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:04,583
Run.

1169
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,875
Uncle, which way is Sector F.

1170
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:17,375
Take a left.

1171
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,958
Find him.

1172
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:23,875
He must be somewhere around.

1173
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,750
Which way is sector F?

1174
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,041
There he is.
Catch him.

1175
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,625
You cannot escape.

1176
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,708
Catch him.

1177
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,583
Move.

1178
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:38,166
Come on. Come on.

1179
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:44,125
I won't spare you.

1180
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:46,375
Hey...

1181
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,041
You cannot run too far.

1182
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,541
Look.

1183
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:02,666
Where is he?

1184
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:06,166
You two look that way.

1185
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:11,291
There he is.

1186
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:21,291
Move.

1187
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I am coming...

1188
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:38,541
You cannot escape.

1189
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,791
Leave me.

1190
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:41,250
Heyyou.

1191
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,166
Move aside.

1192
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,291
Fahd.

1193
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:33,583
Fahd.

1194
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,583
Stop. Stop, or I'll shoot.

1195
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:36,375
Fahd.

1196
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:38,291
Fahd.
- Keep sitting or you'll die.

1197
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:41,416
You made us run a lot.

1198
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:44,000
Sid.

1199
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:45,333
Fahd.

1200
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:46,666
Fahd. Come here.

1201
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:48,000
Stay back, lady. Stay back.

1202
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:50,625
Sid.. - This terrorist
was trying to enter your house.

1203
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:51,875
Sir...sir...

1204
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,125
Sir, listen to me...

1205
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:54,250
Madiha, please explain to them.

1206
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:55,333
Fahd...

1207
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,666
Call the commissioner.

1208
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:59,416
Call the commissioner.

1209
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,500
- He's not a terrorist.
- Get him inside.

1210
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:02,125
Listen to me.

1211
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:03,541
Come to the police
station immediately.

1212
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:04,833
Come to the police
station immediately.

1213
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:05,958
Fahd. Stop them, Fahd.

1214
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,208
Come to the police
station immediately.

1215
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,583
Alhamdulillah

1216
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:21,916
Promotion.

1217
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,500
Finally I've got
my hands on an Indian.

1218
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:27,666
Soon I'll be in-charge
of a police station.

1219
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:29,958
And three stars on my uniform.

1220
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:31,083
As Salaam Alaikum sir.

1221
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,250
IG sir.

1222
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,791
Let the Indian go.
- But, sir...

1223
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:40,625
I get it...but we
have to follow the orders.

1224
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:43,125
Get the paperwork ready.

1225
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:54,208
It's your responsibility
that he leaves our country tomorrow.

1226
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:03,041
Fahd. I knew you would forgive me.

1227
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,041
Thanks brother.

1228
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:07,750
I only helped you so that...

1229
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:11,166
...you don't say that
Pakistanis are cruel.

1230
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:12,958
You may go.

1231
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,541
Goodbye.

1232
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:15,958
Don't say that, buddy.

1233
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:18,250
I went through great
troubles to get here.

1234
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:20,833
And I got into trouble
after meeting you.

1235
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,000
I think it's best you leave.

1236
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:31,416
This Pakistani no longer
wants to be friends with an Indian.

1237
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:03,000
You will take the first
flight out to Dubai tomorrow.

1238
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:04,541
Yes.

1239
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:48,500
What happened to Sid?

1240
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:49,750
Is he okay?

1241
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:52,458
He's fine.

1242
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:54,958
He'll be sent back to Dubai tomorrow.

1243
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:58,500
What is this?

1244
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:00,916
Nothing.

1245
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:17,833
Look son...Allah's our biggest friend.

1246
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:22,875
If He wills...He will
return your friend to you.

1247
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:26,208
And I am sure it will happen.

1248
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:30,916
Brother Salim, you have
changed my thinking.

1249
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:35,791
I now look at life through
a different point of view.

1250
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:41,041
I will always remember
everything you did for me.

1251
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,583
Allah hafiz
- Bless you.

1252
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:49,625
At least tell me the meaning of
Lashtam Pashtam before you leave.

1253
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:52,791
What you did for me.

1254
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:55,083
By risking your life.

1255
01:38:57,791 --> 01:39:03,541
Doing something with
passion is Lashtam Pashtam.

1256
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:05,583
One way or another.

1257
01:39:09,041 --> 01:39:14,833
Siddhant sir...you forgot your
bag at Fahd sir's house yesterday.

1258
01:39:16,791 --> 01:39:19,458
Where is Fahd?
- He left for London.

1259
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:23,083
Goodbye.

1260
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:16,875
Sid.

1261
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,333
You're my life,
my reason to stay alive.

1262
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,000
I love you, man.

1263
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:27,083
Thank you.

1264
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,541
Thanks...for writing the
final chapter of our story.

1265
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:44,000
I did write it Sid,
but we're yet to make it happen.

1266
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:29,541
Come on, come on, come on.
Faster.

1267
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:43,833
"God be with you."

1268
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,041
"God be with you."

1269
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:52,125
Finally the day
Fahd had been waiting for has arrived.

1270
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:55,166
We're at the finals of Nations Cup.

1271
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:58,416
And the dream of Fahd's father
is very close now.

1272
01:42:17,166 --> 01:42:20,458
Are you both stressed?

1273
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:26,000
Look son, winning and losing
is not in the hand of the players.

1274
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:30,458
But playing well is.

1275
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:34,208
Just play well.

1276
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:37,208
Don't just play with each other.

1277
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,875
Play for each other.

1278
01:42:40,916 --> 01:42:43,166
Then no one can defeat you two.

1279
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:46,916
Bravo.

1280
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:14,583
'Zayanah, Whenever I loved someone,
they left me.'

1281
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:26,000
Yeah.

1282
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,166
Yeah.

1283
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:42,625
Yeah.

1284
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:45,583
Sid uncle, I love you.
- I love you too.

1285
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,458
"God be with you."

1286
01:43:58,416 --> 01:43:59,833
"God be with you."

1287
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:02,125
"God be with you."

1288
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:04,666
"God be with you."

1289
01:44:05,166 --> 01:44:07,958
'Mom was right,
we should never trust you people.'

1290
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:11,125
'Then go hide in your mother's lap!'

1291
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:22,500
Lord...let them win.

1292
01:44:22,666 --> 01:44:24,708
And I'll give you a tight hug.

1293
01:44:51,583 --> 01:44:55,291
Bro, don't let go.
- I won't.

1294
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:08,708
God is the greatest friend. If He wills,
He will bring your friend back.

1295
01:45:09,375 --> 01:45:12,000
Siddhant and Fahd have
won the Nations cup.

1296
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:14,625
"It's the celebration
of our victory..."

1297
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:16,916
"...the flag of love soaring high."

1298
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,375
"It's the celebration
of our victory..."

1299
01:45:19,458 --> 01:45:21,708
"...the flag of love soaring high."

1300
01:45:21,791 --> 01:45:25,750
"May the bud of love blossom forever."

1301
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:30,750
"May this relationship last forever."

1302
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:33,750
"May the bud of love blossom forever."

1303
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:36,166
"May this relationship last forever."

1304
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,208
"Salute to this relationship."

1305
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,833
"God be with you."

1306
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,125
"God be with you."

1307
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:44,708
"God be with you."

1308
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,166
"God be with you."

1309
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:49,416
"God be with you."

1310
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:51,875
"God be with you."

1311
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,125
"God be with you."

1312
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:56,708
"God be with you."

1313
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,250
"God be with you."

1314
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,625
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

1315
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:28,833
"Ibn-e-adam."

1316
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:31,250
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

1317
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:32,458
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

1318
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:33,708
"Ibn-e-adam."

1319
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:36,125
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

1320
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:40,500
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

1321
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:44,666
"If we miss a bus,
we'll catch another one."

1322
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:46,916
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

1323
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,125
"Ibn-e-adam."

1324
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:50,500
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

1325
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:51,583
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

1326
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:52,875
"Ibn-e-adam."

1327
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,250
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

1328
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:59,750
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."

1329
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:04,458
"If we miss a bus,
we'll catch another one."

1330
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,541
"All fine...and hearty."

1331
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:28,958
"No one's a stranger,
all thanks to God."

1332
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:31,208
"A little bit of fun.
A little bit of sorrow."

1333
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:33,666
"Throw away the sadness
And invite happiness over."

1334
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:36,208
"Come, come, come, come."

1335
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:39,625
"Hey bro..."

1336
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:40,958
"...life is a boon."

1337
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:42,083
"The moon's on a high..."

1338
01:47:42,166 --> 01:47:43,333
"...jump up and kiss the moon."

1339
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:45,541
"Do what you care...what you enjoy."

1340
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:48,166
"Live like a gentleman
and love like a boy."

1341
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,625
"A little bit of fun.
A little bit of sorrow."

1342
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:55,166
"Throw away the sadness
And invite happiness over."

1343
01:47:57,666 --> 01:48:00,208
"I tread carefully...really
carefully..."

1344
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:02,500
"...think I won't slip."

1345
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:04,875
"Dad said if you slip..."

1346
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:07,208
"...laugh on yourself
before the world does."

1347
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:09,458
"I tread carefully...really
carefully..."

1348
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:12,000
"...think I won't slip."

1349
01:48:12,083 --> 01:48:14,458
"Dad said if you slip..."

1350
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:16,541
"...laugh on yourself
before the world does."

1351
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:21,583
"Let's push sorrows over
the Burj Al Arab. - Really."

1352
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,083
" Let's spread happiness..."

1353
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:26,375
"...and no sorrows at all.
- No sorrows at all."

1354
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:27,666
"Lashtam Pashtam..."

1355
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,750
"Ibn-e-adam."

1356
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:31,291
"Stay happy for as long as you can."

1357
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:35,750
"Doesn't matter if we can't find her,
we'll find someone else."
