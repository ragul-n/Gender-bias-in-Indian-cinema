00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,880
Maya, why are you ignoring me?

2
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,720
Maya, I come behind you every day.

3
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
I love you, Maya.

4
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,560
I keep talking,
but, you are ignoring me.

5
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm talking to you only.

6
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
I love you so much.

7
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,400
Maya, I'm asking you.
Reply me.

8
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,400
Whatever you said now,
say it tomorrow too.

9
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
Then I'll tell my decision.

10
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Okay, I'll wait for you here and the
same time. Bye.

11
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,480
Hey, who's that?

12
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,360
Who?

13
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Hey, who are you?

14
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Hey.

15
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,200
Who's that?

16
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,600

you're destined to die.'

Meenakshi...

20
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Swamy, did you see
my daughter?

21
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,880
No, Swamy.

22
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Where has she gone?

23
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,200
Kumar swamy, did you see
my daughter?

24
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,000
What happened?

25
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
I went to get the offering of god.

26
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,040
Wonder, where she left meanwhile!

27
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
Swamy, you search that way.

28
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,680
- Okay, brother.
- I'll search this way.

29
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,160
- Tell me, if you see her.
- Yes, swamy.

30
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,120
Meenakshi...

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Meenakshi...

32
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,680
Lord Ayyappa!

33
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,200
Please, give back my child safely.

34
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
Dad!

35
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,600
Where did you go, dear?

36
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,680
I was in search of you, dad.

37
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
Dad!

38
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,880
God saved me!

39
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,120
Which god, dear?

40
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
There...

41
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:49,320
(A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa)

42
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,240
Swamy...

43
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Swamy, you've saved my child.

44
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,120
Thank you very much...

45
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
Swamy!

46
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Dad, I need biscuit.

47
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,960
Come, I'll get you.

48
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,280
Where did he go?

49
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Dear, you shouldn't go
anywhere leaving dad.

50
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Leave the way, Swamy.

51
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,440
(A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa)

52
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,440
Swamy...

53
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,800
If you're here, then the one
who saved my child...?

54
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,640
Is he the lord, then?

55
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,920
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

56
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Swamy.

57
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
Just now I spoke to you
and came by rear door.

58
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,640
You create tales
in between that.

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,200
You lost the child when gone
to have donated food...

60
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
...and you expect god
to save your child?

61
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,160
Already, problems are mounted
on god to toss out.

62
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,680
You must take care
of your child.

63
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Go...

64
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,760
You make a series
in between.

65
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

66
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,600
Uncle, upon hearing your high voice,
the lord might go to Andhra pradesh.

67
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,080
Pray calmly.

68
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Maa...

69
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,360
Ayyappa...

70
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
Lord...

71
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,760
Swamy! swamy!
Be careful.

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
- What happened?
- Nothing.

73
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,560
Come, step slowly.

74
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,480
A well mannered guy in this
generation!

75
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Swamy...

76
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
- Hey, look at his head.
- Swamy, be quiet.

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
When the priest blessed him
with sacred grains...

78
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
...it didn't stay on his head.
- Be quiet.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Swamy...

80
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,040
A man can live with bald head,

81
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,600
But shouldn't lead a bare life.

82
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,920
You're yet to come up in life.

83
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
Don't get his curse.

84
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,440
Give respect to elders.

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,680
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

86
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,640
Praise the Lord!

87
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm watching everything from
the moment I came.

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:48,120
Wonder, how devotional, submissive
and respectful, Vijay is!

89
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,480
Is Vijay married?

90
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
No.

91
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,560
Why are you asking?

92
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,720
My daughter works
in a software firm.

93
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,800
I'm looking for a marriage proposal.

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
I think of getting her
married to Vijay.

95
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
- Swamy, get up.
- What happened?

96
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Swamy get up.

97
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
Did I say anything wrong,
for him to faint?

98
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,720
Swamy, get up.

99
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,640
What did you say?

100
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
You've seen Vijay
only in devotional stance.

101
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,360
But, you didn't see
his contradictory.

102
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
(Song from 'Vedhalam')

103
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
You dog!

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
He has started again.

105
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,360
Shit!
Dog.

106
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,080
Hey, how dare you bark at me,
who saved you once?

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
You've become so pompous.

108
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,400
Okay, Come.
Let's see who wins.

109
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,400
(Song from 'Vedhalam')

110
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,880
Oh no, how to sleep?

111
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,880
Oh no!

112
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,520
(Song from 'Vedhalam')

113
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,960
Crazy, to whom are you
competing?

114
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,280
Take it, Swamy.

115
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
Does he behave so?

116
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
For me?

117
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,240
Take it.

118
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,240
He doesn't look like that.

119
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,040
Can't you see the people
around you?

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,240
Leave the dhoti down.

121
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,840
Can't you behave decently in public?

122
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,560
Ask Guruji,
what he needs?

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,440
Excuse me, don't throw the
cups here.

124
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
- Swachh bharat...Clean India.
- Okay, swamy.

125
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,480
If you do these,
you'll be named as 'Anti-Indians'.

126
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,800
I can't believe you
when he has such a decent uncle.

127
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
You mean, decent?

128
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Hey, goof.

129
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
Uncle...

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,240
Dude.

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
- Uncle...
- Dude.

132
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
Shit!

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,520
What an indecent act of you,
when everyone is sleeping?

134
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
My wife doesn't want
to keep my attires in this wardrobe.

135
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
It was the dowry
from her parents.

136
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,720
So, going to bang with it
on her mom's head.

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,800
Egghead, you're an
affectionate person!

138
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,520
Above that, you're a
sensible person!

139
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Vijay, what nonsense is going on?

140
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Your nuisance is waking up
the entire colony.

141
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,320
Drunken morons.

142
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Shit.

143
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,960
Mr.Doctor,

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,640
This is our own problem.

145
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,840
Better, don't poke your nose.

146
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Else, I'll yell at you
in cuss words.

147
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
If you don't understand,
shut your trap.

148
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,720
Who asked you
to see all these?

149
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,960
You...get in.

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,920
Uncle, a man shouldn't cry.

151
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,560
- Master...
- A man shouldn't cry.

152
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,760
- Master...
- Uncle, don't cry...

153
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,680
- Master...
- I'm coming.

154
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,680
He has started again.
Ask him.

155
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
- I'll take care, wait.
- Master.

156
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
- Vijay will listen to me.
- Master...

157
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,680
- He has more respect on me.
- Master...

158
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,560
- Uncle.
- He blabs.

159
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,960
It's not good, taking booze and
creating ruckus every night.

160
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,280
What's your problem,
tell me?

161
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
I'll sort it out.

162
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,160
On Saturdays, when taking head bath...

163
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,880
...if I try to take the soap,
it falls into the closet.

164
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Will you come to take that
with your hands?

165
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,440
Dear, he's asking you to take it.
Get inside.

166
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,600
Ladies are around.
Behave decently.

167
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
You go inside,
I'll come.

168
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,520
Here it is.

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
Get inside.

170
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
It has become a routine
for you.

171
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,400
Come, let's complaint
to the president.

172
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,520
It has become a routine
for them daily.

173
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
- It's menacing.
- What's happening here?

174
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,080
Why are you drunk and
creating ruckus here?

175
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
If I get angry, then
I won't leave you.

176
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
Whose brief is this?

177
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
- Do you've Aadhar card?
- Why now?

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,440
Now, Aadhar card is must,
if you go dead to the graveyard.

179
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
- Wait I'll call the police.
- You've crossed the expiry date.

180
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,200
Go away.

181
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,440
Get the aadhar card, can't keep
your body for more than a day.

182
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,280
What's this, dear?

183
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,800
Give respect to elders.

184
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
- Do you want respect?
- Oh no, my legs.

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
Do you want respect?

186
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,640
- Do you want respect?
- Viji...

187
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Viji...what's this?

188
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,080
Non-veg, I ate chicken.

189
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Viji, see who has come?

190
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,680
Who is that mushroom head?

191
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,800
He is the President...

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,080
Isn't Ramnath Kovind, the President?
Is he the President now?

193
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,880
Uncle, it's the president.

194
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,200
Left, right...left, right...
About turn.

195
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,320
- Viji, what's happening here?
- Shouldn't we sleep.

196
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,360
Did you take the medicine?

197
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,440
- No...
- Not yet?

198
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,400
Take the medicine, Go...

199
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
No, he hits him not even
considering his age.

200
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,800
Dude, it's the police.

201
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm not the police,
but a thug.

202
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,120
- We can sleep peacefully, here after.
- You made a call to the police.

203
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,680
Are you a thug! go...

204
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Is it true?

205
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,120
(A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa)

206
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,840
It's irrelevant to what I witness
and to your narration.

207
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,480
Swamy, still you don't believe us?

208
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,640
Come to watch the fun, now.
You'll know, then.

209
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,800
(A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa)

210
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Praise the lord.

211
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Look here,
after taking the Mudra mala,

212
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,120
You mustn't take booze
for three days.

213
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,640
How dare you say that, monkey faced?

214
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
When everyone is taking booze
on the way itself,

215
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,520
Why're you framing new rules?

216
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,960
- How dare you call guruji as monkey?
- Is he Aravind swamy, the actor?

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,280
Look at his face,
he looks like a monkey.

218
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,720
Hey, you must be...

219
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
Sorry to everyone...

220
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I shouldn't talk so, to guruji.
Sorry.

221
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,720
Swamy, drinking is one's
personal choice.

222
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,160
Why are you...?

223
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,840
Guruji, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't talk filthy.

224
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
- It's my fault.
- Sorry, swamy.

225
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,520
How did they step into devotion,
when they behave audacious?

226
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,720
They didn't. Someone must have,
when they were sleeping.

227
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,080
But, they aren't aware
that we did.

228
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,560
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

229
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,120
Praise lord...

230
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,840
Viji, you're wearing the mudra mala.

231
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,400
Uncle, you too wear the same.

232
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,920
Hey, who did this
when we were sleeping?

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
Do you think, we'll be scared
if you put the mudra mala?

234
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
Dude, remove that.

235
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,000
Viji...

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,360
Without a valid reason,
you mustn't take off the mala.

237
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
Dude,
my body won't withstand.

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
It's related to god.

239
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,360
Any rules and regulations
to take it off?

240
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,360
It's possible,
only if someone dies.

241
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Dude!

242
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,280
Oh no...
God...

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,280
Save me.

244
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,560
- Hold him.
- What happened?

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,480
Uncle, Is he dead?

246
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,440
No.

247
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
Just missed.

248
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,160
Shit.

249
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,640
What's going on
between you and Viji?

250
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
That's nothing.

251
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,600
Known that, if anyone dies...

252
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,360
...we can take off this mala.

253
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,960
So we tried, but missed.

254
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Whom to try next...?

255
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,840
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

256
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,520
It's okay.

257
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
What will you do, after he takes off
the mala as soon as you reach?

258
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,760
God has to take care
of everything.

259
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,240
Maya.

260
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,640
Sir.

261
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,480
One minute.

262
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Okay, sir.

263
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,240
I'll be back.

264
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,480
Sir.

265
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,000
Why weren't you seen yesterday?

266
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,800
Sir,

267
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
I asked permission
for two days.

268
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,520
You mean, two days?

269
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
It's been four days.

270
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,960
Sir, I went to Kerala.

271
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
Is the Kerala government
paying your salary?

272
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
- Sorry, sir.
- Then?

273
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,800
Sorry sir, I didn't
get the ticket.

274
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
Is the ticket you mean
for Mohanlal's movie?

275
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,760
Why are you laughing?

276
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm very upset with you.

277
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
Sir, what I must do now?

278
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,080
That's good.

279
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,080
Today, you're joining
me for lunch.

280
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
I need to do some
important discussions with you.

281
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
Right?

282
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,480
- Okay, sir.
- Don't delay.

283
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes baby!

284
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,840
I completed my medical studies
so easily.

285
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,520
But, it seems very difficult
to propose Maya.

286
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,840
Somehow,
I must convey her, today.

287
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,240
I shall do it, Karthik.

288
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,960
Yes, you can.

289
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
Maya, 'I love you'.

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
Shit.

291
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,240
'I love you'.

292
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,080
It's alright.

293
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,320
Maya, 'I really love you'.

294
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,080
Shit.

295
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,000
Once again.

296
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,360
Maya, 'I love you'

297
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,520
Doctor, Maya has left as she got
an urgent call.

298
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,440
She told me to inform you.

299
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,280
What? It somehow goes missing.

300
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,360
Praise Lord Ayyappa!

301
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,640
Thank god.

302
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
Ayyappa!

303
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
Wine shop?

304
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,680
You dare to put Mala while sleeping?

305
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,840
How could all of you sleep today?

306
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
What is he doing?

307
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
Is he going for a long journey?

308
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,400
Oh no, he is watching.

309
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,160
- What's that?
- Don't know, mom

310
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,680
Oh God!

311
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,200
Ganesh Chaturthi pooja has been
arranged in our colony.

312
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,600
You must come for sure.

313
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
Very happy.
I'll definitely come.

314
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,960
- And make the festival grandeur.
- You must come.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Keep it inside.

316
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,440
Hey Kiruba, donate the bazaar's one day
collection to the festival.

317
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,640
Thank you very much, sir.

318
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
Very happy.
Take leave.

319
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
Greetings, boss.

320
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
- Palani, are you fine?
- I'm fine.

321
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,320
Boss, why did you donate money
for that zone?

322
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
Why shouldn't we give?

323
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
We can't paste a poster or
fix a banner there.

324
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,600
Is it butter milk outside and
booze inside?

325
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,200
If you do anything in my street, again...

326
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,080
No Viji, if my boss is aware of this...

327
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
Go and tell your boss.

328
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,360
If he does all these
in Viji's place,

329
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,480
The line drawn on the banner
will be on his face.

330
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,200
Who's that?

331
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,560
It seems that Chockalingam, a big shot
was there in our party.

332
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,240
- He is his grandson.
- Is it?

333
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,400
His grandfather died for the
sake of the party.

334
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,680
But, when his mother
died in an accident...

335
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,800
...no one helped him from the
locale and from our party.

336
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,480
He behaves odd,
from that day onwards.

337
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,840
Is he creating ruckus
to that extent?

338
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,240
Okay, we'll handle him next time.

339
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,520
Hey, take the pieces first.
Don't give plain biryani.

340
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Take that biryani.

341
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Has anything fallen
into the biryani?

342
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,840
You're searching in the tub,
when I sound like a cat.

343
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,040
Are you mixing
the meat of cat?

344
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,480
Bhai shop biryani is for,
'Quality, faith and honesty'.

345
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,720
Is he Hansika, the actress?

346
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,400
Hey, get lost.
Go and get the bag of onions.

347
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,080
Come, Vijay.

348
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,000
- Have you brought the load?
- Yes, boss.

349
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,360
Take it.

350
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll call you in the evening for load.

351
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,920
Parcel a pack of biryani
with leg piece.

352
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,120
- Dear.
- Tell me,

353
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,720
You borrow from the neighbour,
the side dish of your food.

354
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,800
But, buying biryani now.

355
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,040
Have you got
money for free?

356
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
I'm coming here
for ten years.

357
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,560
Your house is nearby, why do
you take so long years to come?

358
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
I mean,
I'm regularly coming here.

359
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,200
- What's that in the hand?
- Shirt.

360
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Is it?

361
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,200
You got two.

362
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
If you buy one,
get another for free.

363
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,040
I'm getting a shirt free
without buying anything.

364
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
How, dear?

365
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,800
Like this, dear.

366
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,120
Dear, what you do is not good.

367
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,400
Yes, I'll take this.

368
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
Dear, give.

369
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,000
Though you're a regular customer,
give me the money.

370
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,720
- It's routine for you and Viji.
- Give me the money.

371
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
- Leave me.
- Either give the parcel or money.

372
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,880
Maya.

373
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,840
I wish to talk to
you in person.

374
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,480
Tell me, sir.

375
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
Don't call me 'sir'.

376
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,120
Call me, Karthik

377
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
Tell me, Karthik.

378
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,920
That sounds sweet!

379
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Maya.

380
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,360
I love you

381
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,560
Listen to me, Karthik.
go away from here.

382
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,560
No.

383
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
Go away, Karthik.

384
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,840
I love you

385
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Where has she gone?

386
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Hey, open the door.

387
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
Hey, open...

388
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,320
Hey, look here...

389
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,920
Sir, what happened?

390
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,640
'If you dote this virgin,
you're destined to die.'

391
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
What, dear?

392
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Are you all fine?

393
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,960
(A devotinal song on Lord Ganesh.)

394
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,160
(A devotinal song on Lord Ganesh.)

395
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,840
Pour it, dude.

396
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Uncle, is this okay?

397
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,720
Dude, it's of little difference.

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,360
Measure it right.

399
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
See now.

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,280
Oh,no. Again it's a mistake.
Pour in that.

401
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,720
- Now?
- Pour it, dude.

402
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,080
What?

403
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
I was checking
the measurements, dear.

404
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,560
Are you mindless?

405
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,480
If he has mind, wouldn't he hit
a better chick?

406
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,120
- Hey, come here.
- Yes, coming.

407
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,480
Why do you behave like this
at this age?

408
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
It's same only.

409
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,480
Take it.
Look now.

410
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,640
Cheers.

411
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,200
(A devotional song on Lord Ganesh)

412
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,680
I thank the few people
who applauded.

413
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,400
Another name of Lord Pillaiyar
is 'Ganesh'.

414
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,680
Our brother has donated
for this concert.

415
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,040
If there exists any problem,
in this Chockalingam colony.

416
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,040
Our boss will stand for us.

417
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
Why are you doing like that?

418
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,440
This colony is named
after your grandfather.

419
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,160
Instead of giving you
the due respect...

420
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,120
...they show respect to him.

421
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,840
Why are you provoking me?

422
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,360
I want you to rise in life.

423
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,640
-he'll teach you not to
spend lavishly.

424
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,280
-even the colour of currency will change,
but not his attitude to donate.

425
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,400
-the hands which has turned red
by donating...

426
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,800
Our philanthropist brother Mu.Pa...
He'll donate more.

427
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,920
We thank him with
love and affection.

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,680
Shit, if I listen to him
speaking like this,

429
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,160
I get enraged.

430
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
He doesn't get tired to donate.

431
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,440
We praise his glorious soul.

432
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,280
A beautiful song,
dedicated to him.

433
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,440
"He gave everything."

434
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,280
"For whom did he give?"

435
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,800
"Did he give for only one person?"

436
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,600
"No he gave for all..."

437
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,400
"He gave everything."

438
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,280
What did he give?

439
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,600
 "For whom did he give?"

440
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,600
To whom did he give?

441
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
"Did he give for just one person?"

442
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,160
"No he gave for all..."

443
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,520
He gave shit.

444
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,600
When the boss is here,
he is doing like this.

445
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
Mic Maran,

446
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,800
'His greatness!'
'Revolutionary leader!'

447
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,160
'People's star!'

448
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,240
He has donated for all.

449
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,120
It's appreciable if you sing
a song in praise of him.

450
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,920
That's okay.

451
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,480
Whom did he give?

452
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,200
He gave to his illicit wife.

453
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,800
Keep silence.

454
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,560
Hey...

455
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,120
Go and graze the cows
that way.

456
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,040
Then, what you said?

457
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
So, his hands turned red
on donating?

458
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,480
Was he giving sindoor
in the temple?

459
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
Hey uncle, don't laugh.

460
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,720
He is fuming.

461
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,160
Look at him.

462
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,320
He is leaving, uncle.

463
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,040
Hey, I'm watching you.
You're crossing your limits.

464
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,360
Kiruba.

465
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,040
Wait.

466
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,920
It's normal at festivals to indulge in fuss
with the influence of booze.

467
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
We shouldn't bother all those.

468
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
Did you understand?
Come, let's go.

469
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,360
Sir...

470
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,320
No, I'm not angry.
I'm leaving.

471
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,400
You continue with the concert.

472
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,200
I'll leave.

473
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,480
Laugh...

474
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Laugh well...
Bye.

475
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,520
Ask him, what he want?

476
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
- Viji, it's not good.
- You too don't look good.

477
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,680
Isn't your wife
living with you?

478
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,360
I'll hit on your head with the mic.
Go and sit.

479
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
- Hey, egghead.
- Give mic to me

480
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,600
- Take it
- Go away...

481
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,880
We are sorry for
the interruption.

482
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,480
The musical programme continues
with the voice of Maran...

483
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,000
Go ahead, Maran.

484
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,360
- Viji...
- Come, uncle.

485
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,120
Will you please tell me,
about whom I must sing now?

486
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,960
About whom?

487
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,640
- Sing about my uncle.
- Dude, I'm feeling shy.

488
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
Uncle, don't feel shy.

489
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,160
About him?

490
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,680
Sing about his attire...

491
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,560
I'm feeling shy.

492
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,280
Sing about his physique.

493
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,640
Sing about his loony attitude.

494
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,960
Instead of singing about him,
I'll sing about you.

495
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,760
Okay.
Then, sing about me...

496
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Dude...

497
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,800
Uncle, what?

498
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
Ready, start.

499
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,120
"Crazy, to whom are you competing?"

500
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,000
"Crazy, to whom are you competing?"

501
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,240
"Hey bash,
If I let go, it booms."

502
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,200
"Start off, slap off,
Get rid at once..."

503
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
"Either you hanker or
you don't hanker,"

504
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
"I told you to shut your trap."

505
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,720
"Curb your hostile feeling,
you'll get slapped."

506
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,200
"If our buddy comes,
the locale is like a fine flour."

507
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,080
"If he is not there,
the locale is like sour batter."

508
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,920
"If I barge in, your face
will be torn and sheared."

509
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,000
"If I hit you, your head
goes staggered."

510
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,200
"Come on...come on...
Breach up..."

511
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,680
"Come on...come on...
Breach up..."

512
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,920
"We are tip-cars,
You don't be silly."

513
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,520
"You aroused the lion..."

514
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,440
"Crazy, to whom are you competing?"

515
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,120
Hey come on, boys

516
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,120
"Crazy, to whom...?"

517
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,840
"Crazy, to whom...?"

518
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,720
"Hey, a monkey was
caught by a goof, in a tree."

519
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,840
"The oldster's attire was grabbed
who went to catch the monkey."

520
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,360
"Check in the Facebook, Instagram
and Twitter..."

521
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,240
"...the likes and shares goes
countless,when posting the snaps"

522
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,960
"The loss and labour are
like dust to our brother,"

523
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
"Our boss, highly the mass
in the locale,"

524
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,520
"Our boss, highly the mass
in the locale,"

525
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,240
"Don't let down the goal,
you won't thrust,"

526
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,160
"Always enjoy your life,
you'll triumph in all sorts."

527
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,720
"Hey, food at home...
Booze on road..."

528
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,760
"Be with me...
Ever to enjoy..."

529
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,240
"We are tip-cars,
You don't be silly."

530
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,720
"You aroused the lion..."

531
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,600
"Crazy, to whom...?"

532
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,440
"Crazy, to whom...?"

533
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
Sure sir.
I'll do it.

534
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,240
Definitely.
On the way sir.

535
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Hey,

536
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,880
Good morning, sir.

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
- Hey,
- Good morning, sir.

538
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
I greeted you.

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,400
Hey, who need your greetings?

540
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,480
I can't lift my hand.

541
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,960
Get me the medicine.

542
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560
I must go to office urgently.

543
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
Can't you sweep late today?

544
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm the team leader.

545
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,360
You mean, without doing any work,
always finding faults on people...

546
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,040
...who work under you,
isn't it?

547
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,720
What is this, like a
percussion player? Go.

548
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
Get me the medicine.
My hands are paining.

549
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,480
Hey, come here.

550
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,840
Where do you take me?

551
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,200
Viji is not well,
can you get him medicine?

552
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,200
He has joined me.

553
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,680
Viji, don't mistake me.

554
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,360
I must go to job, urgently.

555
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,480
Hey, everyone says
the same right from the morning.

556
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,520
Everyone in this world
will say that they go...

557
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,720
...for jobs in the morning.

558
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,680
You've got up early today
because of the pain in hand.

559
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,560
That's why, this confusion.

560
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,280
Hey,

561
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,760
Come here.

562
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,680
Are you calling me?

563
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
Can't you know, that's you?
Come.

564
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,520
Come, doctor.

565
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
What's the problem, Viji?

566
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,720
Yesterday, as I banged them,

567
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,880
I can't lift the hand.
Do you have medicines for that.

568
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,080
I'll check.

569
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
Are you going to
shave my underarms?

570
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,080
Viji, I'm a doctor.

571
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,920
Okay.

572
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,840
I'll see.

573
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,560
Tell me, whether it's painful?

574
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,040
- Is it paining?
- Yes.

575
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,280
Is it paining?

576
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,080
Sir, do you need an auto?

577
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,800
Is it like calling an auto,
when I'm getting slapped?

578
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,720
Get lost.

579
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,120
Come.

580
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,360
Wonder, all the doctors
are the same.

581
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,600
You keep asking
whether it's painful?

582
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,120
Do something.

583
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,120
I'll message you an ointment.
Apply that.

584
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,120
Buy it for me.

585
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,640
You're teasing more.

586
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,520
Hey, egghead.

587
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,680
Karthik.

588
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,720
Why are you looking somber?

589
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,680
Are you okay?

590
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Don't call me, 'Karthik'.

591
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,080
You can call me as 'sir'.

592
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,840
Okay, sir.

593
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,120
That sounds good.

594
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,280
What happened, sir?

595
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,880
Nothing.

596
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
Hey, Maya.

597
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,440
Sister.

598
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,720
- Sister, when did you come here?
- Just now.

599
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,080
- Is everyone fine at home?
- Yeah.

600
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,800
- Sister, you don't have any problem, right?
- No, I'm okay.

601
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,760
It's been long time
since we met.

602
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,400
- Do you know that girl, Maya?
- Yes, I know.

603
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,320
We belong to the
same place, Chottanikkara.

604
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,720
'If you dote this virgin,
you're destined to die.'

605
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,160
I wonder, what medicine
he gave.

606
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,360
The pain is aggravating.

607
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,360
Hey, alien faced...

608
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,560
Why are you acting
like a monkey?

609
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,320
It's an exercise, dude.

610
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,240
You're teasing me as
I can't lift my hand.

611
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,920
Call the doctor.

612
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,640
Do you have a pricking sense
in heart?

613
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,120
I feel so, when you're asking.

614
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,640
Do you feel like
an elephant banging you?

615
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
No, I feel like it blessed me
after getting five bucks.

616
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,200
Why are you asking all these?

617
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,320
All these are the symptoms
of heart attack

618
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,040
Do you think of yourself
as a cardiac surgeon?

619
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,880
Dude...

620
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,520
I can't even hit him.

621
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,080
Excuse me.

622
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,360
Who is she?

623
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,560
- Who is Viji here?
- I'm Viji.

624
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,720
Who are you?

625
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
Dr.Karthik has sent me.

626
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,480
Where is he?

627
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,440
Hello sir, don't
strain yourself.

628
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,080
The pain will be more.

629
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,080
Just relax.

630
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,080
I've come to treat you
by physiotherapy.

631
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,280
Uncle, she wants to
give something.

632
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
Get that and send her.
Go.

633
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,440
Drop in this.

634
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,440
Sir, physio is a treatment.

635
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm here to give treatment
for his pain in hand.

636
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
Are you drunk?

637
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Don't lie.
I have to give treatment.

638
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,240
He told me that I'll get rid
of the pain, if I take booze.

639
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,080
How will you sleep?

640
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,000
I will sleep freely.

641
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,640
You said that I shouldn't
lie to doctor.

642
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,880
Not that, I asked about the position
of your hand when sleeping.

643
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,480
He doesn't know where he
sleeps when drunk?

644
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,480
You're asking him
how he sleeps?

645
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,520
You go ahead.
It's good.

646
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,640
It's not good.
Shut up.

647
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,640
Remove your shirt.

648
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,920
Dude, shall I stay out?

649
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Give that.

650
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
Can't you be quiet?

651
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Can I get hot water?

652
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,400
Hot water...

653
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
Is kitchen available here?

654
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,280
- I'll get on my own.
- There...

655
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
- No, just a minute.
- Don't worry.

656
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,680
- Don't go there...I'm telling...
- It's very clumsy.

657
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,760
- Tell her.
- It's a bachelor's house.

658
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,360
- Who is she?
- Don't know.

659
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,560
Where is the match box?

660
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,280
Is there a match box?

661
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,800
It's near my mom's photo.

662
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
Dude

663
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,920
Dude, it's an old type of
love, falling at first sight.

664
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,320
How to fall in love
without seeing, you goof.

665
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,880
Sorry, uncle.
I blab because of pain.

666
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,960
It's okay, dude.

667
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,240
Come to the hospital,
at a stretch of three days.

668
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Okay?

669
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,680
Sharply at 8 a.m.
Okay, bye.

670
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,240
Dude,
I know your feelings.

671
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
You're an auto driver.

672
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,560
She is a doctor.

673
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,560
It won't work out.

674
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,440
I'll try my best
with other acts.

675
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,760
Shut your trap.

676
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,680
- The water has become cold.
- Is it?

677
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,880
Are you saying,
it won't work out?

678
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,360
Oldster, who'll it be?

679
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm also seeing like you only.

680
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,640
Will she be his relative?

681
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,640
He doesn't have any other
relatives apart from his uncle.

682
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
Are you wondering at the girl
who has come to Viji's house?

683
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,800
- Who is that girl?
- I sent her.

684
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,280
Are you running out
of income?

685
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,240
Nonsense.

686
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,120
I have a plan.

687
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,560
You people will not
understand.

688
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,520
How many days
Viji tortured us?

689
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,040
He is going to suffer
for everything.

690
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,640
How?

691
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,920
If we en masse and make him
to love her, that's enough...

692
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
...his chapter will be closed.

693
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
- That means?
- Super.

694
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,440
It's over.

695
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,520
Do you know
who her father is?

696
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Is he a big hooligan?

697
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,160
No.

698
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,040
A politician?

699
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,240
More than that.

700
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,640
'Chottanikkara
Mukkanni graveyard'

701
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,400
Swamy, my problem is
with my daughter.

702
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,720
She loves a guy who is not
right for our family status.

703
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,720
But, she...

704
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,640
Do you have that guy's attire
and the sand he stepped into?

705
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,640
Now, the chief priest is going into trance.

706
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,120
Now, the bad and the
soul of the dead will come back.

707
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,000
No one should be
afraid or get scared.

708
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,200
Guruji, will come back
from trance in ten minutes.

709
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Now, by the power
of my pooja,

710
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,480
See what happens to the guy
who loves your daughter.

711
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,640
Chanda...

712
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,520
Witchy oldster,

713
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,760
What, dude?

714
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,720
Get up, we have to go.

715
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
The wine shop opens
only at 12 o'clock.

716
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,680
Are we going
to get it illegally?

717
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
I'll hit you.

718
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,120
She told us to come at 8 a.m
for physiotherapy.

719
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,480
What?

720
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,360
Come, let's go.

721
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,760
I'll brush and come.

722
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,640
Anyway, it'll stink after smoking.

723
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,480
- Come.
- Dude, I haven't wear the shirt.

724
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,000
Dr. Karthik, orthopedician.

725
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,680
Sir, register the name at reception
and wait.

726
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,360
Is any out patient here?

727
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
You?

728
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,080
OP?

729
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,280
Tell me, are you OP?

730
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,120
She is asking whether
we are out patient?

731
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,480
Not him. It's me.

732
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,160
I was asked to come for physio,

733
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,440
- Referred by Ortho doctor.
- Viji.

734
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,320
Dr. Karthik...

735
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
Hey Viji, I made you to
wait for long time.

736
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
It's okay, doctor.

737
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm very sorry.

738
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
Preethi, they are my neighbours.

739
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,480
Let them wait in my
physiotherapy room.

740
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,640
- Viji, I'll be back.
- Okay.

741
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
- Come.
- Yes.

742
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,640
When you got injured
in head at a brawl,

743
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,080
You took it easy.

744
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,200
But, just for a sprain
you've come to hospital, now.

745
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,920
I didn't come, uncle.

746
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,440
She made me to come.

747
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,440
She was looking deep
into my eyes.

748
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,920
Did you notice that?

749
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
See now, though there are
many patients...

750
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
...she'll come as a sweet laddoo
to meet me.

751
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,680
As you said,
a laddoo has come.

752
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,600
But, it's Tirupati laddoo...

753
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,240
Who is the patient here?

754
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,480
- He is.
- Hey, what?

755
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
- Don't lie that it's not paining.
- He is lying.

756
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,600
It's not me. It's paining.

757
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,040
- Maya.
- Sir.

758
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,320
I asked you to treat Viji.

759
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
What are you doing here?

760
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,960
Sir, Dr.Geetha has said
she'll take care of him.

761
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,480
That's why, I'm looking at
the report of this patient.

762
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,560
It's not important for me.

763
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,800
Go and attend Viji.

764
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,840
Okay, sir.

765
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,440
Maya, just a minute.

766
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,840
Advice Viji not to take drinks,
when giving treatment.

767
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,840
Sir, that's normally
advised to all patients.

768
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
Absolutely.
But Viji is not normal,

769
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,760
You must say him
with utmost care.

770
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,720
Because, he is my neighbour.

771
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay, sir.

772
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,080
You got me caught, right?

773
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,200
Geetha,

774
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Doctor calls you.
I'll attend him.

775
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,040
I told you, right.

776
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,040
Hey Viji, how are you?

777
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,960
Are you feeling better
than yesterday?

778
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,120
You came for this moment.
Look at her.

779
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,760
After getting up in the morning,
if you do this exercise...

780
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,480
...ten times for two days,
it'll be quite normal.

781
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
Come, let's go.

782
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,560
Then, you shouldn't take alcohol
till the treatment gets over.

783
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,040
What? Shouldn't take drinks?

784
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,280
Why does he gets tense,
if I tell you not to take drinks?

785
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,360
He'll get free booze
from me.

786
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,200
Dude.

787
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,680
I'm telling for your goodness.

788
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,800
Are you aware of the
side effects of taking alcohol?

789
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,400
Failure of liver, pancreas,
increase of sugar and...

790
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,560
...cholesterol levels, and
even heart attack.

791
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,480
Maya, are you advising him a lot,
just for a sprain?

792
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,480
Are you so caring on Viji?

793
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,080
It's alright.

794
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,720
Viji, don't be careless
neglecting the treatment.

795
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,640
Because, bones are important
in the anatomy of human body.

796
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,760
Doctor, do you know which is
the weakest bone in our body?

797
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,080
Asking me?

798
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,640
He is a funny fellow.
He is questioning an Ortho doctor.

799
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,480
It's lacrimal.

800
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,160
No doctor.
Show your hand.

801
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,040
Don't you feel like electrocuted?

802
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,560
This bone, doctor.

803
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,480
Okay, I'm leaving, doctor.

804
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

805
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,200
- Come, you're going to get knocked.
- Bye.

806
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,880
Bro, don't hit at that sister's house.

807
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,000
Viji, are you playing cricket?

808
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
Hit well.

809
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,920
I asked you to hit the ball,
but you hit my butt.

810
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,720
See now, how I'm going
to tease Viji?

811
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,120
Viji, we want six.

812
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,480
We want six.

813
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,840
We want six.

814
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,520
Throw the ball.

815
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,360
We want six.

816
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,920
Oh God!

817
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,880
He thinks of him as Arya,
always accompanied by women.

818
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,480
Master, what are you
searching for?

819
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,440
Throw the ball.

820
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,760
I'm searching for that.

821
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,880
Here it is.
Catch.

822
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,800
He hit very hardly.
It's paining.

823
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,400
Dude, it's enough of playing cricket.

824
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
Come, let's have booze
and play.

825
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,440
I was advised not to drink
till the treatment ends.

826
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,560
I don't want, uncle.

827
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,920
Oh, as that girl advised,
you stopped drinking.

828
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,800
How many times our locales would've
asked you to stop drinking...

829
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,200
...did you ever listen to them?

830
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,600
The locales told me
for their goodness...

831
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,000
But she told me
for my goodness!

832
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,400
Come, let's have booze.

833
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,480
- Come here.
- Brother...?

834
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,720
- You carry on...
- Come, let's drink.

835
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,800
Uncle, when I'm not interested,
why are you spoiling me?

836
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,960
Am I spoiling you?

837
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Tell me, am I spoiling you?

838
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,160
In whatever modulation
you speak, it's you spoiling me.

839
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,000
Are you defying your uncle?

840
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,240
- In the death bed of your mom,
- You weren't here.

841
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,320
When your father died,

842
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,200
You were in inebriated condition.

843
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,440
You speak, whatever you want.
I can riposte for all.

844
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,680
Will he drink?

845
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,840
Take it, dude.

846
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,200
I was thinking that happiness
lies only in intake of alcohol.

847
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,840
Yes.

848
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,520
But, now I feel happy,
if I think of her.

849
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,720
Then, why I must take this?

850
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,320
Dude...

851
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,280
"Knitty-knotty thug
driven into willy-nilly."

852
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,520
"The guy who went on a spree
tip-toed and got hedged."

853
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,120
"Got hedged."

854
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,920
"Got hedged."

855
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,920
"Till now, I wasn't so..."

856
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,200
"I never spoke alone,
I never smiled alone."

857
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,400
"She created arson
in my heart, oh...oh..."

858
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,920
"She played a game of love
with her beauty,"

859
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,920
"Let the silence speak out...
Speak out..."

860
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,080
"Hey beauteous lass...
beauteous lass..."

861
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,120
"Hey I shuffled like a kite...oh..."

862
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,880
"I was totally shattered
when you looked at me, oh..."

863
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,000
- Hey catch...
- Who's that, thief?

864
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
Shit! Is it love?

865
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,960
"In the down pours,
under an umbrella,"

866
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,040
"We both will go alone..."

867
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,160
"In the storm, like a tree,
I fell to your beauty..."

868
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,320
"Twining the fingers and
when looking at your face,"

869
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
"The shyness ingests you."

870
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,480
"Like you, my heart beats
for a young one."

871
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,520
"With a ploy, oh...oh..."

872
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,720
"She made him to fall."

873
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,760
"With a ploy, oh...oh...
She lifted him."

874
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:41,120
"I forgot myself when
you see me, dear."

875
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,800
"I shuffled like a kite...oh..."

876
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,000
"I was totally shattered
when you looked at me...oh..."

877
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,080
"I shuffled like a kite...oh..."

878
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,960
"I was totally shattered
when you looked at me...oh..."

879
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,560
Tell me, Viji.

880
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,760
You wanted to say something.

881
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,880
Tell me, what's that?

882
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,800
The food I buy goes waste.

883
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,760
Why?

884
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,040
I feel the food like a poison.

885
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,480
I can't eat.

886
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,480
See, how skinny I've become.

887
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,640
I was thinking, only the intake of
alcohol gives me happiness.

888
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,840
You made me to realise,
that happiness is different.

889
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,840
If you stay with me,
throughout my life.

890
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,320
I'll be very happy.

891
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,080
I'll take care of you too.

892
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,680
I can understand.

893
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,480
I'm a reckless fellow.

894
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,560
You think, how to trust me?

895
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,120
The speed breaker
will set right...

896
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,120
That is...everything will be set
right after marriage.

897
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,160
I'm blabbering in anxiety.

898
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,920
- That's why...
- That's why?

899
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,200
It'll be good if you tell
your decision today itself.

900
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,120
I can understand, Viji.

901
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,600
I'm going to my native,
tomorrow.

902
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,560
After I'm back,
tell me the same thing again.

903
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,760
Then I'll respond.

904
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,000
Hello, I can't bear till then.

905
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,640
Finalise it now itself.

906
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,000
You tell me the same again.
Then I'll respond.

907
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,880
You want me to say again?
I'm telling you now itself.

908
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,600
I'm telling you
at this moment.

909
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,800
'I love you'

910
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,800
First, you leave from here, Viji.

911
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,160
Reply me.
I love you.

912
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,600
Go home carefully, Viji.

913
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,240
- Hello...
- First leave.

914
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,840
I'll rove around like a ghost,
until you accept my love.

915
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,360
Listen to me.
Go.

916
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,680
I love you

917
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,040
Don't get into problems
voluntarily.

918
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Why? Are you going to
get me an offer?

919
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,800
You might kiss me on the lips,
if I permit.

920
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,960
Stay back.

921
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,320
Don't stand here.
Go away.

922
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,560
Don't stand here.

923
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,040
- Why are you chasing me away?
- Go away.

924
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,320
Have you asked any
girl to come here?

925
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,640
First, you leave from here.

926
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,080
Go away from here.

927
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,680
I'm telling for your goodness.

928
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,000
Go away.

929
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,920
Do you know
what happened to Viji?

930
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,080
His phone is not reachable.

931
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,640
So, our plan has worked out.
Isn't it?

932
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,200
Yes.

933
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,640
I was waiting for this
good news to sleep well.

934
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,640
He shouldn't raise up, after hit
by her, proposing his love.

935
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,880
I'm expecting that to happen.

936
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,320
Doctor, the auto has come.

937
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,000
God bless you my child.

938
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,320
You said he'll be collapsed,
but he comes fresh.

939
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,880
Why are you here
as a crowd?

940
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,880
Viji, what happened?

941
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,360
Did you convey
your love to her?

942
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,800
Hey, Viji...
Superb!

943
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,560
Don't behave like monkey

944
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,680
Oh, it's our pleasure to see
Viji feel happy.

945
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,600
Yeah.

946
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,600
Master has good talent.

947
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,800
You blinked your eye in a moment,
isn't it?

948
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Run away...

949
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,720
Will you go without
getting caught?

950
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,680
Why do you all await
for my love proposal!

951
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,920
- Is it a setting?
- That is...

952
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,280
No...leave that, Viji.

953
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,920
In the same romantic mood,
if you go to bed soon, you'll get that...

954
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,800
What's that?

955
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,480
Love...Pyaar...Romance, Viji.

956
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,840
Enough of shaking your stomach.
You didn't do anything funny?

957
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,040
He'll die when he enters his house
and gets hit by the ghost.

958
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,360
'If you dote this virgin,
you're destined to die.'

959
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,440
Don't worry about anything, Viji.

960
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,200
Visit the mosque on Friday.

961
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,400
Everything will be fine.

962
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Your uncle is telling something.

963
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,920
What happened, Viji?

964
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,040
You've told everyone.

965
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,200
Have you come to ask again?

966
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,560
Not that, we can't believe.

967
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,240
Hey, you want the ghost
to hit him again...

968
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,640
...just for the sake
of your belief.

969
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,560
We found the reason for this.

970
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,200
Yes, Viji.

971
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,480
Maya! With whom you're in love.
It's her father.

972
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,880
Yes, only he do this
black magic and witch craft.

973
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,840
Our Viji will thrash even
fifty henchmen.

974
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,040
He has sent a ghost.

975
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,240
Is he pompous though
a magical plaintiff?

976
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,560
He is also a human.

977
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,000
Anyhow, his daughter will
be married to someone.

978
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,480
Why that shouldn't be
our beloved Viji?

979
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,640
Absolutely.

980
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,000
It's easy to manage,
if her father dwells here.

981
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,160
What can we do,
when he is in Kerala?

982
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,440
Guys go from continent to
continent for the sake of love.

983
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,440
Kerala is a nearby state.

984
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,080
We'll accompany you,
if you are afraid.

985
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,440
Hey, how dare you ask him
whether he is afraid?

986
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,240
He thrashed his senior
in school days.

987
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,440
He has seen many hooligans.

988
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,200
Let's leave, dude.

989
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,520
We aren't afraid of anyone.

990
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,240
We have made others
to be afraid of us.

991
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,880
Don't think
Come

992
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,040
Uncle, why have we come here?
inquire them?

993
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,360
I've asked for chicken and egg.
It'll come now.

994
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,240
If I slap you,
your ears will rove.

995
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:08,840
How?

996
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,880
It'll rove.

997
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,240
Now, did you understand
what to ask for?

998
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,640
I'll ask. Wait.

999
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Hi all,

1000
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,760
There is a strap thief,
a bear king here...

1001
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,880
Where is his house?

1002
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,680
What happened, uncle?

1003
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,800
Everyone is shocked as if they're
trapped in actress Sri Reddy's leaks?

1004
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,800
Yes, dude.

1005
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,360
Hey, where is the magician's house?

1006
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,840
Are you new to this place?

1007
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,840
Which place?

1008
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,040
Tell...

1009
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,960
Hey,

1010
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,240
How'll he tell if you close
his mouth?

1011
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes, we are new to this place.

1012
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,480
Do you know that Bhattadhri's house?

1013
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,480
You aren't aware of that
Garudaraja Bhattadhri!

1014
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,120
He is an expert in
blackmagic and witchcraft.

1015
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,360
What did he have as side dish?
Lentil snack or dry fish pickle.

1016
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,080
Dude, don't talk to him.

1017
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,520
He might ask egg for credit.

1018
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,280
The great black magician,
Garudaraja Bhattadhri...

1019
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,160
Take your hands off.
No one will drink.

1020
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,920
Tell.

1021
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,640
Everyone is afraid of him.

1022
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,680
No one can sleep in peace,
if you oppose him.

1023
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,160
Why, will he snore lying
beside us?

1024
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,160
Stop praising him.

1025
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,520
Give us his address.

1026
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,280
Mukkanni graveyard.

1027
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:31,360
Now the great magician, great friend
of evil souls is going into trance.

1028
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,200
Soul of the
dead-demon-devil...

1029
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,800
Uncle, I've seen people
feeding dogs.

1030
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,960
But, here they feed the ghost.

1031
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,920
Dude, it's beetroot rice.

1032
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,440
I don't need side dish.
You eat.

1033
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,440
If the evil spirits create
any trouble here?

1034
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,680
Oh no! It stinks.

1035
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,240
It might be the food
mixed with blood.

1036
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,360
Take this and rinse your mouth.

1037
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,840
You all should not get panicked
or become afraid.

1038
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Who are you being drunk and
creating troubles here?

1039
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,720
My guru is 'Lord of the Lords'!

1040
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,920
Will you witness...?

1041
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,480
What are you blabbering?

1042
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,360
Did you see the lord?

1043
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,640
Hey sister,

1044
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,760
Even the kids won't get
afraid of this.

1045
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,560
Don't do these
gimmicks to me.

1046
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,080
Hey...

1047
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,760
- Everyone stay calm.
- If you touch my dude,

1048
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,960
I'll lynch you.

1049
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,040
Sister, I know he is
a big shot.

1050
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,320
It's the problem between
me and my father-in-law.

1051
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,160
It's the family issue.

1052
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,480
No one must interfere.

1053
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,480
Understood?

1054
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,680
Sister, If anyone interferes,

1055
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,600
They'll be thrashed.

1056
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,040
Uncle.

1057
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Uncle, relax.

1058
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,640
Uncle, relax.
See here for a minute.

1059
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,000
Uncle, Sorry.

1060
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
This should be discussed by
the elders. You come and talk.

1061
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,400
Not that, dude.

1062
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,200
I'm feeling hungry.
Give me that egg.

1063
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,480
Egg...Here it is.

1064
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,440
- Take it.
- Thanks.

1065
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,080
If we love the daughter of a cop,
they cuff us with police.

1066
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,080
If we love a politician's daughter,
they pound with henchmen.

1067
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,720
If we love a black magician's daughter,
you whip with ghost.

1068
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,400
How the world will survive without love?
What's this?

1069
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,640
I don't understand.
Tell me.

1070
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,480
Dude.

1071
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,600
- What happened, uncle?
- Stomach upset.

1072
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,800
It might because of
the black magic egg you had.

1073
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,840
I brought you here to talk with him,
thinking you're an elder.

1074
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,200
Go...
Hurry up.

1075
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:05,920
Come fast.

1076
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,880
If he accepts for engagement,
as an elder, you need to be here.

1077
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,040
- Go and hurry up.
- Don't get angry. I'll hurry up.

1078
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,320
Uncle, I'll tell you an information.

1079
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,120
- Your daughter...
- Dude.

1080
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,800
What's your problem?

1081
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,040
What about the water?

1082
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,960
Here it is, take that.

1083
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,520
Dude, I can't use this with one hand.

1084
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,160
- Take this.
- Okay dude.

1085
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,720
- Leave that.
- That is guru's dome water.

1086
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,200
- I need water urgently.
- It's very important.

1087
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,200
- Without water, how can I wash?
- Don't take that.

1088
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,560
This is some sacred water.

1089
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,680
Get the leftover for him.
That's not what I asked for.

1090
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,760
- Oh, my goddess, it's dome water.
- Leave me.

1091
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,880
- Something is going to happen.
- Relax, it'll come.

1092
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,880
- Uncle, get the leftover water.
- Okay, dude.

1093
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,400
Uncle, you must understand one thing.

1094
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,120
Is your daughter so beauteous
to whip me with ghost?

1095
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,800
Nothing like that.

1096
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,520
But, she'll do one thing.

1097
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,600
Uncle, she is an affectionate girl.
I fell for her.

1098
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:13,960
Your daughter's forehead
glows like a blue label bottle.

1099
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,800
Her eyes turns red.

1100
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,560
Her lips turns pale
when touched.

1101
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,920
Very chubby.

1102
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,400
She is cute, uncle.

1103
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,760
I'm an orphan.

1104
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,400
If you accept me to marry
your daughter...

1105
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,240
...I'll take care of her
in my heart.

1106
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,760
Uncle, open your eyes
and look at me

1107
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,360
Mic testing...
Uncle...

1108
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,080
Uncle...

1109
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,000
Uncle...

1110
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,080
Please, uncle.

1111
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,480
I won't go from here, uncle.

1112
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,360
Uncle...

1113
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,600
Uncle...

1114
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,440
Why have you dressed badly,
when ladies are around you?

1115
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,640
Dude, why are you lying on
his lap as a feeding baby?

1116
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,120
Uncle...have you come back?

1117
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,720
Have you spoke to him?

1118
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,160
Didn't he open
his eyes, still?

1119
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,400
No, uncle.

1120
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,400
He is sitting like
Lord Kubera's doll.

1121
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,560
Hey, toad...

1122
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,400
Go away.

1123
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,360
How long, uncle?

1124
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,320
He doesn't open either
his mouth or his eyes.

1125
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,240
Leave it, I'll take care.

1126
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,560
In-law, behave like an elder.

1127
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,120
In-law, we have come down
to meet you.

1128
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,400
You've done and only talking.

1129
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,960
Keep quiet, dude,
Enough of making fun.

1130
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,840
In-law, tell us either you
like the groom or not.

1131
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,480
Uncle, he can't say
that he doesn't like.

1132
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,720
He ought to say
that he likes me.

1133
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,800
Though you whip me
with a ghost,

1134
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,880
I came to meet you, that's because of
my love on your daughter.

1135
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,360
So, stop all these and think of
a good name to your grandson.

1136
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,680
Shall I leave?

1137
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,720
Chanda...

1138
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,880
Uncle...

1139
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,640
Weapon.

1140
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,920
Dude.

1141
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,440
Dude, weapon.

1142
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,240
Come on...

1143
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,240
Stop!

1144
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,400
Can I ask you a question?

1145
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,960
Why did you push that
Panicker's workers?

1146
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,440
That is...

1147
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,040
The magical plaintiff's daughter,

1148
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,520
And my son-in-law are in love.

1149
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,840
That's why we came here.

1150
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,000
Hey, will it be Malayalam,
if you use that slang for tamil?

1151
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,520
It's enough for me
suffering in your amity.

1152
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,120
Just shut your trap.

1153
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,040
Brother, it's a love matter.

1154
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,800
Oh, is it love?

1155
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,600
Yes.

1156
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,880
See.

1157
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,360
No one from this place will help you
to go against the black magician.

1158
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,680
But, there is one.

1159
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,800
Brother, who is that?

1160
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,280
Kunjukuttan.

1161
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,200
Kunjukuttan.

1162
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,360
Where is he?

1163
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,080
You mean, where?

1164
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,280
He is here.

1165
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm that Kunjukuttan.

1166
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,560
What's the rationale to help us?

1167
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,000
There is a reason.

1168
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,080
Do you know what
happened between us?

1169
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,560
This is what happened.

1170
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,440
Mr. Kunju...

1171
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,080
Don't waste the time
asking what happened?

1172
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,680
They both are rivals.

1173
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,360
We'll use this opportunity
and stay with him.

1174
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,960
Brother, shall we...?

1175
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,880
Follow me.

1176
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,680
Come on.

1177
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,200
Kunju speaks english.

1178
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,800
Shangunae.

1179
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,400
Hey, Shangunae.

1180
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,280
Do arrangements for
the Pooja.

1181
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,960
Place blood and flesh
on one side,

1182
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,640
The other side with ashes
of corpse.

1183
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,080
Prepare it.

1184
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,640
Don't do that, dad.

1185
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,560
Please.

1186
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,400
Everything has crossed
the limits.

1187
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,720
I'm the 'King of Witch craft' of Kerala.

1188
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,440
I'll make the guy
who made fun of me...

1189
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,120
...to rove around
as a street dog.

1190
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,400
I swear on the goddess,
Badhrakali.

1191
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,880
Dad, you don't toil yourself.

1192
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,800
I'll tell them to
leave this place.

1193
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,160
Please, dad.

1194
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,240
What?

1195
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,400
Are you combing?

1196
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,880
Why do you make
fun of me?

1197
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,600
As the scalp is itchy,
I'm scratching.

1198
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,120
Kunju, what's the feud between
you and the magical plaintiff?

1199
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,600
- Feud?
- Yes.

1200
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,560
This is what happened.

1201
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,000
I'll never ask
about your flashback.

1202
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,640
I swear on you.

1203
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,680
Why did you come here?

1204
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,680
I came to buy banana chips
as it's of low cost.

1205
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,120
Okay, I only told you
to propose me again.

1206
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,400
For that?
Will you come to my place?

1207
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,680
Viji.

1208
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,520
I'm feared, my dad might
do something.

1209
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,080
Go away from here, Viji.
Please.

1210
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,480
Tell that you don't like me
and not in love.

1211
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,160
I'll leave now.

1212
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,440
Tell me.

1213
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,120
I don't like you.

1214
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,760
Are you telling me
to leave or not?

1215
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,320
I don't know.

1216
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,160
Are you confused?

1217
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,600
This girl from Kerala
has fallen in love.

1218
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,680
Switch off the song.

1219
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,760
You play a song as soon as
the love onset.

1220
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,440
Think of what to do next.

1221
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,440
Brother, there is a balm
for headache.

1222
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,320
- A good for a bad.
- Okay.

1223
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,240
Similarly, there must be
someone to oppose him.

1224
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,000
Yes, only one person.

1225
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,720
Hey, won't you tell
when you put the brake?

1226
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,480
Chakra Mahadevi!

1227
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,680
(Devotional song)

1228
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,440
Tap on.

1229
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,160
(Song from 'Velipadinte Pusthakam')

1230
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,840
Hey, uncle.

1231
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,080
What's that you do,
as if she performs a street dance?

1232
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,200
I thought it's
'Jimikki kammal' song.

1233
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,480
Song?

1234
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,960
Hey, what do you say?

1235
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,480
Hey egghead, is she
dancing for 'Jimkki kammal'?

1236
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,680
Do you know,  who is she?

1237
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,520
Parasakthi!

1238
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,200
What's the matter?

1239
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,640
She is my cousin,
who got many proposals.

1240
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,880
Nothing worked out.
You must give us a solution.

1241
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,480
Devi!

1242
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,400
Touch this coconut and pray
for your heart's desires.

1243
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,200
You got a flower

1244
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,640
Within forty one days,
your desire will happen.

1245
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,240
Are you happy?

1246
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,880
Oh no, what's this?

1247
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,560
Rudram.

1248
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,600
It means your time is not good.

1249
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,440
What to do for remedy?

1250
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,880
(Blessing)

1251
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,160
Ma...

1252
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,600
Ma...

1253
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,360
- God will bless you.
- Ma...

1254
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
Fall at her feet, egghead.

1255
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,440
Pray...

1256
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,760
Bless you.
What's your problem?

1257
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,320
I'm Kunju.

1258
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,000
He is...

1259
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,440
I know.

1260
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,760
You have come from Tamil Nadu.

1261
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Your name starts with 'V'.

1262
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,080
Your girlfriend name begins
with a letter 'M'.

1263
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:04,920
Am I right?

1264
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,200
She is the daughter of
Garudaraja Bhattadhri.

1265
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,840
There is a hindrance
in the marriage.

1266
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,640
Goddess, Lalithambika!

1267
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,800
Come near.

1268
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,200
My mother's blessings
will be with you.

1269
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,920
You must attend the
Sri chakra Pooja tonight.

1270
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,680
Okay.

1271
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,240
(Chanting verse)

1272
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,520
You can leave.

1273
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,200
Viji has gone to that
Chakra Mahadevi's place.

1274
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,280
Dude, the hermitage itself is in furore.

1275
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,720
Did the poet Vairamuthu
has said anything?

1276
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,280
Is there any special pooja today?

1277
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,920
The plaintiff comes here.

1278
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,480
So only these arrangements are going on.

1279
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,480
See, by knowing she is doing
favour for us...

1280
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,440
...the black magician is
coming here to spoil it.

1281
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,640
What to do?

1282
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,840
Let him come.

1283
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,280
A climax awaits him.

1284
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,720
Hey, come here.

1285
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,160
Why do they close the doors like
it's going to be their first night?

1286
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,360
Both Mahasakthis will can join

1287
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,520
A cataclysm will occur here.

1288
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,720
If you are sneaky,
then I'm stealthy.

1289
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,760
If you are stealthy,
then I'm crooked.

1290
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,920
Hey, it's enough.

1291
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,040
First, think what to do
with that guy.

1292
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,360
What is happening?

1293
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,600
He has come to you,
in order to toss out me.

1294
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,560
If I chant mantra
and weed out you,

1295
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,480
He'll go away in fear.

1296
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,120
Hey,

1297
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,360
Are you going to finish me
by chanting mantra?

1298
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,520
Just an acting.

1299
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,200
Can't you do this for
sake of my daughter?

1300
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,480
I'll do for you.

1301
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,400
How will I be benefited?

1302
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,080
Will you give me your
rubber plantation?

1303
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,760
What? Rubber plantation?

1304
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,560
He is thinking too much

1305
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,440
Will he give it?

1306
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,600
I'm okay with the deal.

1307
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,960
Call him, we'll start the drama.

1308
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,000
Okay.

1309
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,920
Done.

1310
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,800
Viji.

1311
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,960
Come here.

1312
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,360
Jai jai Chakra Mahadevi.

1313
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,680
Mangalam Bhavathu.

1314
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,800
Why sir is grazing the goat
inside the hermitage?

1315
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,960
Don't say that way.

1316
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,840
No. You don't know.

1317
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,360
If I say 'I love you',
he'll whip me with the ghost.

1318
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,120
Sir, don't act.

1319
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,360
If I tell my love now...

1320
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,000
...will you whip me
with the ghost?

1321
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,880
Hello darling,

1322
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,600
Why did you call me, now?

1323
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,360
My dad may see.

1324
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,440
He is watching.

1325
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,160
He has a big face,
only half will be visible.

1326
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,000
See him now.

1327
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,320
Oh no, dad.

1328
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,920
Viji, what are you doing?

1329
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,320
Now, I'm going to propose
you before him.

1330
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,600
Oh no...please don't do that.

1331
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,800
I love you

1332
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,520
What?

1333
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,800
It's not me.

1334
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,240
Hey, boy.

1335
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:03,960
Oh, god.

1336
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,960
Don't be a bait
for my anger.

1337
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,760
Bhattadhri, you can't
harm him ahead of me.

1338
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,640
Did you witness the power
of our Rajamadha?

1339
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,760
Do whatever you want.

1340
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,120
Please Viji...don't say.

1341
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,960
I love you, Maya...

1342
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Don't get frightened.

1343
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm unable to understand
what's happening?

1344
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:50,040
'If you dote this virgin,
you're destined to die.'

1345
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,480
Stop there.

1346
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,080
Forgive us, Guruji.

1347
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,680
You made business practicing the
'Malayalam black magic'

1348
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,680
Betrayals of guru!

1349
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,680
Get lost.

1350
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,640
Guru, his only daughter,
is in danger.

1351
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,720
Save us! save us!

1352
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,600
You have to safeguard, Guruji.

1353
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,800
Don't punish us and
my daughter,

1354
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,960
Please, safeguard us, Guruji.

1355
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,720
Okay,
Tell me, what's the problem.

1356
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:47,560
The priests at present aren't
aware of this black magic.

1357
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,800
Because, my ancestral
gurus had said...

1358
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,880
it learning from the
'Atharvana Veda.'

1359
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,280
She is 'Yatchi Maya'.

1360
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,760
Do you know about her?

1361
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,280
No, guruji.
Don't know.

1362
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,840
At the end of 18th century...

1363
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,120
...George Williams, a lust fellow,

1364
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,800
I Love you

1365
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,040
The words he used to
seduce was, 'I love you'

1366
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,440
He spoiled the lives of
many women by these words.

1367
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,960
Once, George Williams
came to Kerala in a transfer.

1368
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:29,280
His lustful thoughts fell on
the beauteous Devyani.

1369
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,400
But he is not aware,
that she is the daughter of...

1370
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,440
...the 'King of black magic,
Marthanda Varma'.

1371
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,960
He had the administration
power and strength...

1372
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
...so he can't go against Williams.

1373
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,880
Citing this, he decided to
kill by black magic.

1374
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:58,840
He took the most dangerous
palm script, secured by his ancestors.

1375
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,440
On a full moon day,
Marthanda Varma started...

1376
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,640
...the pooja as noted
in the palm script.

1377
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,600
Welcome...
Welcome, Yatchi!

1378
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,080
If anyone comes close to
my daughter with love and lust,

1379
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
They must be smashed.

1380
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:23,680
He ordered Yatchi and seduced her.
and made her to safeguard his daughter.

1381
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,880
Hi, Devyani

1382
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,840
I love you.

1383
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,280
The moment he said that,
Yatchi appeared and smashed him.

1384
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,560
After throwing him out of the country,

1385
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,840
He stuffed Yatchi in a statue...

1386
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,880
...and buried it in a corner
of his house.

1387
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,880
Guruji, a similar Yatchi
is in my house.

1388
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,840
Still it's been active.

1389
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,640
How did you get this
Yatchi in your house?

1390
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,960
A middleman called me
to perform pooja in a old bungalow.

1391
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Look out for any evil forces.

1392
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,000
It's here.

1393
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,800
Some evil force is here.

1394
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,280
To get rid of that, four plates must
be buried in four directions.

1395
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,240
Luck favoured us.

1396
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,000
I was happy of finding
out a treasure.

1397
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,080
But, it's a novelty!

1398
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,720
A nail in that too.

1399
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,440
The moment you took
the nail on the Yatchi...

1400
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,280
...the spirit took possession
of your daughter.

1401
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,200
Is all these your work?

1402
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,120
Swamy, it's problematic only
if that is in house.

1403
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,240
What if thrown away
into the sea?

1404
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,720
Why gururji?

1405
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,640
Even if you throw into the sea,
or burnt in fire,

1406
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,080
That devil won't leave
your daughter on the whole.

1407
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,640
You must perform a 'Yagna',
where it is glorified.

1408
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,160
For that, a bachelor is needed.

1409
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:34,120
He must agree to whatever happens.

1410
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,520
He is leaving to his place.

1411
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,320
I said enough.
he is not listening.

1412
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,560
May all auspicious shower on you.

1413
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,880
Viji, are you afraid?
I'm here for you.

1414
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,800
Get lost

1415
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,680
You have cheated him
asking for money.

1416
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,200
- Uncle, to her...
- Wait, dude.

1417
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,320
What you think is right.

1418
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:07,800
Dharma may be seen losing
but finally, dharma triumphs.

1419
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,120
Look there.

1420
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,120
Seen him?

1421
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,840
That evil force, coerced him
to ask for forgiveness...

1422
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:18,680
...and marry his daughter to you.

1423
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,440
No, dude.

1424
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,720
Don't ever believe
that he has renounced.

1425
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,480
No...

1426
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,480
Come, let's go.

1427
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,600
- Wait.
- Bag...bag...

1428
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,440
Wait.

1429
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,680
He takes his bag often.

1430
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,720
- Come, let's go.
- Viji

1431
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,720
Come, let's go.

1432
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,240
- Viji, don't go.
- She is speaking. Listen to her.

1433
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,480
Viji, please.

1434
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,760
Get your daughter married
to an evil force.

1435
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,680
You've to caress with the skull
not with the child.

1436
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,760
Go away.

1437
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:41,720
Come, let's go, dear.

1438
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,160
- Don't listen to anyone.
- Viji, please stay.

1439
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,520
Listen only what I say,
understood?

1440
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,000
Viji...

1441
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,840
Dude, no.

1442
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,680
Love is blind.

1443
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,720
I...

1444
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,760
Viji...

1445
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,440
No!

1446
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,360
Don't say that!

1447
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,600
Everything is after the Yagna.

1448
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,560
You mean, Yagna?

1449
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,320
Yes, Viji.

1450
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,200
The Yatchi, is acting against me.

1451
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,360
To subdue that,
the one who marry her...

1452
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,840
...must perform a ritual.

1453
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,360
Yes

1454
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,560
They're a cheating clan.

1455
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,800
How come his ghost
oppose him?

1456
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,840
A good question, egghead.

1457
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,800
Let it be, reply me.

1458
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,760
- Have you seen the film, Robot?
- Yes, I've

1459
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,680
Didn't the robot created
by Rajinikanth, finally oppose him?

1460
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,720
Hey, oh!
That's logic!

1461
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,880
Yes, it's the logic.

1462
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,400
- Yes.
- Correct

1463
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,160
When, where and how
I must do the ritual?

1464
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,400
Viji, the gate opens
on its own!

1465
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,320
Hey egghead, see well.

1466
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,880
That half pint is
opening the gate.

1467
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,760
Leave the vehicle inside.
I'll close the gate and come.

1468
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,760
Yes.

1469
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,360
You'll panic others,
at once said as ghost house.

1470
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,400
This is the place where
Yatchi is glorified.

1471
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,600
Uncle...

1472
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,600
It's good to be a ghost
instead of being poor.

1473
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,680
All the ghosts reside
in bungalows, isn't it?

1474
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,760
Yes, dude.

1475
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,080
I wish to be born as
ghost in next birth.

1476
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,960
What about now?
Are you looking like a hero?

1477
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,840
You're like a ghost.

1478
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,200
You better stay here.

1479
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,840
Now, I'm going to perform,
Yatchi Samhara Pooja.

1480
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,120
The most important is
the palm script with mantras.

1481
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:09,160
Only, If you find that,
we can destroy the Yatchi.

1482
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,320
Guruji, won't that Yatchi
harm us, till then?

1483
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,560
It won't come near to you
till I complete the yagna.

1484
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,960
But, the other evil forces will hinder
you not to take the palm script.

1485
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,760
Be careful.

1486
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,360
They said as rituals
but now panic us...

1487
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,840
...saying as ghosts and demons.

1488
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,200
Why do you panic?

1489
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:28,760
The peak of black magic and
'The mountain of witch craft' is with us.

1490
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,520
Swamy, you start the pooja.

1491
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,360
We'll search for the palm script.

1492
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,760
Let all be good.

1493
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,080
Hey...

1494
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,880
Don't leave me.

1495
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,520
Are you going for
construction work?

1496
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,000
You accompany him
and search out.

1497
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,200
Go up and search.

1498
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,680
We'll search inside.

1499
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,040
I'll take care.

1500
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,520
Oh no, a bandicoot.

1501
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,640
I've come.

1502
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,440
It's very dark.

1503
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,400
- What happened?
- Don't be afraid.

1504
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,640
Why must I panic
when you're with me?

1505
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,960
I'm not afraid.

1506
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,320
Why are the doors closing?

1507
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,960
Hey, It's good to be a ghost
after death...

1508
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,520
...and taking the offerings on
new moon day as a crow.

1509
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,200
What attitude is this?

1510
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,720
If I nail down all the doors
with help of carpenter...

1511
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,800
...then you can't panic anyone.

1512
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,200
You'll be ashamed.

1513
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,480
I will get ashamed

1514
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,640
Then what, ma?

1515
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,200
Don't you have respect on us?

1516
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,760
See, the respect shown now.

1517
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,720
Have you noted the respect
after snubbing.

1518
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,640
Hey, you must've that respect.

1519
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,240
Ma, you be seated.

1520
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,320
Won't you swallow even
if numerous ghosts arrive?

1521
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,440
They don't know your power.

1522
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,640
Guruji

1523
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,440
Oh no, it's disrespect.
You get up.

1524
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,520
What are you playing
with so disrespectfully?

1525
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,960
Viji, I don't want any respect.

1526
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,920
We have come for
an important matter.

1527
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,320
Oh no! You touched Mahadevi!

1528
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,080
See what happens now.

1529
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,000
He is teasing the ghost and in turn,
it might tear me apart.

1530
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,720
Viji, don't go alone
you'll be afraid

1531
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,120
Guruji

1532
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,680
If you get it,
stuff in a bottle...

1533
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,080
...I'll keep it on the TV.

1534
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,520
He too...

1535
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,600
Guruji, isn't there something?

1536
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,080
Just for fun.

1537
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,120
Hey, goof...

1538
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,560
You're playing unusual.

1539
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,640
Why should I fear?
when Guruji is here.

1540
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,520
Why should I fear?
when Guruji is here.

1541
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,640
Are you mad?

1542
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,960
Don't you know when to play?

1543
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,480
I'm not afraid.

1544
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,160
(Chanting mantras)

1545
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,360
Viji, it won't be in this room.

1546
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,400
Ma, it's not in this room.

1547
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,600
That's what I too said.

1548
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,360
Let's go down. Come.

1549
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,240
Come...

1550
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,520
We'll search in some other place.
Come.

1551
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,840
Oh, escaped.

1552
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,680
Viji, what are you doing?

1553
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,200
There is a saying, if dog barks,
ghost will go away.

1554
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,800
See, It's gone...

1555
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,160
Listen here.

1556
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,760
We shouldn't play
with the invisible souls.

1557
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,680
Always the time
won't be favour.

1558
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,960
Do you know what happens
if it gets angry?

1559
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,360
Hold me.

1560
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,640
What sister,
you're flying like a balloon?

1561
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,000
Chant the mantra.

1562
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,480
I'm in tailspin,
You ask me to chant now.

1563
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,760
Pull me down.

1564
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,280
It's highly twirling!

1565
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,360
Jai mahishasuramarthini!

1566
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,680
Jai mahishasuramarthini!

1567
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,920
Jai mahishasuramarthini!

1568
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,880
Enough of it.

1569
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:48,960
Oh, my hand.

1570
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,280
You've become a mop head,
still you cheat me.

1571
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,360
Oh, my hand.

1572
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,640
Look Viji...

1573
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,000
Hey, change the modulation
and speak normal.

1574
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,400
Oh God!

1575
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,680
Greed of money,
I do this job.

1576
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,840
But, intend to save her,
I came along with you.

1577
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,400
If you're fake,
then what about Bhattadhri?

1578
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,560
He too is fake.

1579
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,680
What's the stance
of my uncle?

1580
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,360
Guruji

1581
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,000
Where did you go?

1582
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,600
You made me to tailspin
like a goat.

1583
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,160
Come...

1584
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,200
You are thrashing
the same person.

1585
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,960
Thrash the one who is
hiding there.

1586
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,960
Leave me.

1587
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,920
Leave me.

1588
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,400
Hey, bandicoot.

1589
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,800
I'm escaped.

1590
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,480
Is the bandicoot gone?

1591
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:02,840
It's me! not the ghost.
get me down.

1592
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,720
(Chanting mantras)

1593
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,760
I know everything.

1594
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,680
You're a cheating fellow.

1595
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,160
Sir, what do you do?

1596
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,040
Come, there is a ghost.

1597
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,800
It's no ghost. It's demon.
It's well known to us.

1598
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,440
Come.

1599
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,520
Come and see.

1600
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,160
Is he?

1601
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,080
If I haven't come,
both of you might look...

1602
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,440
-...through the door till dawn.
- Yes.

1603
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,480
Why did you sent me
along with him?

1604
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,720
He is panic stricken,
when looking at ghost.

1605
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,760
Better, you would've
sent me along with sister.

1606
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,600
If gone with her,
you would've flee.

1607
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,200
Is she also a fake?

1608
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,680
Yes, both of them are fake.

1609
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,400
Bandicoot.

1610
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,080
Oh, no!

1611
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,120
When everyone is feared of ghost,
Instead, he fears of bandicoot.

1612
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,680
See, it's of no use
to believe them.

1613
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,640
Let's search alone.

1614
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,280
Come.

1615
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,600
Come?

1616
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,880
They are big wigs.

1617
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,520
Who? They?

1618
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,040
She is a fake queen
and he is a fake top brass.

1619
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,160
You provoke me
to yell at them.

1620
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,120
You are damn cheap.

1621
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,160
Come.

1622
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,000
It's a shame.

1623
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,040
We must do something.

1624
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,360
Wait.

1625
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,080
I have an idea.

1626
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,320
Don't turn.

1627
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,840
It's confirmed,
there is a ghost.

1628
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,600
What to do now?

1629
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,080
How will you go
if you see a creditor?

1630
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,120
I'll go with my face closed.

1631
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,520
Uncle.

1632
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,680
You search in this room.

1633
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,400
- I'll go this side.
- Okay.

1634
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,280
Is it conjuring ghost?

1635
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,400
Dude's idea is right.

1636
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,120
I shouldn't turn.

1637
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,600
Hey egghead

1638
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,960
Hey...

1639
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,600
Hey, the ghost!
A ghost is there!

1640
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,880
Hey, listen to me.

1641
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,840
A ghost is there!

1642
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,320
He didn't listen to me.
Goof...

1643
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,920
(Chanting of mantras)

1644
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,400
- Who?
- It's me.

1645
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,040
You afraid of your voice
than the ghost.

1646
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,360
What are you doing instead
searching for palm script?

1647
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,080
Come.

1648
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,280
Don't go there.
There is a ghost.

1649
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,200
Nothing is seen.

1650
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,320
Not seen?
I'll show you.

1651
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,720
It's there!

1652
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,680
Seen?

1653
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,440
Not seen now.

1654
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,840
It's there now!

1655
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,800
Not seen now.
This is the problem.

1656
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,680
Hey loony, ghost is not here
after switching on the light.

1657
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,840
Why do you play
hide and seek still?

1658
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,480
- Go.
- Keep quiet.

1659
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,000
The ghost was here.

1660
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,240
- It was here only, might do something.
- Why are you searching now?

1661
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,760
Come and search for the palm script.

1662
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,520
My stomach got upset feared
of the ghost.

1663
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,240
Have to rest somewhere.

1664
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,480
We have to take the palm script by cheating
the ghost dressed up similar to it.

1665
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,600
Yes.

1666
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:14,240
How about my dressing?

1667
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,720
Feel like biting you.

1668
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,800
Hey, why do you panic me?

1669
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:17,920
Don't come close to me.
Go away.

1670
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,280
You go that way
and I'll go this way

1671
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,440
Go.

1672
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,360
My hands aren't wet.

1673
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,240
Then, how I cleaned up?

1674
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,960
Why do you come
like a thief?

1675
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,800
I'll yell at you filthy
in malayalam.

1676
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,800
Go, be normal.

1677
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,880
Go.

1678
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,360
He is dead.

1679
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,520
Who upturned it on my head?

1680
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,680
Leave my head.

1681
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,960
Leave me.

1682
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,720
The vessel stuck on my head.

1683
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,960
Someone help me, please.

1684
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,840
Who is that?

1685
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,600
Seems like Bhattadhri.

1686
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,920
Bhattadhri...

1687
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,160
Dude! Dude!

1688
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,440
Dude!

1689
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,840
Why are you shouting?

1690
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,760
Uncle, are they ghosts
or basketball players?

1691
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,520
Playing with us vigorously

1692
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:54,600
Kiss me, close your eyes

1693
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,680
And Miss me

1694
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,200
Close your eyes

1695
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,560
And kiss me

1696
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,800
Come on...come on...

1697
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,120
I'm coming.

1698
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,960
Kiss me...

1699
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,000
Close the eyes...

1700
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,960
Kiss me...

1701
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,240
Uncle!

1702
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,480
Be careful, uncle.

1703
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,520
Uncle, blood is oozing.

1704
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,880
Better you take rest.

1705
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,320
I'll search, uncle.

1706
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,280
Dude, what you say is right.
Go safe.

1707
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,000
- Will you take rest?
- I'll stay safe, dude.

1708
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:47,560
I'll hit you, haven't you taken booze
with me earlier for free?

1709
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,720
Come.

1710
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,240
Wish to sit idle.

1711
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,400
I have got a knife,
not bothered about the ghost.

1712
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,880
Like cutting a cake
why did you do this?

1713
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,760
- It's hurting, dude.
- Shall I leave, then?

1714
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,920
No...no...
take it slowly, dude.

1715
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,760
Hey, goof! what are you doing
stuck with a vessel?

1716
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,920
- Please take it out
- Bend now

1717
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,440
Turn and wait
Let me take it out

1718
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,120
Hang him upside down, dude.

1719
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,200
Lift his legs.

1720
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,280
Lift, dude.

1721
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,560
Get up.

1722
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,600
- What?
- Water.

1723
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,760
Water.

1724
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,880
No time for that.

1725
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,080
We have to search
for the palm script.

1726
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,040
Come.

1727
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,040
(Chanting mantras)

1728
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,440
I'm going to drink your blood.

1729
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,480
I'll be drinking...

1730
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,760
I'm not a ghost.
Leave me.

1731
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,040
You're falling here and there
and get hitting on your head.

1732
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,400
Get up...

1733
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,600
What's this?

1734
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,520
Your head is like a
white washed pot.

1735
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,000
I thought of cheating the ghost
dressed up similar to that.

1736
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,080
Can't you do anything
without cheating?

1737
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,880
You have a hefty body
even if the ghost...

1738
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,480
...chase, you can't run.

1739
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,600
Why do you do this job?

1740
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:19,280
Where is the fake queen?

1741
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,360
She is coming with me
and stares at me...

1742
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,880
A group of ghosts
together here...

1743
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,080
I'll manage.

1744
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:32,800
Dude, check whether it is?

1745
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,000
Viji, check whether it is?

1746
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,120
Viji, check whether it is?

1747
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,800
Don't confuse me
with fake materials.

1748
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,600
It's said as the palm script.

1749
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,000
It's like a notebook.
Search for it.

1750
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,160
Simply showing off
as if you're working.

1751
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,360
Don't hit me.

1752
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,680
Didn't take bath for
years together it seems.

1753
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,760
It's a haunting smell.

1754
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,000
Turn that side.

1755
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,920
Step forward.

1756
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,840
Oh, no! It intruded into the door.

1757
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,800
Will it expect me to come
in a similar way?

1758
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,080
We will become ghost after we dead

1759
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,360
Are they breathing after they became ghost?

1760
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,280
I'm coming

1761
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:16,680
Me?

1762
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,200
I will come

1763
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,920
They don't want entrance
then why do they need this fort?

1764
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,720
They can go and be in the forest

1765
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,960
I'll open the door and come

1766
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:34,000
That is...

1767
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,960
I died only two days ago.

1768
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,120
So, I'm yet to get the power of
intruding into the door.

1769
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:40,600
I'll get it in two or three days.

1770
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,240
Till then...

1771
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,640
Oh my ghosh! Save me...

1772
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,760
Hey come out.

1773
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,120
The bandicoot will hurt me,
if I come out.

1774
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,480
Be seated.

1775
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,240
(Chanting mantras)

1776
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,320
Welcome!

1777
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,880
The Yatchi who guarded this girl,
all these days...

1778
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,840
I welcome you.

1779
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,680
She is going to get marry.

1780
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:25,520
Leave her and go away.

1781
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,680
Swamy, you chant the mantras.

1782
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:42,120
(Chanting mantras)

1783
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,000
Swamy! Get up.

1784
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,960
The palm script...

1785
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,200
Get soon the palm script.

1786
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,960
Maya!

1787
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:16,120
Maya

1788
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,000
Dude, be careful.

1789
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:19,240
Maya!

1790
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,720
Maya!

1791
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,960
Maya!

1792
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,800
Maya!

1793
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:33,440
Stop.

1794
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,000
Maya!

1795
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,120
Maya!

1796
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,880
Maya!

1797
01:47:58,640 --> 01:47:59,920
Maya!

1798
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,560
Maya!

1799
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,360
Maya!

1800
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:17,960
Dude...

1801
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Uncle...

1802
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,440
Hey, uncle.

1803
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,880
Dude...

1804
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:31,680
Maya!

1805
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,920
Viji...

1806
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:41,960
Maya!

1807
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,840
(Chanting mantras)

1808
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,920
Maya!

1809
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,040
Maya!

1810
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,040
Dude...

1811
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,240
Come up

1812
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,000
Dude...

1813
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,840
Maya!

1814
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,360
Dude, be careful.

1815
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,640
You're watching as if
world cup match is going on.

1816
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,600
Throw us some rope.

1817
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,880
- Maya!
- I'll get now.

1818
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,320
Wait, I'll come.

1819
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,600
Maya!

1820
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,240
I can understand.

1821
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:33,840
Is it 'I love you'?

1822
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,720
I'm in tailspin stance.
Is it the time to propose?

1823
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,480
My hand is hurt.
Just help me to hold it.

1824
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,080
Why everyone is shocked
as if caught in 'Me too'?

1825
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,120
Why are you posing
like you're in washroom?

1826
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:59,200
Hey, how cleverly you made me
to love a ghost?

1827
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,800
Did you get caught by the ghost?

1828
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:02,920
You told that he is going to
meet his fiancee.

1829
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,080
Why are you silent now?

1830
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,440
Tell him...tell him...

1831
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:11,160
Hey, as you perform suddenly,
the co-stars can't react.

1832
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,760
See here,
still he is reacting wrongly.

1833
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,440
At last, what that black magician
has said?

1834
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:15,720
You're standing far.
Come close.

1835
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:16,720
Why dear?

1836
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,680
He told me to spit on your face.

1837
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,880
It's good to believe even the ghosts.

1838
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,120
But, shouldn't believe people
who are jealous like you.

1839
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:26,240
You planned to end my life,
but my life has got a beginning.
