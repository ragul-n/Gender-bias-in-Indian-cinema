3
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,625
Does that mean everyone’s life in this world is a drama?

4
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,166

However, few dramas will not be understood even by watching  
it

7
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,875
Nevertheless, few questions keep arising even Though you  
have answered them

8
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,791
Without our consent we would have enteredAs a character in  
someone’s drama

9
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,375

drama is completed

10

Not sure to trust what we hearOr what we see

11
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:22,875
Every drama has a start But this starts from the end

12
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,250
I am the character of this drama

13
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,208

16
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,375
But now he is sleeping

17
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,083
Assuming he would make a carrier out ofI gave him all the  
money I had

18
00:03:56,083 --> 00:04:01,625

time

 social welfare

00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,625
many times since childhood

150
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,125

00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,666
One is Kaali,

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,666
and the other is Thevla

154
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,250
The good part is,

155
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,958
These two are dumb compared to me

156
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,916
Raju give me 6 half tea

157
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,708
Idiots you are 3 members and

158
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,541
you require 6 half tea?

159
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,541
Don’t you feel ashamed as 
The balance is not cleared since 3 years

160
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:15,541
Are you not ashamed to ask the same from 3 years? 
Even though you know that we won’t clear balance

161
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,750
Even the scolding’s will be taken as 
Blessing by the lazy people like you

162
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,083
Cow dung it seems, 
Get lost Raju

163
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,375
He is asking for Balance?

164
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,416
Why do you act as if thereare ants in your shorts?

165
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,375
I have sugar pie in my short 
And that is why I act so

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,083
Why don’t you guys search for a job?  
Instead of wasting time like this!

167
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,791
Shut up and go

168
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,333
What makes you look sad Krishna?

169
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:47,916
Why?

170
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:53,750
My father keeps on blabbering the same 
Regarding the job and that is being a headache for me

171
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,666
We will do some work,

172
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,125
What do you mean by some work?

Keep quiet and sleep

183
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,083
Firstly work and get a salary,

184
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,166

185
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,000
This is what I do not like in you

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,125
What can I say for you?

187
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,500
Mom I will go to job and come

188
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,625
And also will get the salary and prove

189
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,750
Ok Son, be careful and don’t mind

190
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,500
regarding your dads words

191
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,291
Ok, I will take a leave

192
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,000
Ok son

193
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,750
Come buddy

194
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
Sir NamasteNamaste

195
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,916
Sir he is my friend Krishna

196
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:58,708
Namaste sir

197
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,958
He is the one who asked for a job?

198
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,041
Yes Sir

199
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,000
Look there!

200
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,458
Can you work now?

201
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,666
You seem to look educated

202
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,041
I don’t mind doing any work

203
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,041
Humans have made differentiation in caste and community

204
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,791
There is no need of differentiation in work

205
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,250
Will do any kind of work

206
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,791
I did not ask youWhether you know the work

207
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,125
Can you lift the luggage?

208
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,666
That is not a big challenge 
Will lift the luggage with ease

209
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,125
Ok then, go start the work 
Instead of standing here

210
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,125
Ok Sir

211
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,500
Will meet you in our place 
In the evening buddy

212
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,291
Ok buddy

213
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,708
What are you staring at?

214
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,416
Do you think the luggage will walk itself?

215
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,750
Remove the shirt and come

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,500
Ok

217
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,875
Fast..

218
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,416
Hey get up from there

219
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,625
I am not able to breathe as well

220
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,000
You are very lazy

221
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,708
I doubt that you would have criminal mind

222
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:52,708
Am I right Sir?

223
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,083
Why do you say so Sir?

224
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,041
While studying I thought education Is not important, 
so I dropped out

225
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,041
While working I thought bones are important,  
so I left the job

226
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,708
What else did you leave?

227
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,083
Left many of them Sir

228
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,500

232
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,416
Now he is doing lie job

233
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,708
I am telling the truth Sir

234
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,666
I doubt him Sir,

235
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,541
He is making us a scapegoat

236
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,916
Why does he not trust any of my words Sir?

237
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,958
After trying all these jobs

238
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,083
You came for the auto driving job?

239
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,541
Even that is an interesting story 
Let me tell you that

240
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,750
Sir you have been listening to His stories since he came  
here

241
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,625

00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,375
We are police and  
I am questioning him

244
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,125
What do you think? 
C’mon Sir

245
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,625
Shut up and go sit there

246
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,458

250
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,958

Go and sit

254
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,083
Not sure where they come from

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,291
Who are these people Sir?

256
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,125
What did I do?

257
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,125
Yes, you continue..

258
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,833
What happened next?

259
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,291
He would have stolen it Sir

260
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,083
We auto drivers are very trust worthy

261
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,791
If anyone leaves behind even 10 rupees

262
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,916
We will go give it back

263
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,625
Due to our problemsWe will  
ask for extra on meter charges

264
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,333
But you see us as thieves

265
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,916
We know how auto drivers play around

266
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,000
Leave that.

267
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,625
Tell me your story!

268
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:25,916

269
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:26,583
Tell me!

270
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,666
Me purchasing an auto is a big story Sir

271
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,000
He comes up with stories like this

272
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,458
He is not capable of doing even a single job

273
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,166
He is a such an idiot

274
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,041
He is changing 4 jobs in a month

275
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,125
Will he start ghee business for living?

276
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,041
Ask him

277
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,083
I will get the cows milked which  
you have got from Village

278
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,875
And will make butter milk and 
Then ghee from it for living

279
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,083
DAD..! I am not the guy,  
who sells it,

280
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,833
I am the one who eats it.

281
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:57,916
I saw so many people like you, who build building on air but 
 he leves at slum area

Will you both be quite?

284
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:06,083
The person who could not make an elephant 
Made his son an lord Ganesha

285
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,250
And left him in the house  
Assuming he is a tiger but to be a rat

286
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,750
You did not listen to my Grandfather 
And the son did not follow you

287
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
What do you mean?

288
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,083
Forceful dialogue!

289
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,625
He said something,

290
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,125
As he said,

291
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,250
It was a forceful dialogue

292
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,250

293
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,166

At this age we cannot settle in any job

00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,000
Cucumber!

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,500
He is not cucumber,

343
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,375
He is Bitter Gourd

344
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,625
You guys are making fun of me  
with the name of vegetables

345
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,875
You say as cucumber 
And you as Bitter Gourd!

346
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,416
Look at his ugly face

347
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,083
And the shades above his crooked nose

348
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,750
His beard, his clothes

349
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,500
He looks like a joker in the circus

350
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,333
An idiotic guy

351
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,375
Will you keep quite?c

Looking at him others will have gaze

358
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,208
You cannot be without insulting him is it?

359
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:50,166
My view is good and yours is not

360
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,458
My view is good and yours is not

361
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,125
Go and do some work

362
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,541
You keep saying that you have given birth

363
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,833
Do you think you have achieved something?

364
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,208
If you think so then go 
get an award for yourself

365

Stand stiff 
Sunil go get an award for you as well

366
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,625
Why do you say so Krishna?

367
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,041
You have given birth for two different shades

368
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:10,750
For that

369
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,500
I pray you get married soon and

370
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,750
Have at least four kids

371
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,875
You will get to know then how

372
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,500
difficult it is to clean the bum

373
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,958
You idiot, shut up and clean the bum!

374
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,166
You guys think giving birth to  
kids is a big achievement

375
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,458
What the kids do is called achievement

376
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:40,291
I am not sure why.....

377
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:45,541
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

378
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:50,875
I am not sure why

379
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:56,291
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

380
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,583
I looked awful

381
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,916
Have changed completely

382
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:05,833
I doubt whether  
I am handsome

383
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:11,916
Does she have a sight problem?

384
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,708
I am not sure why......

385
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:23,250
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

386
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,708
I am not sure why......

387
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:34,250
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

388
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,541
The helicopter in my heart

389
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,291
Is making very loud sound

390
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:05,708
The sky is rotating 360 degree

391
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,333
The moment that you looked at me

392
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:16,875
My heart had to take the love tablet

393
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,500
I assume to be the fish 
Swimming on dry land

394
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,208
I am not available for myself 
Not sure what happened to me

395
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,291
I wish to keep the focal point 
With a kiss from my lips

396
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:29,250
You should feel shy always

397
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:36,208
I am not sure why

398
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:41,416
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

399
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:46,791
I am not sure why

400
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:52,208
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

401
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:19,333
I looked at my portraitAt the mirror

402
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:24,833
My comb is also fed up of me

403
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:30,166
My eyes which was seeing something

404
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:34,958
Is waiting for you without any reason

405
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,708
I have lost the route to my house

406
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:40,541
With all my dreams, 
been waiting for you

407
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,333
I want to sleep on your lap

408
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:49,041
Seeing that the moon has to creep

409
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:56,958
I am not sure why

410
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:02,333
The beautiful girl smiled starring at me

411
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,208
I looked awful

412
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,916
Have changed completely

413
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:12,125
I doubt whether 
I am handsome

414
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:18,375
Does she have a sight problem?

415
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,875
How come Bangalore hasdeveloped 
 so fast and big guys?

416
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,583
People migrating from other states

417
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,083
Have come here and built a big bungalow

418
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,208
And have been riding expensive cars

419
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,833
We have been born and brought up here

420
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,250
But we have not achieved anything

421
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,125
If our grandfather was in good terms

422
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,666
I would be driving a Benz car now

423
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,791
Is it? How is that?

424
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:11,041
Surrounding 150 hectaresbelongs to my grandfather

425
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:11,750
Is it?

426
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,375
Have I not said this to you? 
No!

427
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,000
I had saidNo!  
You had not buddy

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,125
Haven’t  
I said this to you?

429
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,958
I had mentioned, remember it 
No buddy, you had not

430
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,500
If you want to say it, then say it 
Else shut up and come

431
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,041
You idiot, he is bluffing 
And you believe it like an innocent

432
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,291
Wait until I say it, 
Why do you get angry for that?

433
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,750
Will make the kid understand!

434
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,125
My grandfather had the craze for playing cards

435
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,958
With a single game he lost 100 hectares

436
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:33,833
What about rest 50 hectares?

437
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,750
I have been searching for the papers, 
But have not found yet

438
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,000
I have not found the 
Vidhana Soudha papers yet

439
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,375
Hey Gaali...yes

440
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,833
The surrounding place of your house

441
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,208
belongs to my grandfather.

442
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:47,166
Due to roaming around  
inbullet vehicle and donating to all

443
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,583
By donating! 
Did you eat?

444
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,875
Eat...! you idiots

445
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,958
Basically go and eat thrice a day

446
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,500
to achieve something in life

447
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,750
You idiots, forget about searching the papers

448
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,250
Basically go eat something

449
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:03,833
You idiot! Don’t you have eyes?

450
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,041
If you cannot ride an auto then why do you get it on road?

451
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,583
Go do ghee business instead of riding auto

452
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,666
Due to drivers like you the auto community  
has got a band name

453
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,125
I wish you guys ram into heavy vehicles and die

454
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,666
Riding and auto is also an art

455
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,583
There is an style and way to ride it

456
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,208
If you guys do not know that, 
Then take classes from me

457
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,583
Without knowing to ride, 
These stupid’s come on road

458
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,333
What are you guys staring at?

459
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,333
What is this Krishna?

460
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:28,958
What now?

461
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,583
Do you know to ride an auto?

462
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,041
Why do you ask in a vulgar way?

463
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,208
Mention clearly stating do you 
know to ride an auto and leave an auto

464
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,166
Yes, that is the one

465
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,875
You know to ride an auto is it?

466
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,708
Yes....

467
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:44,500
You have got the Driver card during 
The last election with counselor influence right?

468
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,208
Then why do you have to search for other job

469
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,375
Ride an auto....!

470
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,541
I to can ride an auto 
But who will provide Sir?

471
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,083
I searched for a week

472
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,458
As the trend is for cabs,  
I did not get any

473
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,416
Finally I decided to buy a used auto 
And asked for the money from my father

474
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,958
I will leave for office 
Take care of children and house

475
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,583
I will, you take care

476
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:04,750
Sunil!

477
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,958
You were enquiring about work,

478
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,583
Yes, Did you find any?

479
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:09,541
You will have to search

480
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,250
If you search then you will get one

481
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,458
Else you will be cleaning your 
Kid’s ass like this

482
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,541
Wearing an torn inner wear 
And making them drink milk.

483
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,416
Though he cannot make a living

484
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,625
He is a philosopher who can advice others!

485
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,666
I need some money dad

486
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,416
Can you let me know for what?

487
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,583
I have planned to buyan auto and ride it

488
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,041
If you give me money 
Then I will buy and used one

489
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,958
How much will it cost Krishna?

490
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,458
Around forty thousand mother

491
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,041
Forty thousand..?

492
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,875
Is forty thousand a small amount for you?

493
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,416
Where shall I borrow

494
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,583
forty thousand for him?

495
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,375
Let me put an end for you scolding meAnd me getting  
scolding’s from you

496
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,375
I am saying that I have decided to work,

497
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,208
If you arrange the moneyI will purchase an auto and will  
earn

499

Now he is saying that he will workWhy can’t you help him?

502
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,000
If I buy him an auto,

503
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,833
He will earn andtake care of the house and society

504
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:20,333
I get scolding’s If I don’t workAnd even if I say I will  
work

505
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,333
Should I not prosper in life?Not good

506
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,625

With lot of difficulties and hard workI am taking care of  
you

510
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,666
The reason for me to scold you isThat you would earn and  
make a living

Due to god’s grace you have decided toEarn and make a living 
 for yourself

Take this and buy a good auto

00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,250

Why do you jump into a running auto?

597
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,166
Go to Malleshwaram, it is quite urgent

598
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,291
I won’t come to Malleshwaram

599
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,500
Why don’t you come?Should I call police?

600
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,083
No need to call

601
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,041
Give fifty rupees extra on meter charge

602
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,000
Why should I give? Should I call?

603
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,083
Why do you keep saying so

604
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,375
as if you are born to it

605
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,458
Shut up and sit ok

606
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,375

00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,250

Felt like someone slapped me

616
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:53,375

You do not know the power of police

911
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,958
Do not try to get to know

912
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,583
Tell the truth what you did to him?

913
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,625

917
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,416
Make him sit here

918
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,166
Get up

919
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,458
Get up and stop buidling up stories.

920
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:39,333
Sit down,

921
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,708
Give him water

922
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:43,166
sit down

923
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:47,000
You look like a innocent guy

924
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:49,916
We will come to know whether you are telling the truth or  
not

925
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:52,625
You are not suppose to go any where without informing us

926
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,083
Have some water

927
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,625
Now you take leave from here

928
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,666
Whenever we need you must come here

929
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,666
Why sir ? what happened ?

930
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:14,833
Nothing

931
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,416
I am not able to understand

932
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,791
Something is suspicious here

933
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:22,208
More than the fact that he is telling the truth or lie

934
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,333
There is something which he is not aware of

935
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,041
Get into auto Rukku

936
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,125
Krishna,

937
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,541
What did police say?

938
01:16:56,875 --> 01:17:01,041
What else do they ask for?Do you know about those three  
missing persons?

939
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,625
Does that mean they got to know everything?

940
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,500
No they did not get to know anything

941
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:07,500
you dont worry

942
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,666
I have built up a story as such of an movie

943
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:16,416
I have told them there is ghost and spirit inside the auto

944
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:19,250
I think they believed my words

945
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,375
If they have not, again I will make them believe

946
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:29,333
What I had said to police was different and the real  
scenario is different

947
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,541
Rukku you seem to be tensed?

948
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,291
What happened ?

949
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:41,958
Nothing as such Krishna

950
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,666
Wont you let me know?Let me know?

951
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:51,125
I need an help from you Krishna!

952
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,500
Will do anything for you, let me know

953
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:56,791
Stop the auto here

954
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,083
Let me know what has to be done?

955
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:10,625
What happened Rukku?

956
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,708
why you are looking so ?

957
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:27,000
My friend Radha was molested by few goons!

958
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:29,375
We have filed a complaint in the police station

959
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,041
but they have failed to arrest them

960
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,291
Will you help me to find them?

961
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:38,208
We will search them

962
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,916
You seem very casual with your words

963
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:44,041
Rukku

964
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:45,416
Rukku

965
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:46,958
Rukku

966
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,791
Rukku what happend?

967
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,333
If the same thing had happen to me?

968
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:56,916
Would you have neglected this Krishna?

969
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,791
Would you have taken it so simple?

970
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,041
Would you have remained idle?

971
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,708
Why are you getting so angry Cool down!

972
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,875
Will search and handover them at policeget into auto, lets  
go

973
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:04,416
The hungry eagle is hunting with cruelty

974
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:12,250
The body is torn into pieces and eaten

975
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:20,000
Lion with lust has come up with the cruel face

976
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:27,916
All the ruins are destroyed

977
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:35,875
The hungry eagle is hunting with cruelty

978
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:44,291
The body is torn into pieces and eaten

979
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:15,958
The mirror seems to be happy looking at the face

980
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:23,875
Many dreams to be blossom remembering the smile

981
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:31,875
What will the flower expect which has lost selfrespect?

982
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:40,083
The dream that was dreamt was lost and disappeard in soil

983
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:47,750
Rukku what happen?

984
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,333
Rukku what you are doing?

985
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:51,500
What did you do to him?

986
01:21:57,916 --> 01:21:58,541
Hey buddy

987
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:03,375
He is dead!

988
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:07,208
You told we need to search andhandover them to police.

989
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:14,000
If we handover them to police, what would they do?

990
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:19,875
They will put them behind bars for few days and let them go

991
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:20,875
So?

992
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,458
Do you know how they murdered Radha?

993
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:24,833
What ! they murdered Radha?

994
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:27,958
Yes Krishna

995
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:34,666
They molested and murdered Radha!

996
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:43,541
Do you know how cruelly they tortured and killed her?

997
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:49,916
There was not even a single pieceof cloth remind on her  
body.

998
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:52,833
Her deadbody was in that condition

999
01:22:54,916 --> 01:23:02,375
To understand what pain she had gone through,You should see  
the cigerette marks on her body

1000
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:09,750
These Monsters did not spare her body even after her death!

1001
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:21,041
One after other like cruel wild animals

1002
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,041
I have seen that in my eyes and you have not

1003
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:39,625
Look at me shivering just by talking about that topic

1004
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:41,958
I am stummering

1005
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,875
Have you noticed ?

1006
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:53,458
Radha has suffered a lot of pain

1007
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:09,625
Hey Rukku

1008
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,875
She had beautiful dreams

1009
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:17,458
You know?She was in love

1010
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,166
She wanted to marry him

1011
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:27,625
Had an intension of leading an happy life with her Husband,  
kids in a small house.

1012
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:33,083
She had dreamt of spending her life with him till her last  
breath

1013
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,416
That dream of her has remainded as a dream

1014
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,208
Tell me Krishna!

1015
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:50,125
Shall we forgive them, without killing?Should we?

1016
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,041
More how many of them are remaining?

1017
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:18,333
Two of them!

1018
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:44,416
The clutter is in the middle of the wayI had to struggle to  
come in

1019
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:52,500
i am here to destroy the complicated you

1020
01:25:53,416 --> 01:26:08,791
You are in disguise mode and must be Punished for your guilt 
 and sin

1021
01:26:09,458 --> 01:26:24,875
When I am holding your breath These are the last days for  
your wicked mind

1022
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,583
Do you know why I had to lie so much?

1023
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,750
Rukku has to lead her life happily without being punished

1024
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:52,375
Stop the auto here Krishna!

1025
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:53,833
Why Rukku?

1026
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:55,416
Wait, will drop you to your home!

1027
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,583
No, I will go by walk from here You go home and take rest

1028
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,041
Okay

1029
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:10,375
Krishna we got some information about those three missing  
person’s

1030
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:20,666
They had involved in some illegal activities and gang wars

1031
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:28,291
We are suspecting those opposite gang Has involved in this  
matter.

1032
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:35,208
Had anyone followed your auto when they were travelling in  
your auto?

1033
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:45,875
I dont remember Sirand moreover I did not observe

1034
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:49,833
Murder case girl file

01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:19,416
Sir whose photo is this?

1036
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:23,583
The girl who was molested and killed recently.

1037
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:27,375
Her name is Radha

1038
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:40,791
Krishna you are the eye witness in this missing case

1039
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,750
We need your presence when we call you

1040
01:29:50,125 --> 01:30:17,500
(Recalling...)

1041
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:24,250
It is painfull to hear the word that you have left me?

1042
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:29,625
Let me know how should i believe it?

1043

01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:41,291
Will you come with me?

1045
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:52,541
If you go far away from me,Will keep searching you without  
fail!

1046
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,666
You're Rukku's friend Radha?

1047
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:10,583
Are you still alive?

1048
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,500
What are you saying ?

1049
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:15,750
Are you not dead?

1050
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:18,750
What are you saying.?Have you gone mad?

1051
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,458
Do not make me fool, am already confused

1052
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,458
Rukku said that you're dead!

1053
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,916
Who is Rukku?

1054
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:29,333
What you do not know Rukku?

1055
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,541
What are you saying?

1056
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,500
Everyone are trying to cinfuse me

1057
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:38,041
Rukku said that you are dead!But you are alive!

1058
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:43,833
The police is showing up Rukku's photo and are saying as  
Radha. Am totally gone mad!

1059
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:19,125
You are the one for me

1060
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:24,000
You are the real meaning for language of love

1061
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,000
Hey Rukku

1062
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:31,875
Hey RukkuWhen did you get inside the auto?

1063
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,125
What is going on here, am very confused Rukku

1064
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,875
Each one of them are saying differently

1065
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,666
You said Radha is dead!

1066
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:39,541
But she is still alive

1067
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,375
I happen to see her now

1068
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:44,291
She says that I am not Radha, my name is Ramya.

1069
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,916
I mentioned that Rukku said that you are dead

1070
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:47,708
In returnshe is asking me who is Rukku?

1071
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:50,875
The Police is showing up your photo and are claiming as a  
Radha

1072
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,166
They mentioned that you are dead!

1073
01:32:56,291 --> 01:33:00,416
I am very much disturbed and confusedNot sure what to do!

1074
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:07,583
Let us do one thing Rukku!

1075
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:11,166
Let us go to Police and will explain them,They will  
understand!

1076
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:17,041
Enough of all these lies, I will accept and surrenderI will  
take the punishment

1077
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,916
Rukku

1078
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:25,750
Not to worry,Do not accept that Radha is your friend

1079
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,958
I will take care of the rest!

1080
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:33,666
Krishna please calm down, Why are you so tensed? nothing has 
 happend.

1081
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:36,500
I will make you understand

1082
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,958
I need to tell you something

1083
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,333
I am not Rukku,

1084
01:33:48,125 --> 01:33:48,625
Radha!

1085
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:58,291
Rukku what you are saying?

1086
01:33:59,041 --> 01:33:59,916
Yes Krishna,

1087
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:01,666
I am Radha!

1088
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:11,708
Do you remember that one day an auto collides with you while 
 you were walking on the road

1089
01:34:17,416 --> 01:34:19,083
I was in that auto at that moment

1090
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:25,708
The auto collided with you while they where kidnapping me

1091
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:27,708
Krishna

1092
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:32,125
That auto is none other than this auto

1093
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:35,375
They forcefully closed my mouth

1094
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:38,416
With lot of difficulty I shouted your name

1095
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:40,041
Krishna

1096
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:46,750
But you did not heard my shout

1097
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:55,208
If you had heard my shout, we both would have been together.

1098
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,708
Our dreams would have come true

1099
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:30,208
I need to tell you something,before that you have to say one 
 thing

1100
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,708
Do you like me?

1101
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,541
Even I like you so much,

1102
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:48,750
I tried to inform this to you on many occassion,But I  
couldnt

1103
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:55,625
I am saying it now,I like you very much

1104
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,916
Do you know what my dream was?

1105
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,166
To get married to you

1106
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,916
Live in a small home

1107
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:08,666
you me and our kid we all together to make small family

1108
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,875
Live happily until our last breath

1109
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:16,041
On the same happy moment

1110
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:22,958
I want to hold your hand till my last breathe

1111
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:29,083
But all my dream has remained as dream

1112
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:33,541
Not to worry Krishna

1113
01:36:34,833 --> 01:36:38,500
If we have another birth we will meet up

1114
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,041
Let us love and get together

1115
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:04,000
I lied and fought hard to save her

1116
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
My Rukku is no more with me!

1117
01:41:08,333 --> 01:41:11,416
I had to script a drama to save my Rukku

1118
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:18,333
I had imagined I am the script writer of that drama,But  
without my knowledge I had become the role play.

1119
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:22,083
Though Rukku was not there,It was like she was always there  
for me

1120
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:26,458
When I feel like she is there with me,But she is not seem to 
 be there

1121
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:28,333
I cannot survive without her!

1122
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:34,791
I will get together my Rukku even at the cost of my rebirth
