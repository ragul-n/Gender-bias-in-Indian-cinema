Massagerfunction, mini fridge,
and night vision assistance...

9
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,605
Solar sun roof and
number of other features

10
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,840
So it doesn't have an AC?

11
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,783
- Excuse me sir
- l asked about AC

12
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,878
Will the company give or
should l pay extra and get one?

13
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,888
Sir This is an international car standard

14
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,793
lt will come with AC of
international standard

15
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,727
Asking if the car has AC is like...

16
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,628
...asking if the car has tyres?

17
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,136
But this colour
will not like my wife

18
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,678
We have options for colour

So...l should have been finalised tomorrow
Come with my wife

23
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,699
Ranjith VB, Janaki Tailors

24
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,647
lndia is developing

25
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,111
1221784336

26
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,214
No

27
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,394
Let me see l if l get
at least the 8th prize?

28
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,859
l have lost the money spent forticket

29
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,174
The Kerala state will never progress

30
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,242
What brother

31
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,210
Did you not get
a lottery prize this time too?

32
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,373
lt was Kerala Karunya Bumper ticket

33
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,143
Poor people in that state
benefit by this lottery

34
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,809
l purchased it only on that idea

35
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,081
Lottery ticket sales
are banned in Tamilnadu

36
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,713
l bought this ticket in black market

37
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,791
ls it?

38
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,360
- Do you know Muthu
- What is it?

39
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,222
l know a business which would
earn more than this bumper prize

40
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,835
- Then why don't you do that business?
- l don't have money to do that business

41
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,437
lf you have money,
why should you do business?

42
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,900
Eat sumptuously, spend lavishly,
watch a Vijay movie and live peacefully

43
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,642
First of all you don't know
what economics thing is happening

44
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,007
Because you don't know that
You will not comprehend

45
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,245
- Brother
- No point in talking to you

46
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,843
Brother l have something to say

47
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,118
For 5 years the leftists rule
Next 5 years the rightists rule

48
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,956
These 2 parties rule alternatively
What progress did the state witness there

49
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,019
Whom are you talking about?

50
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,792
l am talking about
the 'Gods own country'

51
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,767
There would be at least
one hartal every month

52
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,396
Transport strike, power cut,
Endosulfan issue...

53
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,269
...and now it is Mullaiperiyar

54
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,233
ls there a state without issues?

55
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,311
ln Delhi it is outrage
ln Kashmir it is terrorism

56
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,211
ln Bombay it is the underworld
ln Bihar it is Naxalites

57
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,876
But they are not
ordinary people's problem

58
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,443
What are the problems of an ordinary man?

59
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,246
Development of basic amenities

60
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,382
Let them learn it form Tamilnadu

61
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,790
Lots of over bridges...

62
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:13,923
When you finish saying the word 'metro'
it is there, lT park, Textile park

63
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:19,227
ln between like coconut shreds for puttu
2 G spectrum, land grabbing

64
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,807
That is for a fun in between

65
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,239
Though they accrue personal benefits
their politicians take care of the public

66
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,174
How about our place

67
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,837
Neitherthey eat or allow us to eat

68
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,108
Because we are here long
since we are all safe

69
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,153
You are right
l came here looking for a job

70
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,416
Now l am the owner
of this first class 5 star hotel

71
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,491
You came here to become a star

72
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,454
You have become a first class tailor

73
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,155
Do you consider this safe?

74
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,200
l was doing small roles in films
and an olive branch was in sight

75
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,257
At that time...

76
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,532
...those two brothers took the entire
Malayalam film industry to our place

77
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,105
Because one guy is from Kochi
half the shoots are done at Kochi

78
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,267
The other brother is from Trivandrum

79
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,173
So the other half of
the shoots are done there

80
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,305
When Nazir sir left the scene
l felt my two wings were clipped

81
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,781
Anyway it was good time for Malayalees

82
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,318
Yes

83
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,889
Else if you had become an hero
Malayalees would've stopped watching films

84
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,427
One strong tea

85
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,325
But a day would come when
the same Malayalam film industry...

86
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,329
...would honour me with a golden shawl

87
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,826
ln Ambattur lndustrial Park
l'm starting a garments company in my name

88
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,029
l have obtained the sanction

89
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,538
What is the connection
between movies and dresses?

90
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,201
Do you know one thing Bhaskaran brother?

91
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,176
Many of today's big businessmen have all...

92
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,942
...walked through small steps
like this to reach the top

93
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,073
Similarly my venture garment company...

94
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,517
...would progress step by step
and transform to an Export-Import company

95
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,088
l would earn crores

96
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,487
Make my daughter
a heroine and produce a film

97
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,849
Afterwards it would be awards, Padmashree

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,894
Later it would be receptions, honours

99
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,261
- But your daughter is just 5 years old
- That will do

100
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,934
lt is all about films

101
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,402
By the time l make money,
my daughter would be 14 years old

102
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,372
Right age to become an heroine

103
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,573
Besides, present day superstar's show
interest to pair with heroines of that age

104
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,406
Your plans are good

105
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,150
But if you are planning to make a film,
keep your sewing machine safely

106
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,585
You may need it

107
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,393
-Are you a Malayali?
-Yes

108
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,898
Have you come to become an actor?

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,299
- No, for music direction
- That is much more promising

110
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,837
ln case you need a room orflat
l can arrange one for you

111
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,934
For the time being l am put up
with Assistant director Anwar

112
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,280
When l arrange for cash
l will let you know

113
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,445
Ranjit brother
There is a customer foryou

114
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,912
l am coming

115
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,587
Bhaskaran Brother

116
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,555
Regarding the garment company
l have to go out for sometime

117
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,284
l have to meet many officials

118
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,021
ln case someone inquires
ask them to call me on mobile phone

119
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:03,033
Those who take risks only prosper in life
Everything will become alright

120
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,860
- Go
- Let your words come true

121
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,405
You say you want to
wear this for a wedding

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:20,314
lnstead of altering this
why don't you stitch a new one?

123
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,153
What you say is right

124
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,882
But my husband has
suffered a loss in business

125
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,888
He has gone to Bombay looking for ajob

126
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,152
There is a money crunch

127
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,561
When there is a money crunch
the blouse should be loose...

128
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,194
...and not tight like this
Ok, l would keep it ready

129
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,000
- Come later
- Don't you want to measure me?

130
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,370
l know your measurements, go

131
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,037
l said l know your measurements
Come later

132
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,147
- Then shall l come tomorrow?.
- Come tomorrow

133
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,242
Bye

134
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,047
Dad and mom are not at home
No one to forbid us

135
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,019
Sumitra's hubby is jailed
for a cheque fraud case

136
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,493
Yes He cannot come out
unless he manages to get 6 to 7 lakhs

137
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,426
- ls it?
-Yes

138
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,555

139
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,725
My goodness
She is a...

140
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,328
What happened

141
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,736
- What is it?
- Looks like some problem there

142
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,099
Don't know what it is
Come, let's go

143
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,542
You stupid
You have dashed at me

144
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,075
My leg is hurt

145
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,540
ls there no one to question him?

146
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,381
My leg is gone
This guy has dashed me

147
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,113
lt is paining me

148
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,550
Move Move

149
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,386
Who the hell you think you are...

150
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,153
Are you blind?

151
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,625
Can't you see a car on the road?

152
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,322
Don't everthink you can blame me for this

153
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,364
You are a mad girl

154
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,693
Who let you out of your house?

155
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,166
l am asking you
Who let you out of your house?

156
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,429
Answer my question

157
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,602
l know what to do
l know what to do

158
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,604
Move

159
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,668
Hey man

160
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,137
This is lndia

161
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,681
Pedestrians get
the first priority on streets

162
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,645
Give respect and take respect

163
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,783
This is Chennai buddy

164
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,491
Brother The mistake is not on my part

165
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,457
l was driving at a slow speed

166
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:13,191
No, he is lying
He dashed and broke my leg

167
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,429
My leg

168
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,192
l swear, l am not lying

169
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,370
Brother Please stay quiet

170
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,770
Quiet please

171
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,132
Give Rs 2000 and settle it

172
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,472
Why should l?
l did not dash the car on her

173
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:29,139
Then make a Rs 1000 discount
and give her Rs 1000

174
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,512
Rs 1000

See, l am a doctor
Come, let's go to hospital

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,387
-Are you a Malayali?
- No...Yes

177
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,388
-You
-Yes

178
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,218
Don't want to go to hospital
They would inject

179
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,824
You give me money

180
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,331
- How will l walk with this leg...?
-Wait, l will tell you

You stay quiet

182
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,497
Give her Rs 500

183
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,337
She is enacting a scene
to make a livelihood

184
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,242
The rate would increase
if they mob you

185
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,549
- l give you Rs 500
-Why only Rs 500?

186
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,621
What is this madam?
He is giving you fondly

187
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,519
Get it
Get it from him

188
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,147
Come

189
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,088
Why all of you are crowding here?

190
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:13,750
Go Disperse

191
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:18,320
Madam Had you become an actress
you would bag the best actress award

192
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,729
Go All of you go

193
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,790
All of you move

194
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,563
lf something happens
all of you will crowd together

195
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,298
These people have no work to do

196
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,167
- Sir Are you a doctor?
-Yes

197
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:36,214
Sir When l turn my head like this
l hear a sound

198
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,406
-You mean this side
-Yes

199
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,676
Then turn this side

200
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,849
- How is it?
- lt is good sir

201
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,350
All these guys need
good thrashings

202
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,551
Not only in Kerala...

203
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,254
Even in Punjab, Gujarat, Orissa
why add more...

204
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,229
Even in Jammu and Kashmir's
Kupwara district our kids are there

205
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,766
They have come out
through these hands

206
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,300
Here the doctors hands are
the hands of God

207
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,306
We have undergone many
types of treatments at many places

208
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,468
Now we have come here

209
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,307
Finally you have
reached the right hands

210
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,615
lnfertility treatment requires
money and your time

211
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,346
Money is not an issue

212
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,514
We want to have a baby
That's it

213
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,591
All people who come here
have the same emotions

214
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,648
A mother's feelings

215
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,557
- Can l ask you something?
- Come on

216
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,532
Because it is expensive,
is it possible to get twins?

217
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,601
-You mean two birds for one shot?
-Yes

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,571
l can't assure you
That depends on the bird's time

219
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,765
You do one thing

220
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,140
Go to the counter, showthis slip
remit cash and get registered

221
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,678

- May l come in doctor?
-Yes

223
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,846
Anbumurthy

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,382
Wait there l will come there

225
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,781
My wife is pregnant

226
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,217
- ls it?
-Yes

227
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,943
Congratulations

228
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,189
- Same to you
-Why?

229
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,188
She became pregnant
because of yourtreatment

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,726
Did you mean that
Did l not tell you earlier...?

231
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,955
- Sit down
- Thank you

232
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,254
lt is a miracle

233
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,825
l told him to wait for some time
after the treatment, to see the results

234
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,268
He lost patience and one day
he went to the extent of hitting me

235
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,636
ls it not?
How do you feel now?.

236
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,607
lt is all your good luck

237
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,310
Nothing is in my hands
lt is all divine providence

238
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,448
You are absolutely right doctor

239
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,948
My wife went to a Godman's
ashram 3 months before...

240
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,311
Now she is 2 months pregnant

241
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:28,321
Along with your treatment and
the divine intervention the baby is ready

242
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,358
But you had problem
and not your wife

243
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,759
But that was cured by yourtreatment

244
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,198
Why do you confuse me?

245
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,599
Where can we meet this God man?

246
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,965
Do you want to join
the prayer meetings?

247
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,733
Don't want...

248
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,003
First get treatment
You go and remit the cash at the counter

249

Sit down

253
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,881

262

You could have bought there

271
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,856
Even though bit expensive

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,968

l told him not to go for it

282
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,628
Computer and internet are very dangerous

283
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,638
Children would be spoiled

284
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,510
Daily in newspapers, my god...

Can't you come for shoots?
Now your daughter is grown up

Though it is my earlier profession...

306

...now my hubby would not permit
me to act as a junior artist

307
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,562

Some times there will
be printing errors in paper

324
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,892
Lottery or loan,
one of them could help us

325
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,857
Lot ofjealous people around us

326

327
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,969

00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,273
Sir please
Sir

354
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,606
Look There is great demand forthis land

355
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,574
lf it is not you, it will be someone else

356
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,308
- l can't give you two week's time
- Sir please

357
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,786
Foryour sake, l can give one week's time

358
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,318
Ok

359
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,112
But you have to prepare
an important document for that

360
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,918
lt is a little risky job

361
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,094
Document
What is left out?

362
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,686
l have given all the papers

363
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,691
l mean that green paper
That is more important

364
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,913
Try to remit the cash
as quickly as possible

365
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,381
Else the land will not be yours
lt will be allotted to someone

366
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,796
Sir Give some alms

367
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,266
Granny M garment company
will be located here

368
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,861
- Pray for my well being
- Bless you

369
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:55,969
Bye

370
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,013
- Greet you sir
- Come sir

371
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,706
Couldn't see you for a month

372
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,840
You said you would come last week
What happened

373
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,147
Nothing l will get the loan after a week

374
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,416
Thereafter l would give
advance for machines

375
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,014
l came only to inform you about it

376
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,151
That's all ok
Dollar value is increasing

377
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,890
lf you order now,
l can give at this rate

378
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,828
Because the machines
have to come from Thailand

379
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,958
Sir Please don't tell me
the machine cost has gone up

380
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,797
l will not be able to
manage any escalation

381
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,306
Then do one thing
Pay 50 % and block the machines

382
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,740
The balance you pay at your convenience
and take delivery of machines

383
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,040
Please wait for one week, for my sake

384
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,204
Would block everything

385
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,714
l waited so long
Will l not wait for one more week?

386
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,810
- Come again
- Ok

387
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:53,162
Megha When you go inside
they would give chocolates

388
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,856
You should say 'No thanks '

389
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:57,999
Why?

390
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,067
Kids of big shots don't eat
anything given by strangers

391
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,799
- ls it?
-Ya

392
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,241
Wow lt is a new philosophy

393
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,174
Megha Ranjith

394
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,441
Come

395
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,453
-Are you a Malayali?
-Yes sir

396
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,121
Basically Malayali but
settled in Chennai sir

397
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,482
Your dress is very nice

398
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,159
-What is the colour?
- Pink

399
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,092
Very good, take it

400
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,903
- Can you sing a song?
-Yes ma'm

401
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,903
Then sing a terrific song

402
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:42,340
Why this kolaveri kolaveri di?

403
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:48,247
Why this kolaveri kolaveri di?

404
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,812
Distance ila moon moon

405
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,786
Moon colour white white

406
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:54,824
Stop it

407
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,923
Come

408
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,064
- She is selected
- But sir...

409
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,225
Wait That was not after
hearing the song

410
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,966
There was a question in the application...
What do you want your child to become...?

411
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,439
Others have written as doctor and engineer

412
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,104
But you have written you want her
to become a 'good person'

413
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,544
Yes That is the best answer

414
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,449
Education's goal is not to make
everyone doctors and engineers

415
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,349
They should grow as good individuals

416
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,281
You can proceed to the admission desk

417
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,360
- Great performance in the interview
- Brilliant girl

418
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,558
l neverthought you would be so
cerebral in filling up the application

419
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:43,567
There is a business man, an artist and
a singer with in this costume designer

420
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,974
Thejasmine...

421
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,510
No song now
Let us pay the fees now

422
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,413
lt is for Megha Ranjith

423
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,045
- Megha Ranjith
-Yes sir

424
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,120
- Total fee 1 lakh
-What?

425
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,389
- 1 lakh
-You mean 1 lakh?

426
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,261
Yes

427
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,632
They said it is Rs 50,000

428
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,198
50,000 tuition fee

429
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,636
Apart from that 50,000 one time
registration fee is also there

430
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,342
We didn't know about the registration fee

431
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,002
Not that, we were not informed

432
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,513
Don't worry
You can pay it in a week's time

433
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,914
Are you paying 50 now
or later you can pay full amount...

434
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,986
Take this

435
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,216
Take 50,000 now

436
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,450
- Balance we would pay later
- Ok madam

437
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,359
Have this

438
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,169
Had l known it is Rs 1 lakh
we could have gone for some other school

439
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,934
Why were you so haste in paying 50,000?

440
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,670
People are prepared to pay
lakhs to secure a seat here

441
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,046
Even the chief minister recommends

442
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,014
Why should we lose a chance that we get?

443
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:05,016
lf we had not paid this 50,000
they would give this seat to someone else

444
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,950
We have paid the advance
and blocked the seat

445
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,060
So even if there is some delay,
they would wait

446
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,665
But howto get balance
amount within a week?

447
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,127
What would we do?

448
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,067
lf there is no other go...

449
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,603
...we can pledge daughter's
chain and ear studs

450
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,576
Nothing doing
That can't be done

451
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,148
School going girls wearing gold is risky

452
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,443
l would not give

453
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,243
Don't cry my child

454
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:40,085
Even if we pledge both, for the remaining
l may have to find ways

455
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,351
Come, let us go

456
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,087
Come dear

457
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,160
Just 20 crores
l will take care

458
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,666
No problem
Documents?

459
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,440
l would get them ready

460
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,442
Don't worry
You come with the suitcase

461
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,207
Get the cash and go

462
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,316
Convey my inquiries to your leader

463
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,647
Ok Thank you
Shall l hang it?

464
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:13,017
Mr Ranjith, your loan will not be
passed in the nearfuture

465
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,157
Will it not be passed?

466
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,994
Sir At Ambattur lndustrial Estate...

467
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,564
...my garment company's
land has been sanctioned

468
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,131
l have not paid the advance

469
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,997
l managed to extent it till today

470
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,227
Everything was based on
the prospect of getting this loan

471
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,203
lf l don't pay within a week...

472
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,741
lt has to be sanctioned
by the Head Office

473
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,203
l am helpless

474
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,175
Bank should be convinced
your proposal is viable

475
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,781
Sir Please
You must trust me

476
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,343
l am confident that
my unit will be successful

477
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:45,650
How can l grant loan on
the basis of trust and emotions

478
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,725
Then what did you say over phone?

479
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,492
ls there no value for big money?

480
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,586
To get 10 lakhs
there are 10,000 roadblocks

481
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,023
lnstead of starting a tailoring shop
l should have entered politics

482
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,398
Ranjith Don't get upset

483
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,334
Sit down

484
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,171
There is a way out

485
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,597
l tell you this because
you are a fellow Malayali

486
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,471
There is a scheme for
Self Development of women

487
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,239
A maximum loan of 5 lakhs can be
obtained under this scheme

488
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,744
Give an application in your wife's name

489
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,515
l can speed it up in best possible ways

490
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,082
Ok sir

491
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,527

00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,767
lron this quickly

493
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,627
This is the heroine's costume
for a song sequence

494
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,036
Heroine's...

495
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,232
Before l get an abusive
call from the designer...

496
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,400
...this has to reach AVM

497
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,136

00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,718
This is a new fashion

531
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,762
This is called iron box cutting
Like this...

532
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,864
You don't teach me designing

533
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,226
This is not Hindi or Tamil movie

534
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,230
This film must reach family audience

535
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,395
But what you shoot it is an item dance

536
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,701
Shut up
What will l tell the heroine now?.

537
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,741
This iron box cutting...

538
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,777
What's the delay?
Where is the costume

539
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,779
- Costume...
- Show me

540
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,473
Madam Asmall mistake
Sorry

541
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:07,912
lt's really nice

542
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,782
lt is my latest isthiri cut design

543
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,484
lt's very peculiar cutting like this

544
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,660
- Ok Everybody go out
- Thank you very much

545
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,034
Walk fast man
The shoot has started, go

546
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,938
Did you bring the dress

547
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,442
Get the amount immediately
Producer may not give later

548
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,004
l wanted to meet you

549
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,008
That's why l came personally
to give the blouse

550
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,285
Daughter got admission in
Dawn international school

551
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,386
The fees is little higher than expected

552
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,852
You must give Rs 25000 and help me

553
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,585
Why should you seek
admission in a posh school?

554
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,319
Peck what the beak can hold...

555
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,828
The beak will hold

556
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,993
Let me start the garment company
lt will all become alright

557
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,430
Rather than thinking about giving
good education when l can afford...

558
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,472
...is it not betterto go
for it right from start?

559
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,801
You know about my position

560
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,774
Last Tamil film's balance payment
l am yet to receive

561
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,812
Junior artists are pressurizing me

562
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,906
l told them they could
get it either today ortomorrow

563
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,847
ln case he gives full payment
sometimes l may be able to help you

564
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,751
But l can't assure you

565
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,887
Pappeta Can you get from somewhere...

566
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,987
Mister Yourjunior artists
are not performing well

567
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,860
That is why they are still junior artists

568
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,832
Else will not they become
Mammukka or Mohanlal

569
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,832

''Finish my flirtatious dance''

''Finish my flirtatious dance''

614
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,672
Not only in US...

615
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,110
Korea, Japan, Holland, ltaly...

616
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:07,241
...briefly in all 7 continents
our kids are there

617
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,849
They have come
through these hands

618
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:14,285
But a Malayali couple from US
is here forthe first time

619
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,788
We can just say
we are Malyalees

620
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,795
l am born and
brought up in States

621
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,889
Alex and family is settled
there for quite sometime

622
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,060
We don't have much acquaintance
with relatives in Kerala

623
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,764
You know doctor

624
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,897
First we went to
Gujarat for surrogacy

625
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,134
But they are not ready
to show the donor

626
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,110
And finally Dr Cherian
suggested you

627
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,615
The woman who let her uterus...
l mean the donor

628
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,776
Normally we don't
expose them to the clients

629
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,377
Afterthe delivery, we get the baby
and hand it over to the parents

630
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,122
That is the procedure

631
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,887
Me and doctor Cherian were classmates
at Vellore Medical college

632
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,896
Just because he has recommended you,
l would show you the donor

633
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:59,032
l am particularthat whatever
l do must be perfect

634
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,264
Actually l expected
bigger setups here

635
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,171
Do you have facilities
for delivery here?

636
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,301
lf the patient becomes pregnant...

637
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,370
l would register her in an hospital
where l work as consultant

638
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,742
The treatment and delivery
would take place there

639
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,283
That's fine

640
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:19,254
l have also planned for a 50 crore
setup with all amenities

641
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,621
- Great
- One minute

642
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,990
Sir, you have received a notice
for not paying the car loan

643
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,122
Car loan?

644
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:32,225
Will there be a delay in getting Benz
Then book Land cruiser

645
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,201
l want it immediately

646
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,866
l am in a meeting
Don't disturb me

647
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,232
Luxury car is my weakness

648
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,972
Regarding perfection...
l also don't lag behind

649
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,442
That is why l have located
a wholesome donor foryou

650
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,379
l will show you

651
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,247
Ask Aishwarya Devi to come here

652
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,727
Best

653
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,893
Aishwarya Devi

654
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:13,001
She has been a surrogate mothertwice
Both times it was a successful delivery

655
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,279
Doctor Can you just ask her
to wait outside

656
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,375
Muthu

657
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,252
Doctor
l am sorry

658
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,289
We are not happy with this lady

659
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,884
We want a beautiful, elegant lady

660
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,687
lt is foolishness

661
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,821
You know the procedures of this treatment

662
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:41,063
Because Swapna's uterus is not capable
to hold a baby for 10 months...

663
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,505
...we are renting a lady
who has that capability

664
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,903
The baby developed for you both...

665
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:52,039
...is just placed
in another woman's uterus

666
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,378
There won't be any biological
relationship with the donor

667
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:00,950
So none of the genetic
features of the donor...

668
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,457
...would manifest in the baby

669
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,159
- Then what bothers you?
- l knowthat doctor

670
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,266
But l want the best in everything

671
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,800
Why can't we try for some other options?

672
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,436
lt is very difficult

673
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,732
People from good lineage
don't come forward for such jobs

674
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,002
Let's try...
lf they compromise...

675
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,203
Doctor, we are ready
to pay even extra forthat

676
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,747
Extra money...

677
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,178
We will try our best

678
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,551
Doctor None of them is suitable

679
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,814
lf you can't get a good person
with in a week's time

680
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,190
-We would try in Mumbai
- Don't be upset

681
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,431
lnfertility treatment
will take its own time

682
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,164
ln one week's time
l would get a suitable person

683
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,170
There are plenty of
beautiful girls in the country

684
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,828
Ok doctor, all the best

685
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,339
- Thank you
- See you

686
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,948
Beautiful uterus...

687
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,877
ln this world...

688
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,457
Sir bill has come from workshop
for the repair works done

689
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,550
- Shall l pay Rs 2000?
- Rs 2000?

690
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,418
Where do you have money for that?

691
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,986
- Pay later
- Ok sir

692
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,527
lf the car dashed her,
l can agree

693
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:51,601
Robber

694
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,507
- lt is paining
- Give her Rs 500

695
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,242
She is enacting a scent
to make a livelihood

696
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:04,212
The rate will increase,
if they mob you

697
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,349
Gold rate increase has no significance

698
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,889
l knew about it
when l went for pledging

699
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,357
They charge exorbitant interest

700
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,463
There is a shortfall of
Rs 7000 to remit the fees

701
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,422
What will you do for that?

702
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:28,496
lt is said, in a person's life
there must be friends or relatives...

703
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,369
...at least 5 persons
to help him financially

704
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,941
Do you have any such persons?

705
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,272
l don't have any
Do you have any?

706
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,539
But we don't get in to such a situation

707
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,077
- Good afternoon
- Good afternoon

708
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:42,015
My God Was it you sir
the other day...

709
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,178
Yes, l am doctor John Chittilapally

710
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,586
Why are you here doctor?
Any problem with that lady?

711
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,693
- No, l need your help
- My help?

712
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,088
Yes, l am running an infertility clinic

713
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,993
lnfertility clinic means...

714
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,193
ls it not the clinic
which makes babies?

715
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,463
Yes, is she your wife?

716
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,995
You can say like that also

717
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,233
An American couple
has come to rent an uterus

718
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,711
They didn't like the beauty
of the women whom my agent bought

719
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,178
Quite natural Any one will like
the baby to be beautiful

720
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,546
This is a misconception

721
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,247
There are many types of lVF treatments

722
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:22,724
The lady has a weak uterus
lt can't carry a baby

723
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,451
So the parent fertilised embryo...

724
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,498
- Embryo...?
- Foetus

725
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,331
Will be placed in
another woman's uterus

726
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:36,065
10 months later the delivered baby
will be handed over to the parents

727
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,199
There won't be any blood relatioship
with the surrogate mother

728
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,972
Similarto keeping unripe plantain clusters
in paddy chests to ripen it

729
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,982
After it ripens the cluster will not have
the features of the paddy chest

730
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,520
Correct
Astrange metaphor

731
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,124
There is a similar scene
in a Mohanlal movie

732
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,748
l have not seen
the newfilm of Mohanlal

733
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,755
This is not a new film
Avery old film...

734
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,326
- ls it 'Manjil virinja Pookkal'?
- Not that old

735
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,399
Not 'Manjil Virinja Pookkal'

736
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,761
- lt's 'Dasharatham'
-Yes exactly

737
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,437
But in that movie the baby's
mother was the real mother

738
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,233
But here that is not the situation

739
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,502
-Yet, it was sentimental
- l wept a lot

740
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:18,445
An elegant woman who would
rent her uterus is required

741
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,982
You must help me to locate one

742
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,381
What do you think of me, doctor?

743
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,578
lt is true there is
paucity of funds for me

744
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,987
l do real estate and many other
sundry business, l agree

745
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,582
But so far l am fortunate not to indulge
in cases related with women

746
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,187
- Doctor you may leave, go
- l didn't mean that

747
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,262
The other day l dashed car on a woman

748
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,026
She is the right one for this

749
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,625
You said she has no means
to eke out a living

750
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,568
Rs 10 lakhs is offered to
a woman who donates her uterus

751
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,769
ln addition you will get
Rs 25000, as commission

752
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,377
lf l meet her directly,
it may not work out

753
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,680
But you have the grasp to convince her

754
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,455
l have, still...

755
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,791
Because it is related with women...

756
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,625
Fees...

757
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:10,023
What you said is right
She needs money

758
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,796
But to convince herto agree
forthis will be a huge task

759
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,628
One...

760
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,239
Fifty...

761
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,639
lf you give 50,000,
l can try

762
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,267
50,000?

763
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,109
lf you want 50, ok l agree

764
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,407
But l need it immediately

765
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,544
Then we can go now, isn't it?

766
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:30,780
Do one thing doctor

767
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,617
Let your vehicle be here
We will go in my vehicle

768
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,656
Ok where is the car?

769
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,157
- Get on sir
-You mean this one?

770
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,658
We have to go through narrow lanes

771
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,852
- Come
- Okay

772
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,625
Ride carefully
ls this vehicle home made?

773
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,768
- She was residing somewhere here?
- Don't you know?.

774
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,202
Sumithra, Mosque street

775
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,669
Yes, this is the one

776
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,644
Come

777
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,741
You first find out
if she is inclined...

778
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,280
lf she is willing,
l would tell her the details

779
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,614
Don't upset her

780
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,884
What you have been told
is correct

781
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,387
First l will go

782
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,822
Damn with his English

783
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,542
ls it you?
To my house

784
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,839
M God Come in
Come

785
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,245
Come inside

786
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,747
You, in my house...

787
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,580
Sit down

788
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,720
- Husband...
- He...

789
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,195
l told you the other day
He is in Bombay

790
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:52,167
- Has he not yet come from Bombay?
- He will not come

791
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,697
What is this?
Why have you come at this time?

792
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,830
What's the matter?

793
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,539
Hello, is he your son?

794
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,679
Ganesh get up

795
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,141
Go go and play

796
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,749
He has gone

797
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,281
Nowtell me

798
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,782
lnfinity of fertilisation

799
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,225
-We have been to...
- Tamil...

800
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:26,197
Because this is about
physical relationship...

801
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,770
...how can l tell you openly

802
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:28,735
One...

803
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,609
When a man and woman
consummate a baby is born

804
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,476
Now, even if they consummate
the baby may not be born

805
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,307
Forthat...

806
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,277
Forthat, there are
lot of safe methods

807
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,381
Not that...

808
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,397
Sperm
Sperm

809
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,659
lt needs an uterus, isn't it?

810
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,529
Then only things will happen

811
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,597
ln a nutshell,
with regard to this...

812
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,765
...if you cooperate
it would happen

813
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,939
When you say so much,
will l decline?

814
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,775
At night, come through the back door

815
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,819
l would keep the door open for you

816
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,321
Can you get me
some water for drinking?

817
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,449
One minute

818
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,287
M god
Doctor

819
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,234
Have you explained to her?

820
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,768
This will not work out
We will go for someone else

821
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,302
- So will it not be possible?
- lt is possible

822
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,701
- Then l will talk to her
- Not that

823
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,830
What we planned will not happen

824
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,841
-Why?
- She is very decent

825
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,969
-You get on to the vehicle
- l don't understand

826
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,376
Has it become an issue?

827
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,012
My dear...
Slowly

828
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,347
For quite sometime
we are roaming like this

829
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,756
Do you have any one in mind?

830
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,728
People with lot of hardship
and suffering will only agree forthis

831
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:01,659
What?

832
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,595
l said people with hardship
and suffering will only agree

833
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:07,260
ls there anyone like that?

834
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:10,867
A stunt artist called Murugan
He had an accident in a shoot

835
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,375
He broke his back and
is in bed for last 2 years

836
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,536
- He is in adversity
-Very good

837
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,044
ls his wife good looking?

838
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,339
Wife is good looking
She will suit us

839
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,973
ln that case,
go straight to his house

840
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,881
Thank God

841
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,963
All people who reside here are poor

842
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,798
For your sake, l have come here
Else l don't come this side

843
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,663
This is a good place
ldeal for a resort

844
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,895
She is Murugan's wife

845
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,437
Come come
This is the way

846
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,803
Greet you madam

847
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,668
-Why have you come this side?
- No, doctor has come to see Murugan

848
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,110
- DoctorJohn Chittilapalli
- ls it, come please

849
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,105
-Where is he?
- He is here

850
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,509
Come

851
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,377
How are you Murugan?

852
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,988
For last two years l am bed ridden

853
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:05,450
No means for livelihood
God only should pave a way for me

854
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,928
AGod in the form of a human being

855
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,764
Doctor has come
He will explain the rest to you

856
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,536
You know Mr Murugan...

857
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,538
lnvitrio fertilization
is notjust a treatment

858
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,074
lt is a service
and a divine duty

859
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,339
Doctor you can talk in Malayalam

860
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,937
l have performed as a dupe
for all Malayalam hero's

861
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,846
l can understand Malayalam

862
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,976
- Money is our problem
- Their problem is having a baby

863
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,953
Talk in Malayalam

864
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:39,553
l like your wife
She is beautiful and elegant

865
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,622
lf you can turn a blind eye,
we can make some money using her

866
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,959
lt is only a matter of 10 months

867
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:51,732
lf she becomes pregnant once,
This house would get Rs 10 lakhs

868
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,442
Have you not understood?

869
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,539
There is an American couple

870
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:59,604
Their embryo has to be
deposited in your wife's uterus

871
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,580
Just that

872
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,985
You dog
ldiot

873
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,112
You buffalo

874
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,980
Madam what doctor
intended was in English...

875
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,388
Enough
Please go

876
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,720
Listen to me,
please go

877
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,384
Seems he has not understood
what l said...

878
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:12,462
No doctor, come

879
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,995
Check if they've gone or not?

880
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,898
You said he is bed ridden
But his kicks were solid

881
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,003
Doctorthe way you talk
anyone would boot you

882
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,032
He would have thought
embryo is an abusive word

883
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,905
Had you said foetus even
a child would have understood

884
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,911
Should you not talk about it
subtly and with little niceties

885
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,641
Even if l am subtle,
this is what is required to be conveyed

886
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,582
She was like a former Miss lndia
Anyway we have lost her

887
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,549
We will go for some one else

888
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,052
Miss lndia you mean this woman

889
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,018
Take this

890
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,919
Fighter Murugan was my only hope

891
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,552
But my plan got failed now

892
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,461
Murugan is also gone
What will we do now?.

893
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,627
ls there any otherfight master
or dance master like him

894
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,430
But his wife must be good looking

895
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,904
Get lost doctor

896
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,035
- How much it is?
- 50 rupees

897
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:02,976
Ok brother

898
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,047
- Can meet tomorrow at Rolands hotel
-You just give me a call

899
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,046
Ok bye

900
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,886
That girl is good looking

901
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:13,954
-You mean that girl
-Yes

902
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,547
- She is a case
- ls she an advocate

903
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,024
Not that case

904
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,924
Brief bundle Rosili,
she is a Malayali

905
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,155
She will not be suitable

906
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:24,097
How will the Americans
know about her?

907
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,898
lf she is elegant and has an
uterus inside that will do

908
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,107
My god, it didn't occur to me
This will surely happen

909
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,640
Doctor do you have a kerchief?

910
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,641
Why?

911
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,506
lt would be better
to cover the face

912
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,580
- ls it a must
-Yes come

913
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,978
Will people with esteem agree to this?

914
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,914
Come with a brief

915
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,817
Don't you have mother
and sisters at home?

916
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,480
Trying to make me pregnant

917
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,821
lf l walk along with a swollen stomach,
what would people say about me?

918
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:50,950
Talking about people

919
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,621
What would they say
lt is for nothing

920
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,095
lt is only after paying you 10 lakhs

921
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,496
The money will take care
of your shame

922
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,499
lt would

923
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,735
lf l leave the field,
people are queuing to take my place

924
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,307
When l come after delivery
there will be no demand for me

925
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,544
lf a girl delivers a baby without husband,
will anyone marry her afterwards

926
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,079
- Doctor will you marry?
- l am married

927
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:12,546
- Tailor will you marry?
- l will not...

928
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,139
-Will you?
- No

929
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,013
She is a hothead

930
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,781
Before she goes to
the next level, let's go

931
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,085
Bye sister
Don't take it to heart

932
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,627
- So we need not wait here
- Fellows don't have any self respect

933
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,059
Don't know if anyone
has noticed us

934
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,926
No one knows me in this area

935
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,124
Hi buddy How are you?

936
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,724
l couldn't get you

937
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,928
Don't you know me?
l am your Facebook friend nine

938
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,870
For yesterday's picture post
you commented as 'awesome'

939
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,908
Does your profile has
film star Nayantara's photo?

940
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:40,840
Yes

941
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:45,170
Now l have understood
My god he has deceived me

942
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,078
What is it doctor?

943
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,740
Have you met film star Nayantara?

944
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:48,841
- No...
- Then see him

945
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,351
Now he is doing this business

946
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,221
Ok buddy

947
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,757
- Nayantara bye
- Ok bye dear

948
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,232
Start Landed in a problem

949
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,311
Start the bike

950
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,644
They are transgender, go

951
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,192
Ranjith

952
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,063
Ranjith l can't run
Stop the vehicle

953
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,144
Don't throw it madam

954
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,349
No one gives respect

955
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,782
Doctor Should we not do
thejobs we are supposed to do?

956
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,409
l am not for this uterus
business any more

957
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,020
Don't take a vow like that
We will give a short break, come

958
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,264
Janaki Bring some water

959
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,938
What happened?
Did you not succeed?

960
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,111
Then what will we do?

961
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,974
What can we do?

962
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,845
We can't kill or rob someone

963
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,852
The school fees,
garment unit advance

964
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,988
You can get good money for gold

965
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,689
Only forfew days

966
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,832
Once l start the garment company

967
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,133
This is a letterfrom
the industries office

968
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,403
lf we don't pay the cash
before this Friday...

969
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,071
...the allotment of the unit
to us will be cancelled

970
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,919
Looks like all our hopes
will be ruined

971
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,016
lf we couldn't start this...

972
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,023
l don't think we will
ever be able to start it

973
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,024
May be forever we are destined to live
with the tailor shop...

974
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,460
...and one room house

975
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:30,738
lf we play smart we can escape
There is a way

976
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,140
What is it?

977
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:40,518
By play, l mean it is an act
as though l get a role in films

978
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,217
l would play that role with ease

979
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,518
What is that role?

980
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,486
A pregnant woman's role

981
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:52,197
Did he not say he would give
Rs 10 lakhs for the uterus donor?

982
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,064
Yes

983
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,296
lf we get 10 lakhs
all our problems would vanish...

984
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,170
...and we would be safe, isn't it?

985
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,038
Even 8 lakhs will do for us

986
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,304
Once the company is started...

987
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,403
l can show you how we can earn

988
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,484
Then can we look in to it?

989
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:09,483
What?

990
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,149
10 months would pass quickly
We would get Rs 10 lakhs too

991
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,254
What are you trying to say?

992
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:24,298
lf l take up the role of
an uterus donor...

993
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,332
What nonsense are you talking?

994
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,465
Uterus, rent
it's all very complicated

995
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,509
We don't want any fortune
earned this way

996
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,937
How could you say this?

997
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,011
lf l had not stopped acting...

998
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,521
l would have acted as a heroine
for Mammukka or Mohanlal

999
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:49,114
lf l act as a wife sometimes,
l may have to act as a pregnant woman

1000
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,094
Similarly this is also an acting

1001
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:57,530
Pregnancy in films
is made up with pillows

1002
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,102
But this is a real American pregnancy

1003
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,103
Life is not like films

1004
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,297
Forget all this...

1005
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,136
What would you tell
if our relatives and friends ask you?

1006
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,266
Why do you talk about relatives?

1007
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,813
Our people expelled both of us
because ours was a love marriage

1008
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:15,408
Friends Must tell them it is
a second baby and distribute sweets

1009
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,953
What will you do if they ask
forthe baby after 10 months

1010
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,182
Must tell them
the baby was still born

1011
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:25,318
-Janaki Are you so callous?
- lt is all theatrics

1012
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,556
Tell them the delivery was
at an aunt's place in Tambaram

1013
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,928
So we couldn't inform anyone

1014
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,866
Even if there are few murmur once
we become rich and pompous...

1015
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,631
...that would change gradually

1016
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,395
America has shown
as a way to get out of this mess

1017
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:39,998
Don't reject it

1018
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,345
Hearing this makes my vision blurred

1019
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,915
Then hold a candle and sit there

1020
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,281
Long ago they wanted me to do a role
opposite Chiranjeevi in a Telugu film

1021
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,858
l never knew about it

1022
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,527
At that time our love was soaring
and l left the house with you

1023
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,895
Else by now l would have
been like Trisha and Asin

1024
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,362
What can l do?

1025
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:11,029
lt is my destiny,
l should suffer like this

1026
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:34,419
Acting is an art that
requires physical exertions

1027
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,397
Must run, jump and fight

1028
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,627
Like that this should also
be considered as an art...

1029
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,400
...that requires
physical exertions, is it not?

1030
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,409
Not only that,
helping childless people...

1031
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,948
...will it not be
a large hearted benevolent act

1032
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,577
Besides, since there is no
blood relationship with the baby...

1033
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,588
...we can return the baby easily

1034
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,919
Absolutely

1035
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:09,395
Why did not the American
people come little earlier?

1036
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,591
There is a time for everything

1037
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:25,279
- Doctor You didn't say anything
- Should we do it?

1038
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,483
Normally women who come
forward for this...

1039
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,143
...does not have any emotional feelings

1040
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,721
But an home maker like your wife...

1041
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,650
You need not get tensed over that

1042
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,249
Regarding this, she is
more interested than me

1043
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,328
So come to clinic, tomorrow
Some tests have to be done

1044
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,230
lf the tests are ok,
we can meet the American people

1045
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,131
Agreed

1046
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,972
After amassing money
l want to start a beauty parlour

1047
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,136
Betterthan that would be
to employ a beautician

1048
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,337
- ls it?
- Have this

1049
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,613
- Get ready quickly
- l am ready

1050
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,021
Janaki You have studied up to what?

1051
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,295
Doctor did not say
anything about studies...

1052
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,158
Studies...

1053
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,231
lt's ok, l merely asked

1054
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,631
l like you

1055
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,794
Ok doctor, let us proceed

1056
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:27,609
ln lieu of donating the uterus
they would give you Rs 10 lakhs

1057
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,201
5 lakhs advance...

1058
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,475
Balance 5 lakhs after delivery
when you hand over the baby

1059
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,110
Doctor Can't you give
10 lakhs in one shot?

1060
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,819
The medical practice dictum is...

1061
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,558
Half the job is done by doctor
and the other half by God

1062
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,786
Though we do everything
to the best of our ability...

1063
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:48,326
Sometimes it may not be successful

1064
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,725
Sometimes problems could arise
due to the carelessness of the pregnant lady

1065
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,532
ln such a situation
they should not lose the entire money

1066
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:04,273
We can not move forward
without mutual trust

1067
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,381
Ok doctor

1068
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:12,743
We have come forward to do this
not merely for the money you offer

1069
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:18,419
Helping a childless couple to
get a child is a benevolent act

1070
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,156
l really appreciate your generosity

1071
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,860
Once you become pregnant...

1072
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:29,594
Protein, Calcium, Fiber
you should take rich nutritious foods

1073
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,765
That will cost extra

1074
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,803
Nutritious foods are very expensive

1075
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,846
lt is ok, tell me how much you want?

1076
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,342
l want...

1077
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,648
lt's ok, l told know
lt's a benevolent act

1078
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:44,845
That's good

1079
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:53,251
After embryo transfer,
they want to return to America

1080
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,557
Both of them are employed and busy

1081
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,100
They can come again
the next day after the delivery

1082
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,428
Now we can sign the agreement

1083
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,795
This has 5 lakhs

1084
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:57,825
''Like a five petalled flower bloom in sky''

1085
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:02,331
''At dawn a star
appeared and vanished''

1086
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:11,170
''Like a soulful transparent gem
Like the prosperous divine music...''

1087
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:19,839
''ln the woods at prolonged
night time it gleamed and bloomed''

1088
01:05:55,284 --> 01:06:02,952
''The pain, sorrow and
the mute grief disappeared''

1089
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:12,528
''lntense warmth
blossomed again like a lotus''

1090
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,901
''Would celebrate Onam in some dream''

1091
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:21,340
''Hard times would come
to mind without recollection''

1092
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:27,042
''Would push behind
the distance travelled''

1093
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:51,463
''Like a five petalled flower
bloom in the sky''

1094
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:55,806
''At dawn a star
appeared and vanished''

1095
01:06:55,911 --> 01:07:04,944
''Like a soulful transparent gem
Like the prosperous divine music...''

1096
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:13,451
''ln the woods at prolonged
night time it gleamed and bloomed''

1097
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,464
First or second...?

1098
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,860
First or second?

1099
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,098
First one?

1100
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,000
First one is a daughter

1101
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,438
So you would be longing
for a male child this time

1102
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,409
Boy or girl
lt is all same for me

1103
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,483
That is also right

1104
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,109
These days boy or girl
expenses are more less same

1105
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,886
Who is Janaki's husband?

1106
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:19,552
You sit down
They are calling me

1107
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,456
lt's me

1108
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,628
Here your baby

1109
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,131
Yes it is me

1110
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,368
lt is a male child

1111
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,096
-Janaki How is Janaki?
- She is normal

1112
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:33,641
After some time
she will be shifted to room

1113
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,138
You may take him

1114
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,049
You could have taken
the baby in your hands

1115
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,550
There are people to do that

1116
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,389
l don't have faith in all these

1117
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,125
Sweet boy

1118
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:04,062
-Why is he wearing a shirt?
- Doctor said it can be worn

1119
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,601
How do you feel now?.

1120
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:12,405
l just fed him
He is very fair

1121
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,650
All new born babies will be very fair

1122
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,784
More over baby's parents are Americans

1123
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:30,087
You look very tired
Agood sleep will make you alright

1124
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:37,198
Shall we take the baby to the doctor...

1125
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,573
...and ask for the settlement

1126
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:10,796
Dear

1127
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:27,013
Count the cash correctly

1128
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,021
Should you tell me that specifically?

1129
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,569
May l come in doctor?

1130
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,888
Thus everything ended well

1131
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,521
Doctor Look at this baby

1132
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,658
See how charming he is

1133
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:10,321
Not 10 lakhs,
even 50 lakhs can be given

1134
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,566
You are right

1135
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,969
So doctor Receive this trophy...

1136
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,934
...and give the balance amount

1137
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,600
Where are those American guys?

1138
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:26,076
There is a small issue
They have not yet arrived

1139
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,318
What happened?
Have they missed the flight?

1140
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:35,816
Not that There is a small
disagreement between them

1141
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,822
They are divorced and separated

1142
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,827
They don't want this baby now

1143
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:46,598
What?

1144
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,627
l have a meeting
l just forgot about it

1145
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,263
What is it?
Wait for a moment

1146
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,409
Can't you hear the baby crying?

1147
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,277
Should someone tell you
to feed the baby?

1148
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,014
Fed milk just now

1149
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,884
No milk to feed again

1150
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,057
Will you stop it

1151
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:50,222
All the time weeping

1152
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,170
Have you seen feather touch?

1153
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,183
When l am getting mad
you are talking about touch

1154
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:11,081
Not that

1155
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,720
l am talking about
the film 'Feather touch'

1156
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,185
There is a scene in that film

1157
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,105

1171
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,377
Move away

1172
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:21,148
Man's children are His fortune

1173
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,381
Come

1174
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,950
Man's children are His fortune

1175
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:28,545
From each one's deeds
His varied fortunes rise

1176
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:36,462
Get on

1177
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,563
Sorry dear

1178
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,972
l can understand a mother's grief

1179
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,533
lt is ok

1180
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,575
Not grief

1181
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:54,415
lf that mad guy killed the baby...

1182
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:57,974
...and dumped him in garbage bin
we would be behind the bars

1183
01:15:58,353 --> 01:15:59,615
You are right

1184
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,190
That's why l took him back

1185
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,416
Don't become too sentimental

1186
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,354
-Was it little excessive?
- Little

1187
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:09,327
Come, let's go

1188
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,474
You must listen to me

1189
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,070
To leave a baby in orphanage
or give for adoption...

1190
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,978
...there are few legal complications

1191
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,246
You must remember one more thing

1192
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,879
Americans change their
mind at the drop of a hat

1193
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,649
Today they may separate
Tomorrowthey may reunite

1194
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,857
ln case the baby's parents come...

1195
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,553
...to take the baby
after a week orfortnight?

1196
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,891
Will you not get your 5 lakhs?

1197
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,032
But...if they come again...

1198
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,364
l would not give the baby
unless they give 15 lakhs

1199
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,429
15 lakhs?

1200
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:57,100
Don't give until they pay 15

1201
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,303
Now you take the baby and go

1202
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,220
Little brother

1203
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,987
Little brother, are you playing

1204
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,154
Janaki You did not
inform us your arrival

1205
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,288
Yesterday night only we planned

1206
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,424
Darling Eyes are like his mother

1207
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:24,395
- Nose is like his father
-Yes, yes

1208
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,176
How is it possible?

1209
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,403
We've sent the money to the company
Machines have also come

1210
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,104
Sir, please

1211
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,111
How can you ask now?

1212
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,306
Sir What l want to convey is...

1213
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,940
Don't worry ln two week's
time pay the balance amount...

1214
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,986
...and take delivery of the machines

1215
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,717
Will you give cash?

1216
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,616
Tell me

1217
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,292
You should tell him no

1218
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,616
You don't brood over it

1219
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,782
When a door is closed
another door will open

1220
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,622
When you venture in to a business
these things do happen

1221
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,991
Don't become diffident over this

1222
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:57,465
Some way out will be in sight

1223
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,171

01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:41,168
When some babies are born
along with that good times also start

1235
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:45,269
Goddess Lakshmi can be born
through such babies too

1236
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,342
That is true

1237
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,481
Gods can manifest in any form

1238
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:55,345
When manager informed
about the sanction of loan...

1239
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,584
...initially l thought it was a dream

1240
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,588
Howto describe my happiness

1241
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,720
lt was like a snake bite
under a thunderbolt

1242
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,130
Whatever it is
our good times have started

1243
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:07,565
Now we should become
the top drawers

1244
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,435
But the adage you said
was not appropriate

1245
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,370
For predicaments like this...

1246
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,877
Coconut falling on the head of
a pooping dog would be appropriate

1247
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,134
That can also be said

1248
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:20,646
But for such situations there
are few proverbs in English

1249
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,183
Whatever happens
should have been there...

1250
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:23,751
Not like that

1251
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,844
Should have been
the pening, happening

1252
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,782
That one...

1253
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,323
- Some one is calling
- Ranjith

1254
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,186
Yes, come in

1255
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,489
-Where is he?
-Who?

1256
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,192
See Have a good look

1257
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,695
Very beautiful child

1258
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:44,769
ls it ok?

1259
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:47,100
Ok

1260
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,803
Please stay out for some time
l would come there

1261
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,542
What is this Pappetta?

1262
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,247
They are from Vijay movie

1263
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,885
There is a scene where Vijay
as a new born baby

1264
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,417
They need a baby for that
He is ok for them

1265
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,684
ls this the matter?
You scared me

1266
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:04,588
Why?

1267
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,856
So Pappetta, is there
a combination scene with Vijay?

1268
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,225
How idiotic are you?

1269
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,424
This baby has to grow
to become Vijay

1270
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,727
l didn't think about it

1271
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,564
Shall l proceed further?

1272
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,601
- Okay?
- Okay

1273
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,415
They are not very interested in films

1274
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:30,541
But l somehow convinced them
They are ok for Rs 50,000

1275
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:34,411
Give Rs 25000 as advance
Give balance at the location

1276
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,159
Take this

1277
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,489
- M commission is additional
- Okay

1278
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:53,270
Take this fortutious advance Rs 25000

1279
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,673
Balance 25000 will be
paid at the location

1280
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,570
Sir What is the baby's name?

1281
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:59,739
Baby's name
Name...

1282
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,380
He is yet to be named

1283
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,680
But we are contemplating
to name him as Baghynathan

1284
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:08,686
Yes But at home
we call him lucky

1285
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,619
He is not mere lucky
He is a lucky star

1286
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,321
Lucky star

1287
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,728
ls it son?

1288
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,367
Mom would you give milk

1289
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,268
Come

1290
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:25,373
Lucky darling

1291
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:29,635
Come

1292
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:09,440
''Forthis little cherub we would place
a dot on the chubby cheek today''

1293
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,883
''When the baby is dolled up...''

1294
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:14,421
''Nourish her with smiles''

1295
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:19,425
''Sport smiles and have fun
Nowfly high''

1296
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:24,658
''Narrate the story of trapping
uncle moon in a conical bowl''

1297
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:12,606
''lt's a word that effused the water
that entered the boat''

1298
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,114
''Thoughts and dreams are insufficient''

1299
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,715
''Need a lamp that guards the trove''

1300
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,550
''Need a vision that looks inward''

1301
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:10,794
''Forthis little cherub we would place
a dot on the chubby cheek today''

1302
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,397
''When the baby is dolled up...''

1303
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,772
''Nourish her with smiles''

1304
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:20,645
''Have fun sporting smiles
Nowfly high''

1305
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:25,786
''Narrate the story of trapping
uncle moon in a conical bowl''

1306
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,930
Where have l kept it?

1307
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:43,025
Megha

1308
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,166
Megha

1309
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:50,877
- Did you see my phone?
- No

1310
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:53,104
Check if it is there in the fridge?

1311
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,440
Will anyone keep phone in fridge?

1312
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,543
Don't know where that
boy would keep it

1313
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,584
Let me check

1314
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,083
We should not go after love

1315
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,162
lt should happen on its own
lt should ravage us

1316
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,225
Should turn us upside down

1317
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:13,657
Always should be with me
That is true love

1318
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:14,633
Hey cut it

1319
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,761
Gaurav
Don't do like Simbu's dad

1320
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,100
Do like Simbu

1321
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,102
We should not go after love

1322
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,873
lt should happen on its own
lt should ravage us

1323
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:25,775
Enough

1324
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,507
ls mom's phone your play toy?

1325
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,174
Not playing
lt's my film's shoot, sister

1326
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:32,481
Are films shot in mobile phones?

1327
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:34,988
Sister This is a new generation film

1328
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,021
Hereafter, if you touch mom's phone...

1329
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:41,095
...l would throw away
all your toys, mind it

1330
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:42,826
Pack up

1331
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,957
Lucky Don't get upset

1332
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:49,503
Of late all fools have taken up direction

1333
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:51,799
Let us play some other game

1334
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,703
Come

1335
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,943
Gosh

1336
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,775
Lucky ls this the way to do colouring?

1337
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,815
Elephant should be given black colour

1338
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,680
Have you seen
a green elephant anywhere?

1339
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:09,485
And red colourtusks
On the whole you have messed up

1340
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:17,723
Dad See how l have coloured it?
ls it not super?

1341
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,800
Fantastic
Great

1342
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,727
-Am l not a genius dad?
-Absolutely

1343
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,999
Why not we send this to some
magazine's colouring competition?

1344
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:28,803
lf they select this
you would get a big prize

1345
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:29,843
Good idea

1346
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:33,003
Those who run the magazine are not fools

1347
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,275
Why do you waste money
on postage stamps?

1348
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,781
She is jealous of you
Go and complete it son

1349
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,621
This is Lucky's progress report

1350
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,659
The maximum he got is B or B+

1351
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,994
l don't see him evince
any interest in studies

1352
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,828
He is not doing lAS

1353
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:56,900
Don't get tensed over
the studies of a 1st grade boy

1354
01:27:57,005 --> 01:28:00,771
See if his cognition develops,
if he can manage his own routines

1355
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,900
These are the things
one should check at this age

1356
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:05,707
When he comes to higher grades
he would secure Aand A +

1357
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,782
- ls it not lucky?
- lt is very difficult

1358
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:12,882
Dad, l have something to tell you

1359
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:15,182
l don't want to study in a school
where education is merely academic

1360
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,884
l told you not to enroll me
in sister's school

1361
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,723
He studying in my school
harms my reputation too

1362
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,763
l am school's best student

1363
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:26,831
Keep quiet, bright student

1364
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:31,899
Dad Next year admit me
in Gaurav's school

1365
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,136
They teach swimming,
skating and Karate

1366
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,009
Then l will secure A+

1367
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:40,009
You mean Mount Carmel School

1368
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,012
Exactly

1369
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,384
Getting admission there is bit difficult

1370
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,676
Nonetheless we can make a try
What do you say?

1371
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,812
You are only pampering
and spoiling him

1372
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,049
Don't dance to his tunes

1373
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:50,351
Give him two whacks
and make him study

1374
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,354
A and A+ would come automatically

1375
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,596
Did you see the Hindi film '3 idiots'?

1376
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:57,597
ln that film, regarding
children's education...

1377
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,600
- l am not an idiot like you
- ls it?

1378
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:03,034
You are after all an old
10th grade failed girl

1379
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:06,696
-What about you?
- l am an 8th grade fail

1380
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,881
Make a brochure giving
importance to spring collections

1381
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:17,780
Ok sir

1382
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,854
Because the designs include a variety
we may secure good orders

1383
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:21,853
Sure sir

1384
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:25,850
Vincent l called you some time ago

1385
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,696
ls the Mount Carmel school
principal your relative?

1386
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,064
lt is about an admission for Lucky?

1387
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,326
Yes my son

1388
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,169
Why not?

1389
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:37,165
Any time l can come and meet you

1390
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:39,030
Ok, bye

1391
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:41,899
Give it to the printing section

1392
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:42,703
Ok sir

1393
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:49,716
Last time Ranjith was the main sponsor
for a race event conducted by our school

1394
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:54,686
He is one among the few Chennai Malayali's
whom we can rely upon anytime

1395
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,023
Very glad

1396
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,652
Merit is our criteria for admission

1397
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,321
There is an aptitude test
for lnter school transfer

1398
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:06,127
He must get through that test
Hope your son is a brilliant student

1399
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,197
Yes, he is brilliant

1400
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:13,203
But he is more interested
in sports and skating

1401
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,401
We do considerthose
who excel in sports too

1402
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,409
Then we can try on that quota

1403
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:19,411
Let it be...

1404
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:22,245
Ok father We would
submit his application

1405
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,181
- Thank you so much
- Welcome

1406
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:29,679
- Good morning
- Hi Jan You are late today

1407
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:34,728
l was replying to
my birthday wishes in Facebook

Have you understood now?.
He is not much attached to mom and dad

1430
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,977
You both all the time pamper him
Keep him on your head and coddle him

1431
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:07,988
Megha Don't talk as though
you are grown up

1432
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:12,058

1492
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,999
Dr John

01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:13,496
-Any news?

1494
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,536
They are still looking for him

1495
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:43,028
The Malayali boy Lucky
who went missing...

1496
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:45,105
...after he fell in
the drainage at Chennai

1497

...was rescued with the help of army
after long hours of rescue operations

1498
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:50,804

1500
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:11,631

The boy is in lCU
His condition is still critical

1502
01:42:23,437 --> 01:42:25,462
What do you mean Swapna?

1503
01:42:26,573 --> 01:42:28,768
lf you want the wedding to be postponed...

1504
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,134
...you've got to be kidding

1505
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:36,140
Steve You don't understand
l can never be a mother

1506
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:42,180
So l want my son
l really do want him

1507
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:46,550
See Swapna
You need to take a decision

1508
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:49,688
Either it is your son or me

1509
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:52,124
But once you go
Once you decide to go...

1510
01:42:52,232 --> 01:42:55,133
...don't expect me to wait here for you

1511
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:38,176
- Excuse me
- Tell me madam

1512
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:41,275
- Room number 202
- Go straight and turn right

1513
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:42,708
Ok, thank you

1514
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:09,207
Madam Who are you?

1515
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:18,117
Madam Don't worry

1516
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:20,812
He would be discharged
in 2 or 3 days time

1517
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:39,703
Should l inform someone...?

1518
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,548
This is the wedding gown
for minister's daughter

1519
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:50,139
She is little fatty

1520
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:54,084
So do it in a crushed
material in dark colour

1521
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:58,591
Give small folds in the side
That would make it appear slim

1522
01:45:00,594 --> 01:45:02,562
- Sir You have a visitor
-Ask him to come

1523
01:45:04,364 --> 01:45:08,960
Long ago when he was an MLA
l have stitched few blouses for his wife

1524
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,094
Do it quickly in Photoshop

1525
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:17,871
Good morning Mr Ranjith

1526
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:27,917

01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,188
Yes l have recogonised

1528
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:33,723
But meeting you here,
quite unexpectedly...

1529
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:37,630
Can l sit here?

1530
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:39,356
l am so sorry

1531
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:41,327
Please sit

1532
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:44,270

All the designs are good

01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:04,691
Thank you

1535
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:09,958
There is a great demand for
lndian designs in America

1536
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:12,964
Sometimes l too get orders

1537
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,847
Beautiful

1538
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,181
How is Lucky now?

1539
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:36,254
How is Lucky?

1540
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:40,052
He is fine

1541
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:44,655
ln 2 or 3 days he would be discharged

1542
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:46,926
- He is fine
- Thank God

1543
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:06,216
Afterthe divorce,
did you meet him again?

1544
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:10,723
Yes At a mall

1545
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:18,426
He has married an American woman
and his father of two kids

1546
01:47:22,736 --> 01:47:23,828
Did you...

1547
01:47:26,139 --> 01:47:27,834
l didn't get married again

1548
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:36,249
l have come here
to take Lucky to America

1549
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:40,312
That is not required

1550
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:42,789
l told you, he is fine

1551
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:46,184
He doesn't require
any treatment at America

1552
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,090
Not for treatment

1553
01:47:48,528 --> 01:47:53,488
l want to take him permanently
to bring him up as my son there

1554
01:47:55,969 --> 01:47:58,335
- Tea or Coffee?
- No thanks

1555
01:47:58,438 --> 01:47:59,268
Ok

1556
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:02,064
You didn't answer me

1557
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:07,812
How is it possible?
Lucky is my son

1558
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:09,912
M wife delivered him

1559
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:13,783
Though your wife delivered him
he is my blood

1560
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:18,057
Blood relationship
has no great say in this

1561
01:48:18,558 --> 01:48:21,083
Whoever takes care
to bring up the child...

1562
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:24,527
...is the dad, mom,
brother and sister

1563
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:29,359
We are not formal like you Americans

1564
01:48:29,903 --> 01:48:34,772
But what is his condition here...?
He has fallen in a waste water hole

1565
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:38,436
When l sawthe news
l felt guilty

1566
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:40,812
l am responsible for this

1567
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:45,849
l want to take care off him
and do justice

1568
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:48,386
Hey, relax

1569
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:54,125
Whatever precautions we take
and if the destiny is something else...

1570
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:56,320
...whatever must happen will happen

1571
01:48:57,864 --> 01:49:01,527
You might have been
instrumental for us to get Lucky

1572
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:07,930
But today we love him
more than our daughter

1573
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:11,077
We treat like him as our own son

1574
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:14,881
And it will continue to be so

1575
01:49:15,081 --> 01:49:16,173
That means...

1576
01:49:18,885 --> 01:49:21,615
We can not lose Lucky
That's all

1577
01:49:30,263 --> 01:49:31,355
See you soon

1578
01:49:35,135 --> 01:49:39,572
Mr Ranjith l am going
to handle this legally

1579
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:07,989
ls it Surya Hospital?

1580
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:10,433
Can l speak to Dr Venugopal please?

1581
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:13,301
Yes, it is urgent, please

1582
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:16,301
Lucky lie down

1583
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,905
Mom l want to sit in hall
l want to watch TV

1584
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:24,347
You need not watch TV
Lie quietly

1585
01:50:24,484 --> 01:50:27,112
Else they may take you
to hospital and inject again

1586
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:31,257
You need not have
asked for discharge now

1587
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:34,025
Don't you know
he would be playing around here

1588
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:37,488
What was wrong for him spending
2 or 3 days more in hospital?

1589
01:50:37,597 --> 01:50:42,625
Who knows what quakes
will happen 2 or 3 days time?

1590
01:50:42,736 --> 01:50:44,966
l need some water

1591
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:05,085
She is playing with me...

1592
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:08,492
lf she plays with me...
l will teach her lessons

1593
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:12,059
Are you going to act in any drama?

1594
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:15,365
Not drama, it is real

1595
01:51:15,735 --> 01:51:17,134
lt's real and live

1596
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:23,407
Afteryour business clicked
l understand your standard has risen

1597
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:26,946
But when you talk to me
talk straight, no innuendo's

1598
01:51:29,249 --> 01:51:30,079
She...

1599
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:33,015
That American lady has come

1600
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:34,643
Which American lady?

1601
01:51:35,622 --> 01:51:39,023
The lady who rented
the uterus then

1602
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,491
- Same lady
- ls that all?

1603
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:45,597
You could have told her
we have stopped renting uterus

1604
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:51,433
She has not come for that

1605
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,334
Then...?

1606
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:56,608
To take back Lucky

1607
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:32,509
- Leave me mom
- Lucky

1608
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:38,473
She has just asked
She has not taken back Lucky

1609
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,212
l am with you
Don't worry

1610
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:41,283
Nothing

1611
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:01,534
l understand what you say

1612
01:53:02,075 --> 01:53:04,043
But they can not comprehend this

1613
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:08,444
Average lndians still hold their
relationships very dearto them

1614
01:53:08,548 --> 01:53:11,642
Have you not heard the adage
relationships are like gold

1615
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:12,809
But one thing

1616
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:15,785
Try talking to that lady

1617
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:19,750
Amother will understand
the grief of another mother

1618
01:53:23,596 --> 01:53:25,530
Ok, l will meet her

1619
01:53:48,555 --> 01:53:52,116
-Janaki l want to talk to you
- l don't want to hear anything

1620
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:55,690
Then l am going to hold
a press conference and announce it

1621
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:59,458
Let everyone know about
the secret you concealed so long

1622
01:54:05,338 --> 01:54:08,432
You discarded him for 5 years

1623
01:54:09,142 --> 01:54:12,236
What is the guarantee
that you would not do it again?

1624
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:17,374
From the day he was born
not even for a single night...

1625
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:19,747
...he slept away from me

1626
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:23,418
l can not live without him

1627
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:27,123
You don't know about
the losses l have suffered

1628
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:29,827
l was planning
to start a new married life

1629
01:54:30,263 --> 01:54:33,790
But forthe sake of Lucky
l discarded everything

1630
01:54:34,167 --> 01:54:35,657
Now l am alone

1631
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:39,930
M Lucky is not the pluses
and minuses of your weightings

1632
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:44,143
You don't understand the feelings
of woman who gave birth to a child

1633
01:54:44,244 --> 01:54:47,145
l am not prepared for
any loses foryour sake

1634
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:51,149
This obduracy is not good Janaki
One compromise...

1635
01:54:51,384 --> 01:54:54,217
No compromise on Lucky

1636
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:11,201
She wants to file a suit
Let her do it

1637
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:13,831
Any court will have a conscience

1638
01:55:14,807 --> 01:55:17,640
She has come with sentiments
after so long

1639
01:55:19,712 --> 01:55:23,978
We can give her our house
and all other properties

1640
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:28,748
But him...l just want him

1641
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:35,191
Hi Lucky

1642
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:39,388
Lucky come
There is a new rider in the park

1643
01:55:39,499 --> 01:55:41,831
-Angry birds
- l am not coming

1644
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:44,266
- l am afraid
- Come on

1645
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:49,638
Why should you be scared?
Go with them and enjoy

1646
01:55:49,742 --> 01:55:52,609
For next week's skating competition
should you not win the first prize?

1647
01:55:52,712 --> 01:55:54,703
Then only you will get
admission in Mount Carmel school

1648
01:55:54,814 --> 01:55:56,645
- Go...go
- Come on

1649
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:05,523

''Fly all over the world''

1659
01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:28,472
''To destroy the pets''

1660
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:32,441
''Fly all over the world''

1661
01:56:33,353 --> 01:56:36,413
''To destroy the pets''

1662
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,455

01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:04,714
''l want all of them to fly and fly''

1669
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:09,082

''Angry birds say''

1678
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:41,010
Ya man l am coming
Probably in 5 minutes

1679
01:57:41,087 --> 01:57:42,520
At this time, where are you going

1680
01:57:42,622 --> 01:57:45,455
A party at Sham's house
His sister has passed BDS

1681
01:57:45,858 --> 01:57:47,120
Why throw a party forthat

1682
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:49,486
lt's the duty of children
to study and pass

1683
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:50,687
You go inside and study

1684
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,421
Dad, leave me my way

1685
01:57:52,532 --> 01:57:54,124
l know what to study
when to study

1686
01:57:54,367 --> 01:57:57,029
Just keep ready money
for UK MBAadmission

1687
01:57:57,103 --> 01:57:57,933
ls that ok?

1688
01:57:58,037 --> 01:57:58,867
Bye
See you

1689
01:57:58,971 --> 01:58:01,337
Hello, ya ya l am coming

1690
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:05,133
Dad There is somebody foryou

1691
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:12,749
l am a doctor who change
the grief of people with no children

1692
01:58:12,852 --> 01:58:14,843
Forthe first time l am in troubles...

1693
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:16,979
...after giving a baby
to a childless couple

1694
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:20,389
lf she files a case
will you be on our side?

1695
01:58:21,894 --> 01:58:24,863
Based on the old agreement
and the DNAtest

1696
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:28,591
...she will easily prove the boy is hers

1697
01:58:32,171 --> 01:58:33,695
lf we can not win the case...

1698
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,637
...why not we go for a compromise?

1699
01:58:35,741 --> 01:58:38,869
That is what l have also suggested
Acompromise

1700
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:41,978
But that is not on the premise
that you will not win the case

1701
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:45,846
Because for cases related to surrogacy...

1702
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,182
...there are not much
legal precedents in lndia

1703
01:58:48,754 --> 01:58:51,382
Besides as per lndian Law...

1704
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:53,583
the woman who delivers the baby...

1705
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,627
...will be considered
the mother of the baby

1706
01:58:55,761 --> 01:58:59,390
On that premise
Janaki is the mother of the baby here

1707
01:59:01,801 --> 01:59:04,099
But l am suggesting a compromise...

1708
01:59:04,237 --> 01:59:06,205
...taking in to account Lucky's future

1709
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:10,033
The small kid is gleefully happy...

1710
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:12,008
...should we drag him to court?

1711
01:59:13,546 --> 01:59:16,640
Not only that
for cases of this type...

1712
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:19,411
lt might take more than
5 years forfinal judgment

1713
01:59:19,519 --> 01:59:23,478
By the time he would
become 10 to 12 years old

1714
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,149
At that age he might be
able to comprehend

1715
01:59:27,527 --> 01:59:29,552
ln case he changes his mind...?

1716
01:59:32,098 --> 01:59:35,590
Why did you separate
him from his real mother...

1717
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:37,998
lf he poses this query to you then...

1718
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:41,867
lf he asks you why did you reject
him the comforts of American living?

1719
01:59:42,475 --> 01:59:47,640
lf he believes his life should
not end in Kodambakkam

1720
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:51,141
That day will he not
go looking for his mom?

1721
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:54,452
That will not happen
He is my son

1722
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:57,579
Kids are like arrows
released from the bow

1723
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:01,126
Beyond a certain limit
we can not control them

1724
02:00:01,827 --> 02:00:04,694
To answerthe queries posed by children...

1725
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:07,958
...parents search in
Google these days

1726
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:13,835
From his real mother and all comforts
you made him stay away

1727
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:16,497
lf he feels that was because
you both were self seeking

1728
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:17,870
Will he not hate you?

1729
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,080
lf mistakes can be rectified
it is always better to do that

1730
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:35,693
Day after tomorrow is
his skating competition

1731
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:40,825
Doctor inform this to her

1732
02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:36,919
Chennai roller skating Federation holds...

1733
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:40,056
...the 16th roller skating competition

1734
02:01:40,192 --> 02:01:42,922
We welcome you all

1735
02:01:43,162 --> 02:01:48,293
l request parents and
spectators to be seated quietly

1736
02:01:58,944 --> 02:02:01,242
So son Concentrate and run

1737
02:02:01,614 --> 02:02:03,309
Run well and win

1738
02:02:03,382 --> 02:02:06,044
Then only we can get admission
in Mount Carmel School

1739
02:02:06,218 --> 02:02:07,913

1740
02:02:09,922 --> 02:02:11,719
Careful
Careful

1741
02:02:24,203 --> 02:02:25,033
Bad smell

1742
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:28,663
lt is from this boy
The boy who fell in the drainage

1743
02:03:35,941 --> 02:03:37,169
Lucky

1744
02:03:39,912 --> 02:03:41,379
Lucky

1745
02:03:52,725 --> 02:03:54,454

1755
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:21,024
l went to your house

1756
02:07:22,167 --> 02:07:25,898
The kids said you are here

1757
02:07:26,538 --> 02:07:29,166
l gave the kids chocolates

1758
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:32,208
Lucky has won the skating competition

1759
02:07:37,416 --> 02:07:40,715
l saw your love for him

1760
02:07:40,953 --> 02:07:44,047
To encourage him to rise up
in case there is a fall for him in life...

1761
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:48,717
...and to show him the right path
whenever he goes wrong

1762
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:58,393
...perhaps a dad and mom like
you both would be better than me

1763
02:07:59,772 --> 02:08:04,106
So l have decided
not to take him with me

1764
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:10,113
lf he comes along with me
he would only get a mom

1765
02:08:10,315 --> 02:08:16,982
But here he has a dad, mom, sister
and so many others

1766
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:24,423
You must permit me to come
and see him once in a while

1767
02:08:24,797 --> 02:08:27,061
You need not tell him l am his mom

1768
02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:30,429
Tell him l am an aunty from America

1769
02:08:30,636 --> 02:08:32,501
That's enough for me

1770
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:41,769
But that is not the right thing to do

1771
02:08:42,381 --> 02:08:45,748
He should go and live
with his real mother

1772
02:08:49,455 --> 02:08:51,286
You must take him

1773
02:08:57,496 --> 02:09:05,460
Ratherthan he considering us as his foes
after knowing the truth years after...

1774
02:09:06,205 --> 02:09:10,164
...it is betterto part now
though it is painful

1775
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:14,212
But Lucky...

1776
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:20,114
We have a daughter to love and caress

1777
02:09:20,385 --> 02:09:22,114
But you don't have anyone Swapna

1778
02:09:22,588 --> 02:09:28,288
No woman should be in a situation
to say there is no one for her

1779
02:09:29,762 --> 02:09:32,595
Lucky would get on with anyone easily

1780
02:09:33,165 --> 02:09:35,395
He will love you too

1781
02:09:48,647 --> 02:09:51,445
For having won a small competition...

1782
02:09:51,617 --> 02:09:53,608
...he is going to America fortraining

1783
02:09:53,719 --> 02:09:55,846
That too...a small kid like him going alone

1784
02:09:56,221 --> 02:09:58,121
But he is not going alone...

1785
02:09:58,223 --> 02:10:00,589
There are other kids also
who have won the competition

1786
02:10:00,893 --> 02:10:03,828
Then...did not an aunty give you
chocolates the other day

1787
02:10:03,896 --> 02:10:05,727
That aunty is taking him

1788
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:08,197
But still something baffles me

1789
02:10:08,367 --> 02:10:12,064
You need not get excited over this
Go and study

1790
02:10:12,404 --> 02:10:16,602
Dad Sister is jealous
Don't mind it

1791
02:10:16,708 --> 02:10:18,141
l would go and come back

1792
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:21,644
After going there
l will go to Disney land, snow skating

1793
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:24,340
Enjoy everything and get back quickly

1794
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:27,613
Good boy

1795
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:46,104
Listen to what dad says carefully

1796
02:10:46,438 --> 02:10:48,235
And don't tell this to Lucky

1797
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:53,540
He is going with his real mother

1798
02:10:55,814 --> 02:10:59,409
The aunty who came
the other day is his real mother

1799
02:11:00,619 --> 02:11:05,921
He stayed with us like
a guest quite accidentally

1800
02:11:06,725 --> 02:11:09,523
When you grow up
l will tell you every thing

1801
02:11:09,661 --> 02:11:11,253
Will he not come back?

1802
02:11:11,363 --> 02:11:13,627
l can not live without him dad

1803
02:11:15,367 --> 02:11:16,527
You need not cry

1804
02:11:16,635 --> 02:11:20,298
Let us imagine he has gone to
some boarding school far away

1805
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:25,934
And we will wait for him
to come for every vacation

1806
02:12:07,786 --> 02:12:09,777
l have kept a CD in his bag

1807
02:12:10,722 --> 02:12:15,182
Every night l used to tell him tales

1808
02:12:15,327 --> 02:12:17,761
l have recorded all those in a CD

1809
02:12:17,963 --> 02:12:21,922
ln case he does not go to sleep easily
Play them once

1810
02:12:22,034 --> 02:12:23,558
He would go to sleep

1811
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:32,007
l am indebted to you
l knowthat can not be paid back

1812
02:12:32,244 --> 02:12:36,340
Forgive me for the anguish l have caused

1813
02:12:37,582 --> 02:12:41,382
Wherever he is
it's enough if he is happy

1814
02:12:41,853 --> 02:12:43,650
l want just that

1815
02:12:51,363 --> 02:12:53,388
- Bye sister
- Bye

1816
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:55,490
Bye dad

1817
02:13:00,372 --> 02:13:01,896
- Bye
- Bye

1818
02:13:29,634 --> 02:13:32,569
- Hi
- Hi

1819
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:34,328
Aunty stop

1820
02:13:41,646 --> 02:13:43,079
Lucky

1821
02:13:47,052 --> 02:13:50,283
Dad l have something to tell you

1822
02:13:50,922 --> 02:13:51,616
What's it?

1823
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:56,022
lf l like America l may extend
my stay there for some more time

1824
02:13:56,328 --> 02:14:00,526
Then only l will return
Don't chide me

1825
02:14:07,506 --> 02:14:08,632
Bye
