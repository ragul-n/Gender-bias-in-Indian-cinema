1
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,654
Today there is only darkness around
me nothing else

2
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,630
And l am the one responsible
for this darkness

3
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,898
But l can see one thing clearly
in this dark

4
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,433
What l have ruined

5
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,873
Only l can fix it nobody else

6
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,372
And tonight l will have to
do the same....

7
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,016
l don't know that will be my
victory or defeat

8
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,418
l don't even know that l will be
alive or l will have to die

9
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,022
that's why before leaving

10
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,626
l want to share my secret
with you

11
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,701
That secret what didn't started
from me

12
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,029
but it was started from Shanaya

13
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,402
Today l have come to you

14
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,512
Because tomorrow is an award function

15
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,748
My name is also include for
nomination for the best actress

16
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,055
And l must have to win that

17
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,154
Few new comers actress are
leaving behind me

18
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,062
And l want to defeat them

19
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,266
That's the last chance for me

20
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,690
l know....

21
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,396
l know everything

22
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,171
Whatever you told me till today

23
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,036
Everything was true

24
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,038
l believe in you from my heart

25
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,012
l do whatever you say....

26
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,916
So tell me where do l put
my head

27
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,217
What l should ask for....

28
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,926
Which stone l should wear....

29
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,386
what would fulfill my wish....

30
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,425
Why you are so upset?

31
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,069
God is with you.....
So why you are afraid?

32
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,838
You will must get that award

33
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,201
Your name is written on that

34
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,542
That's not my wish but
it's a God's wish

35
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,880
And until tomorrow's dawn
didn't appear

36
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,320
Don't take it off....

37
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,881
Just keep watching....

38
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,947
You will must get the award

39
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,766
First time l am getting award
for a movie

40
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,338
for whom l didn't work really hard

41
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,182
And l have come to realize that
only those movies are successful

42
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,908
what has been made with heart
not with the mind

43
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,061
From last many years many actresses
would have been won this award

44
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,202
Winners might change....

45
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,139
sometimes they won it over and
over again

46
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,302
and tonight

47
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,984
who is sitting around us

48
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,946
she is surrounded by her own silence

49
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,853
So she could hear her own name

50
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,860
You don't mind

51
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,734
lt's not your defeat

52
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,267
lt's your God's losing

53
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,469
Tushar!
Yes!

54
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,212
l was your employee

55
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,515
But l am still loyal to you

56
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,817
What do you want to say?

57
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,549
When God get defeat

58
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,185
So you should go to some
other force

59
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,722
And that force is undefeatable

60
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,986
l can take you over there

61
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,028
lf you want....

62
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,099
That's my number

63
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:03,857
For you!

64
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,685
So much pain

65
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,286
Anger....

66
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,155
Don't be silly!

67
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,187
Just for an award

68
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,589
That was my award

69
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,893
That was my right

70
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,704
l am being defeated from that
junior actress

71
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,204
She is snatching my place slowly

72
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,869
This world's door are opened
for everyone

73
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,309
Nobody can stop anyont to
become successful

74
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,351
And why do you hate Sanjana?

75
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,553
She is just another actress whose
time is with her

76
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,656
Whose movies are running

77
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,048
People like her

78
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,362
And l thought you came here for me

79
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,583
Come out from this world

80
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,819
From which stardom your
heart get broken

81
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,690
You will have to suffer so much pain

82
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,558
You should better forget it

83
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,632
Amazing!

84
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,969
Success didn't left me

85
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,408
and you gave me the advice
for get married

86
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,314
l can't through my stardom

87
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,151
l can't destroy it with my marriage

88
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,386
l have hidden this relationship
from three years

89
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,492
So l shouldn't be defammed

90
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,596
My life, my happiness

91
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,834
everything is my carrier

92
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:31,902
And me?

93
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,659
My phone is on....

94
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,668
And l came out from there

95
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,276
But she will go so far with
her anger

96
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,478
Nor l knew....

97
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,610
Nor she....

98
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,061
This man lives in this slums...
Yes!

99
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,369
You go and meet him

100
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,373
What do you mean?

101
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,537
You are not coming?
No!

102
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,510
My limit ends here

103
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,084
Don't be amazed Shanaya

104
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,549
lt's just a temple

105
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,289
What l have covered

106
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,097
like other temples of these slums...

107
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,899
Because this place is mine

108
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:44,960
Not a God's place

109
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,436
And only those people came here
who are refused by God

110
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,604
l am that person who you
are looking for....

111
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,611
Let's go!

112
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,727
Your mom has endured lot of pains

113
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,140
She tried to commit suicide

114
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,337
Twice!

115
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,739
She could not die....

116
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,473
She was wearing a ring in
her right hand's middle finger

117
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,319
Lord Durga Locket in her neck what
she never took off...

118
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,684
Temple in house....

119
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,853
She was lying there all day long

120
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,058
And one day when you came from
the school....

121
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,665
How do you know that?

122
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,170
Even my close friends doesn't
know that....

123
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,632
Because l am not human but a spirit

124
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,409
Somewhere in the middle of
earth and sky

125
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,946
We can make her sick with
Black Magic

126
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,845
We can make her disable

127
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,445
We can ruin her face

128
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,148
Even we can kill her

129
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,386
What do you want to do with Sanjana

130
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,825
That's the name of that girl

131
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,197
She is the reason of your visit

132
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,197
Yes!

133
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,367
She is the reason

134
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,641
She gave me lot of pain

135
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:12,813
She made me jealous alot

136
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,555
And l want to return all
these pains to her

137
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,851
But not to kill her

138
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,062
But to make her upset

139
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,896
Whatever you want to do
with her

140
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,067
You do it....

141
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,004
But my wish must come true

142
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,545
She must be finish

143
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,513
And she would also know

144
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,446
that how does it feel to lose
when you were about to win

145
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,021
That's it!

146
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,590
l have done Black Magic on this water

147
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,533
This water starts affects when it
mixed up with the blood

148
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,040
After that her soul will be
in my control

149
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,142
l will make her dance like puppet

150
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,815
Whatever will be happen with her

151
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,541
Entire world will see that

152
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,414
You will get everything you want

153
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,423
Remember one thing!

154
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,228
Black Magic effects only for a period

155
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,899
You will have to keep doing that

156
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,396
Until your wish doesn't come true

157
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,033
And that person shouldn't
be a servant

158
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,939
but that must be a trustable man

159
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,749
Do you have any trustable man?

160
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,755
Why l am feeling like?

161
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,700
You let me win intentionally

162
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,771
You know what victory meant for me

163
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,574
So why should l lose from you

164
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,950
May be it will be a victory of a big
game inside of any small game

165
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,685
You know me very well....

166
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,646
Sanjana will be your heroine

167
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,316
Why?

168
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,689
Because l want to destroy her

169
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,088
You will work with her

170
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,552
You will meet her everyday

171
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,192
You will stay close to her

172
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,588
And you will give her poison

173
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,033
What is this nonsense?

174
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,872
l should give her poison and kill her

175
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,438
This poison is not dangerous

176
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,678
She won't die!

177
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,410
But she will must want to die

178
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,252
lt is Black Magic

179
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,252
whose effect is in that water

180
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,361
What you will give her

181
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,133
l didn't understand what are
you saying

182
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,744
Look into my eyes

183
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,316
Can't you see my pain

184
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,381
My sorrow!

185
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:17,816
My defeat

186
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,722
You can see that

187
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,353
You can see that only you
can help me

188
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,425
You can give me all

189
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,434
what l want....

190
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,304
l don't need anything else

191
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,149
Give me my time back

192
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,850
My success

193
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,185
There is no other way

194
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,458
l am so alone!

195
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,435
l came here for Shanaya

196
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:08,967
not for Sanjana!

197
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,703
Sanjana is an enemy and Shanaya
is a friend

198
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,009
l came here for that woman

199
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,141
whom l love....

200
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,681
not for that woman who
needed love

201
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,749
Tonight

202
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,512
is your last night

203
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,924
After that nobody will survive

204
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,323
Not even you....

205
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,656
What was yours...

206
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,768
Now it's mine

207
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,066
So tell me

208
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,509
What happened with you that night,
l have told you

209
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,509
That's Mr. Mehra's fault

210
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,447
l don't want to say anything else

211
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,273
You are lying!

212
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,008
You are accusing a decent man

213
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,619
Give her the dialogues!

214
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,141
l am sorry!
Can l just take 5 minutes!

215
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,011
Yeah sure!

216
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,302
What happen?

217
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,599
l don't know

218
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,274
Last night l saw a nightmare

219
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,947
Earlier l thought somebody
is in my house

220
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,217
then suddenly TV has started
on and off

221
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:28,922
l heard a voice and....

222
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,984
And l don't know what else....

223
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,333
That's it!

224
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,797
Everyone have nightmares....

225
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,904
Why you are so upset?

226
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,106
You go to your room

227
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,675
l will send you special coffee

228
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,670
l have got news that Sanjana is
forgetting her dialogues

229
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,976
she can't complete her scene

230
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,143
lt's not like that...
She is not feeling well

231
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,712
lt's not about her condition

232
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,182
lt is the effect of those drops what
you gave her yesterday

233
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,695
What are you doing?

234
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,159
Few more days

235
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,031
Few more drops

236
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:44,459
For me!

237
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,800
This is very stupid!

238
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,171
lf you love me

239
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,368
You can be stupid for me

240
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,597
Your costume is ready

241
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,476
We are shooting in Studio 3

242
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,442
l am coming!
Thankyou!

243
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,499
lt's not an illusion

244
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,210
lt's reality

245
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,812
l can see it all

246
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:52,708
l am feeling it

247
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,553
Do you have any problem in
these days?

248
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,719
Any stress?

249
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,926
Any recent incident?

250
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,925
Like someone's death in
your family

251
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,029
lncidents comes and gone in life

252
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,667
But....

253
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,202
that doesn't make illsuions....

254
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,606
l want to run a test....

255
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,946
Shanaya your black magic is
affecting Sanjana

256
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,420
l have see whatever is happening
with her

257
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,529
What's happening to her?

258
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,956
Tell me every details

259
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,767
Are you insane?

260
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,431
Have you lost your mind?

261
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:24,774
Why we are doing all this?

262
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,199
What do you want from this girl?

263
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,602
She is decent, alone and her
mom is even died....

264
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,537
Until she was alive her father
didn't live with her

265
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,371
She spend her entire life
without her father

266
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,279
Because she snatched my dad...

267
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,304
Devashi Shekhar was my dad....

268
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,068
And her too

269
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,846
Her mom was my dad's keep

270
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,746
She has taken my mom's place

271
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:13,916
And then she was born

272
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,422
And then she has taken my place

273
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,229
My right on which dad's love

274
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,395
She got that right from me

275
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,375
When bad time came

276
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,048
He gave my things to her

277
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:48,921
My clothes!

278
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,082
My shoes!

279
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,688
My happinesses

280
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,489
My childhood!

281
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,445
My career is not my dad what
she will snatch

282
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,047
my fame is not my toys with whom
she will play

283
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,523
And my happinesses are not my shoes
what will fit in her feet

284
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,156
That's why you will do the same

285
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:26,893
what l want....

286
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,155
What l am saying

287
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,933
l have given you alot

288
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,227
l am your toxication,
l am your habit!

289
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,708
Your career is because of me

290
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,233
l want that price

291
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,078
So tell me

292
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,443
You will have to pay the price
or not

293
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,348
Yes or No!

294
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,821
Look at the smoke carefully!

295
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:13,672
Did you see something?

296
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,238
No!

297
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,181
Look carefully!

298
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,205
Bad news!

299
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,748
Very bad news!

300
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,484
What Sanjana can see...

301
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,782
We can't see that

302
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:01,924
lt means

303
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:06,321
that some spirit has captured
Sanjana's spirit

304
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,088
What?

305
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,892
Whose spirit is that?

306
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,001
We will have to find out

307
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:16,329
And we will have to go in
that spirit's world

308
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,266
Spirit's world?

309
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,945
ls there any world like that?
Yes!

310
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:26,945
ln which world we live

311
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,408
They have the same world....

312
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,014
The difference is that

313
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,918
that bodies doesn't live there

314
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,717
only spirits lives there....

315
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,791
Sanjana's spirit is captured
in that world

316
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,060
We will have to release her

317
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,731
But it could be dangerous to anyone

318
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,098
There is no other way?
No!

319
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,637
We can enter to spirit's world
from there...

320
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,943
where life and death present together

321
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,279
Graveyard!

322
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,584
But l can't do this....

323
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:08,988
l don't have that strength

324
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,859
Rajdev will meet you there

325
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,196
in the middle of night and morning

326
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,260
Who is doing this black magic on you

327
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,453
Sit between these graves....

328
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,866
Until this act doesn't over nobody
will speak

329
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,302
You can go from here

330
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,115
Give me your hand

331
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,424
But for what?

332
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,519
lt will be difficult to find you
in spirit's world

333
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,791
lf l will be attach with you

334
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,896
then it will be lead us to your spirit

335
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:26,664
And one more thing

336
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,304
Only my spirit will
go that world

337
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,703
but my body will remain here

338
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,302
lf l would been attacked on
that world

339
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,906
that my body will be hert

340
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,206
That's the law....

341
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,746
lf any wound will come to my body

342
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:46,789
then don't be scared!

343
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,619
Control yourself!

344
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,093
And don't leave this relation

345
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,328
Otherwise this act will be incomplete

346
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,594
And you will never get peace....

347
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:31,459
l have come to release your spirit

348
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,556
to take it back to your body

349
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,495
But how did this water came here

350
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:44,368
My spirit...

351
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,966
is captured because of this water

352
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,275
Somebody is using this water

353
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,908
Don't worry!

354
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,381
Once l will take you across this light

355
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,849
Once you'll be release from this world
then you will be back to your world

356
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,914
Help me!

357
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:14,713
l am opening!

358
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,125
Nothing will happen to you

359
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,992
He will kill me

360
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,828
Listen to me!

361
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,063
l have seen many rascals!

362
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,669
But l have never seen rascal like you

363
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,062
l have brought you from down
to sky

364
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,040
l have made you from assistant
to film director

365
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,741
l gave you position, power

366
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,473
After sleeping with younger sister

367
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,578
You have forgotten elder sister's bed

368
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,288
from your career has been started

369
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,094
Whatever l am just because
of my abilities

370
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,220
not because of your influence

371
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,697
l love her and l will always love her

372
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,501
Because these are the heart relations
and nobody plan them

373
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,272
Only people like you plan them
for their own fun

374
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:47,664
for your own needs

375
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,173
You gave me shelter for
your own needs

376
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,143
And you are making Sanjana ill
for your own....

377
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,847
You are killing innocent people
for that crown

378
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,482
what you will never have

379
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,917
lt's not true!
That's the truth!

380
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,755
Your time is over

381
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,624
lt's Sanjana's time

382
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,728
You will have to stop this
Black Magic

383
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,732
Because only l am the witness
of this thing

384
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,005
that people died because of you

385
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,402
My one statement can ruin your life

386
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,359
One secret is in your heart

387
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,062
and l also have a secret

388
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,467
what will not spare you

389
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,605
You don't know whom l made
my God....

390
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:16,485
lt's the strange time

391
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:20,228
lt has brought me back

392
01:18:21,367 --> 01:18:23,597
from where l have started
my journey

393
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:27,300
But this time everything is different

394
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:30,408
Now l don't have happiness

395
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:32,401
only sadness

396
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:36,976
Now l don't have crowd

397
01:18:40,219 --> 01:18:41,982
only loneliness...

398
01:18:49,795 --> 01:18:50,955
Get the chair1

399
01:19:06,578 --> 01:19:07,602
You are coming upstairs!

400
01:19:08,447 --> 01:19:09,675
or l come down!

401
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,934
What the hell are you doing here?

402
01:19:42,915 --> 01:19:44,382
What kind of situation is that?

403
01:19:45,818 --> 01:19:47,513
Friends have met the enemies

404
01:19:49,822 --> 01:19:50,618
No problem!

405
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:54,257
lt happens when you are in love

406
01:19:55,127 --> 01:19:57,118
l also have a sickness

407
01:19:57,863 --> 01:19:58,795
What should l do?

408
01:19:59,998 --> 01:20:03,934
Only you can cure it

409
01:20:17,382 --> 01:20:18,178
lt's wide shot!

410
01:20:18,617 --> 01:20:19,709
but camera is good

411
01:20:26,258 --> 01:20:28,419
When your girlfriend will
watch this dvd

412
01:20:29,728 --> 01:20:31,195
then she will feel very bad

413
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:35,798
She couldn't tolerate it

414
01:20:36,802 --> 01:20:38,531
that whom she thinks her hero

415
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:41,666
He is the worst villain of
her life

416
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:49,206
Take it!

417
01:20:50,015 --> 01:20:52,108
Finish the job what you have taken

418
01:20:53,786 --> 01:20:54,650
And remember!

419
01:20:55,988 --> 01:20:58,752
lf Sanjana will create the scene
on shoot

420
01:21:00,092 --> 01:21:02,083
then l will understand that you
have supported me

421
01:21:02,694 --> 01:21:05,629
And if l will see her happy

422
01:21:07,099 --> 01:21:09,363
then l will understand that
you have supported her

423
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:12,161
And you know....

424
01:21:12,805 --> 01:21:14,500
that what will l do with
this dvd?

425
01:22:30,415 --> 01:22:31,439
Breakfast for you!

426
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:41,216
How did l came here?

427
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:43,451
What kind of place is this?

428
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:45,318
That's my beach house

429
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:47,932
Far away from the city

430
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:51,936
l have kidnapped you....

431
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:54,901
Kidnap!

432
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:56,769
Away from the city?

433
01:22:57,676 --> 01:22:59,871
And l didn't know...
lt happens

434
01:23:03,248 --> 01:23:04,715
People who doesn't have
burden on their heart

435
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:07,042
They sleep like this

436
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:11,413
l got the advantage and here we are

437
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:15,216
By the way l got this place to
spend few peacefull moments

438
01:23:16,395 --> 01:23:18,329
But l didn't had any excuse to came
here till yesterday

439
01:23:20,265 --> 01:23:21,960
Today l have got excuse with you,
Really!

440
01:23:22,768 --> 01:23:25,032
And what about the shooting?

441
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:29,439
l have spoken to producer and
got few days leave

442
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:31,902
l told him that l like this girl

443
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:34,508
l want to take her along

444
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:36,909
Because l will have to
take care of her

445
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:40,450
So to hell with the movie

446
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:42,777
You wouldn't have said like that

447
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:44,948
Not like that....

448
01:24:04,843 --> 01:24:05,901
Sanjana!

449
01:24:10,515 --> 01:24:11,504
l wanna talk to you

450
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:13,443
Yes!
Speak!

451
01:24:17,389 --> 01:24:18,515
l wanted to talk to you from few days

452
01:24:19,658 --> 01:24:20,647
What's the matter?

453
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:27,891
But l think you won't understand

454
01:24:31,703 --> 01:24:33,193
And you will leave me

455
01:24:38,143 --> 01:24:38,973
What's the matter?

456
01:24:42,748 --> 01:24:43,646
l...

457
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:54,357
l have decided to love you like crazy

458
01:25:03,969 --> 01:25:04,936
You have scared me

459
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:07,466
Look how my heart is beating

460
01:25:11,576 --> 01:25:12,474
you are crazy!

461
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:25,495
You must know her

462
01:28:25,804 --> 01:28:27,032
Who doesn't know her?

463
01:28:31,676 --> 01:28:33,166
You will stay there

464
01:28:33,745 --> 01:28:34,837
or you will come in

465
01:28:37,115 --> 01:28:38,707
Only few people know one thing

466
01:28:39,351 --> 01:28:40,841
that we both are....
Sisters....

467
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,058
Our moms are different but...
Our dad was a same person

468
01:28:50,962 --> 01:28:52,361
We met like this after many years

469
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,100
Shanaya has brought a dvd
to show us

470
01:29:18,757 --> 01:29:19,781
lt's just a 2 minutes promo

471
01:29:20,825 --> 01:29:22,588
and everything will be over
in 2 minutes

472
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:31,333
This movie has shots like you
have never seen before

473
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:36,339
Film director is very talented

474
01:29:43,415 --> 01:29:44,848
l think dvd is empty

475
01:29:48,353 --> 01:29:49,820
l think l have brought
wrong dvd

476
01:29:52,657 --> 01:29:53,646
lt happens....

477
01:30:05,236 --> 01:30:06,635
lt could be a real dvd

478
01:30:07,505 --> 01:30:08,870
You are so stupid

479
01:30:09,741 --> 01:30:10,639
What did you think?

480
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:12,806
You will save her on this
beach house

481
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:17,179
And l will never know that you
have brought her here

482
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:18,712
What do you want?

483
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:21,610
Tomorrow there is a film
success party

484
01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:24,684
Many famous people will
come there

485
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:29,084
Film Producer wants to sign
Sanjana for his next movie

486
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:31,824
And l want you to do

487
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:33,695
what you have been doing yet

488
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:36,231
Make her a scene

489
01:30:36,801 --> 01:30:38,792
l have told you....
You will do it

490
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:46,577
And your love story is in
danger right now....

491
01:39:29,367 --> 01:39:32,768
This accident has her brain

492
01:39:46,317 --> 01:39:48,376
Sanjana can't work in our movie

493
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:51,917
lt's not her fault

494
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:57,017
Look!

495
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:00,360
We need hindi movie actress

496
01:40:01,432 --> 01:40:02,421
Not a pornstar

497
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,864
Here is your signing amount cheque
and contract copy

498
01:40:10,341 --> 01:40:12,366
But l am feeling very guilty

499
01:41:25,249 --> 01:41:26,477
Now what do you want?

500
01:41:26,984 --> 01:41:28,281
you have got what you wanted

501
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:33,916
Sanjana is my sister

502
01:41:34,692 --> 01:41:35,556
She is sick

503
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:37,493
l didn't came here to take anything
but to give her

504
01:41:38,996 --> 01:41:40,896
l have brought soup for her

505
01:41:47,071 --> 01:41:47,867
Think!

506
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:50,898
She came naked in party after
having chocolates

507
01:41:51,842 --> 01:41:53,002
now what she will do after
having this soup

508
01:42:07,558 --> 01:42:08,957
Your condition is worse
because of her

509
01:42:09,693 --> 01:42:13,527
Your fear is because of Black Magic

510
01:42:16,967 --> 01:42:18,628
But how do you know that?

511
01:42:23,908 --> 01:42:24,772
Who is doing this?

512
01:42:28,245 --> 01:42:29,143
Who is that person?

513
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,513
Me!

514
01:42:35,519 --> 01:42:36,486
and Shanaya

515
01:42:39,256 --> 01:42:40,245
She hates you

516
01:42:41,192 --> 01:42:42,352
She wants to destroy you

517
01:42:44,061 --> 01:42:45,119
And l have supported her

518
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:49,530
For the sake of few needs

519
01:42:53,104 --> 01:42:54,366
She had everything

520
01:42:54,939 --> 01:42:55,906
What l have been greed for

521
01:42:57,241 --> 01:42:58,299
She fullfilled my dreams

522
01:42:59,243 --> 01:43:00,175
She gave me everything

523
01:43:00,945 --> 01:43:01,843
what l needed for....

524
01:43:55,566 --> 01:43:57,056
Now l will do whatever you want

525
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,241
First you both destroyed me

526
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:11,805
And now you want me to
take decision

527
01:44:16,353 --> 01:44:18,321
But what will happen to decide

528
01:44:32,736 --> 01:44:34,169
Look at me!

529
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:37,464
l have lost everything

530
01:44:43,514 --> 01:44:46,244
You both have naked me in
front of everyone

531
01:44:53,891 --> 01:44:56,451
Child and dog only needs love

532
01:45:00,264 --> 01:45:02,630
And my dad just loved me

533
01:45:04,969 --> 01:45:06,197
Alot love!

534
01:45:08,572 --> 01:45:11,405
Not Shanaya's share but my
share of love

535
01:45:19,116 --> 01:45:21,710
Today l have known that it's a
sin to love someone

536
01:45:30,828 --> 01:45:32,318
She would have asked me once

537
01:45:35,432 --> 01:45:39,698
l would give my fame to her
and appologize to her

538
01:45:41,972 --> 01:45:44,031
But she never asked me

539
01:45:45,509 --> 01:45:49,275
Not her share of love from dad,
nor her share of fame from me

540
01:45:53,951 --> 01:45:55,179
Go away from here

541
01:45:59,456 --> 01:46:00,980
You can't do anything

542
01:58:54,197 --> 01:58:55,630
There must be a solution to save her

543
01:58:57,667 --> 01:59:00,158
That same way what we
have taken earlier

544
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:06,937
We'll have to release Sanjana's spirit
from the spirit's world

545
01:59:09,145 --> 01:59:09,804
l will go there

546
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:11,503
You?

547
01:59:13,349 --> 01:59:15,214
That's not a normal spirit

548
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:18,344
That's a dangerous spirit

549
01:59:19,456 --> 01:59:20,946
That spirit has killed my student

550
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:23,216
That won't spare you

551
01:59:24,694 --> 01:59:28,186
ln this act your body and spirit
would be harmed

552
01:59:30,033 --> 01:59:32,797
and you can die as well

553
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:38,835
l am the only responsible for
Sanjana's condition

554
01:59:40,176 --> 01:59:41,404
l will go there to rescue her

555
01:59:45,915 --> 01:59:46,609
Fine!

556
01:59:48,251 --> 01:59:50,481
lf you are insisting then fine

557
01:59:52,021 --> 01:59:54,046
But this act could be done there

558
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:57,458
when life and death meets together

559
01:59:58,928 --> 02:00:02,864
We will have to take Sanjana
to Graveyard right now....

560
02:00:09,806 --> 02:00:13,333
l won't give you the permission to
take Sanjana from hospital

561
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:15,701
No! l am sorry!
Then this act can't be done

562
02:00:22,919 --> 02:00:23,681
There is one solution

563
02:00:24,654 --> 02:00:25,120
What?

564
02:00:26,222 --> 02:00:27,484
Do you have morgue in hospital

565
02:00:27,957 --> 02:00:28,946
Yes!
Why?

566
02:00:32,228 --> 02:00:34,753
That's the place where dead and
alive people met

567
02:00:40,436 --> 02:00:42,768
This act could be done in morgue

568
02:01:11,134 --> 02:01:15,036
Aditya is in morgue

569
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:20,969
He is going to spirit's world
to save Sanjana

570
02:01:28,151 --> 02:01:30,676
lf Aditya will go there and win

571
02:01:31,421 --> 02:01:34,390
You will have to seperate them
right now

572
02:01:53,176 --> 02:01:54,108
You go!

573
02:01:54,377 --> 02:01:56,368
Once MRl will be done then
l will call you

574
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:59,171
Close the door

575
02:02:09,559 --> 02:02:10,287
Come!

576
02:02:10,793 --> 02:02:13,057
Before somebody shall come we
should leave

577
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:35,210
Till morning

578
02:02:35,652 --> 02:02:36,584
Nor you will come here

579
02:02:36,986 --> 02:02:39,580
Nor you will let anyone come here
Now leave!

580
02:02:57,307 --> 02:02:58,797
l will lock the door

581
02:03:00,109 --> 02:03:01,633
We will have to start this act now

582
02:03:02,045 --> 02:03:03,137
You lay down there

583
02:03:36,446 --> 02:03:37,606
You won't kill him

584
02:03:39,649 --> 02:03:41,480
But you can let him away for
few moments

585
02:05:38,434 --> 02:05:39,458
l have come to rescue you

586
02:05:41,337 --> 02:05:41,894
Let's go!

587
02:05:46,609 --> 02:05:47,667
For what?

588
02:05:50,012 --> 02:05:51,639
l have no reason to live

589
02:05:54,383 --> 02:05:55,350
l am your sinner

590
02:05:57,453 --> 02:05:59,751
Nor l am able for your forgiveness
nor your love

591
02:06:01,123 --> 02:06:02,385
But l love you

592
02:06:03,092 --> 02:06:04,320
and l will always love you

593
02:06:05,461 --> 02:06:07,361
And only my God is the
witness of that

594
02:06:08,764 --> 02:06:09,856
And l swear to him

595
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:11,832
that if my love is not true

596
02:06:14,036 --> 02:06:15,799
then l will die in this world

597
02:06:49,939 --> 02:06:50,769
Go away from here

598
02:06:51,774 --> 02:06:52,900
He will kill you

599
02:07:29,445 --> 02:07:31,413
That spirit has attacked on Aditya...

600
02:20:32,928 --> 02:20:35,055
Nobody can beat me now....

601
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,525
Nobody can see me like this

602
02:20:43,972 --> 02:20:45,940
That's my secret

603
02:20:46,842 --> 02:20:48,833
and it will go with me

604
02:20:55,083 --> 02:20:56,573
l am Shanaya

605
02:20:57,919 --> 02:20:59,784
l was a star

606
02:21:23,111 --> 02:21:24,840
No!

607
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,376
Don't be silly

608
02:21:36,658 --> 02:21:37,716
Don't be silly!

609
02:23:15,156 --> 02:23:18,717
Few people destroyed their lives
for that fame

610
02:23:19,494 --> 02:23:22,986
what has been buried in time's
graveyard one day

611
02:23:24,199 --> 02:23:26,599
They forgot that who has born
with the sand

612
02:23:27,269 --> 02:23:28,827
He will have to bury in sand

613
02:23:30,238 --> 02:23:32,729
lf something remains then
that's our good act

614
02:23:33,808 --> 02:23:34,536
Sacrifice

615
02:23:47,122 --> 02:23:48,020
That's the secret

616
02:23:48,957 --> 02:23:50,288
whose name is life....
